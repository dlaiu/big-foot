Alabama,"we went back to the sight the next morning and we found a small foot print about 8 inches long and a big foot print about 13 inches long in sight of where we seen it tall  His head seemed normal, but there was so much hair it was hard to make out his features except where the hair was thinner The most distinguishing feature was its arms, slump shouldered and its hands were below its knees The creature I saw was extremely large, I would have to say now that it was at least 7 feet tall very broad shoulders, covered from head to toe in dark brown to black hair, his mouth and large, square teeth kind of stuck out from the rest of the face and the eyes were sunk in On January 23rd 2013 between 4:30 and 5pm while deer hunting I heard what I thought was a coyote making noise behind me but then I heard foot steps, loud foot steps coming toward me that's when I saw what I can say was a bigfoot coming up the draw to my left about 70 yards away it came out of the draw and turned left and went away from me I saw a harry creature standing about 7 1/2 to 8 ft tall staring back at me We all laughed because we had not heard of any other Bigfoot sightings in lower Alabama I knew what I had heard sounded like the sound the bigfoot made on the programs I had watched on TV and at first I even thought I was crazy for even thinking that that's what it could have been and Iv'e tried my best to convince myself there's no way it could have been a bigfoot but it hasn't worked  I thought it was a tall pole but it looked to be wavering in the breeze that was blowing As he looked around for horse or cow tracks, another person walked over to look at it and said ""Look at the size of these foot prints"" so we decided to wait until just before dark to try again So that got me to thinking, maybe that afternoon in the woods I really did see a Bigfoot  I was out there just thinking and staring off at the woods when something caught my eye--after refocusing on it I realized there were legs, then arms, then I could clearly make out his face At first I was not sure what they may have been however after considering the strange activites I felt they could very well have been bigfoots We started walking it was getting late almost dark we started to smell something I checked and in the middle was a footprint THE HEAD WAS IN THE BIGFOOT'S LEFT HAND Figure that was slightly slouched that was hairy and about 9-10 feet tall He kept staring at us with his eyes stretched very wide We never used this door because we had no steps to it and the door was about 4 feet from the ground  It stood, obviously broad and manlike and BIG, looking at them as they drove off, its arms at its sides and longer than a man's arms  He was completely stiff, with the hair standing up on his back and neck and he was growling very low and menacingly That five foot tall sagebrush was strikeing hin about the waste.It was in plaine sight for about fifty yards and turned and went back into the woods It was covered in long hair maybe 4-6 inches long  He had a long shaggy beard around his facial area, but he was completely naked but for the long shaggy hair that was in matts all over his body As I did I saw a dark figure at the back of our SUV  We stared at it forever it seemed.until it opened it's eyes - two huge balls of red (reflecting off the headlights of our car I imagine) light and looked at us Large footprints, feces, and a trail into the woods not far from where I had seen this ""thing"" It was very tall and massive yet lean looking  He was between 7 and 8 feet tall more on the skinny side but still big This has been going on now for three weeks in March 2012, almost every night just about 8:30, or right before it getting dark seven to eight feet tall, walking with its back to me With that light and the light on the cord that I had hanging from one of the tall fence post, the area where I was working was well lit   All the hair was grayish white and very long and shaggy Long arms no neck as plain as day I saw bigfoot twice in Chance, Alabama and my mom seen him also He saw a large black or brown hairy figure stepping out of the woods as he was coming around a curve I could not see the color of his eyes or anything like that  It had brown hair covering its body, appeared to have no neck, very long arms, took long strides I have a cast of a left and right foot  Off to my right about 60 feet was where the foliage began I thought, ""what is this guy doing running across the highway out here?"" I could see shoulders moving and arms swinging Stunned, we looked at each other and Bigfoot started running back towards us The hair on back of my neck did Note: I have never been a believer of Bigfoot before but what I saw that day is something I can’t stop thinking about. I had purchased a fence for my cats and my husband and I had spent most of the day putting it up .We stopped working on it that evening so we could have time to feed the animals-horses,dogs chickens and cats- before dark  Not once did it occur to me to pick them up and use them! A side note Two weeks earlier two boys had found large human like footprints in that region somewhere as reported in a local newspaper i saw no foot prints, but i did notice a strange musky odor in the air. In my headlights I could see it was covered in grey-brown hair He saw something setting on a hill that looked like a huge hairy thing that had a face like a man... I was fishing and I heard what was two bigfoots fighting and when i shined my spotlight across the creek, two large brown hairy looking caveman looking things ran swiftly up the hill and i reeled in my poles and got the hell out of there We saw what looked like Bigfoot peeking around a tree at us with all my hair standing straight-up, we heard the next sound~~~>  a chuuu..chuuu..chuuu..chuuuuuuu.. In the ditch line was Bigfoot, about 8 ft  This went on for quite a while...I also noticed a foul odor but could not pin point it's source..I thought it was my husbands usual bout of, well to put it delicately, indigestion...I eventually saw a very tall figure and told my husband that someone was in the woods and he was standing between two tall pine trees...He thought I was crazy and laughed it off...I never stopped looking and saw this figure sway from side to side...from tree to tree..never approached...never made a sound I turned to go into the house and looked back and distinctly saw what could only be Bigfoot running away It looked like a human foot.The print was about a size 9 or 10 in shoe sizes but only about 3 1/2"" wide and was approx  Estimated height near 7 feet About 100 feet away, with our car lights fully shining on the it, we saw this massive, black creature leaning on the sign  There were broken limbs and saplings and hair all around it ) He then ask "" what did it sound like?"" I hesitated for a second or two  before  I said "" A Bigfoot "" He said back to me  ""well, like said it could be some sort of canine or something like that."" When he said that, I started crying - I couldn't help myself, I cried and told him that this was no joke that I was serious and that I was scared to death now  A friend of mine had just dropped me off after football practice It had rained earlier in the afternoon and evening and as we came back to re-enter our house confident that what I had seen ran away we noticed footprints on the concrete patio deck when we got upbj shined his 6 cell light at the woodline and we caught a glimpse of something stepping back and stopped looking back where it had came, about then we hears the same series of sounds and the deer rather than go back ran within 20 feet of us in the opposite direction Is it ""bigfoot"" I've no idea but its something.. The creature lifted its left arm, possibly to shield its eyes or perhaps anticipating being hit as I was about thirty feet from it Unlike a dog the creature had a human like face that was the only part of its body not covered in long reddish brown hair The hand like finger had hair on it dark brown 21 about 1 mile from my home when up ahead I saw these dark figures approach the side of the road I recall that there were two and I'm pretty sure a third distinct grouping of footfalls to my left and two off to my right  As I watched something on two legs appeared roughly 100ft from my position from out of the thicket I asked my friend what in the hell was that? He replied that it was probably what some of the old farmhands referred to over the years as the hairy man, which some of them had told of seeing from time to time for many years We then continued to move downhill toward my vehicle but whatever they were kept back a bit and out of our sight and also to our sides yet they kept moving down along with us, not trying to hide their footfalls My husband, myself and my husbands friend were walking on a narrow trail to Salt Creek Falls near Talladega National Forest  To set the scene:  Our car was parked about two feet from the water, on the bank I tried to replicate the depth with my foot but I had to stomp in the dirt with the heel of my boot to replicate the depth of the print   Their ""caper"" was interrupted when they heard heavy footsteps running through the woods toward them, breaking limbs, etc It stood to be about 7 to 9 feet tall as i can remember, judging now by the trees and fence The only thing I could think of was Bigfoot He said this creature was very wide and had “fluffy” hair which covered it entirely It didn't look at me, but I noticed long hair from its arms, legs and also shoulders seven foot high, and numerous large footprints, similar to a humans, but with no arch and a very large great toe He also said that from what he could see the creature appeared to be a dark brown or black color  Also, I had never heard of a whitish gray colored bigfoot, and this creature was thinner than a typical bigfoot description- maybe he was older or maybe even younger The tracks went about 20 feet then turned left into the freshly plowed field (plowed the day before) A large creature, about 6.5 feet tall and covered with hair, crossed the road in front of me in broad daylight at about 3 PM We would like to add that local legends about the ""Grand Bay Wolfman"" are numerous and we heard stories about the "" hairy  man monster "" that likes to sit on bridges at night our entire lives, but up until we saw this thing for ourselves we never took them seriously. I climbed into my ladder stand and my father went to the draw where I saw the creature and walked the same path and the creature I saw was at least 2 feet taller then my father my stands father 6 feet 4. I've thought about what everyone around where I live would be saying about me if they found out that I said I had heard bigfoot in the woods behind my house The subject that my brother saw was between 8-9 ft tall  About 40 feet further up the bank (which can't be seen from our car because of the foliage) is a huge oak tree  I could clearly see that it was on two feet and did not pay me any attention  He stood right in front of me at a distance of 5 to 10 feet, he was tall, but hunched and quietly staring right at me It had our hearts beating wildly and the hair standing up on our arms  it raised straight upon two legs had long arms broad shoulders and stood about 7 to 8 foot tall, very hairy (I say that because I have a pair of shoes owned by an NBA star that my nephew gave me who is on an NBA coaching staff.) My point, these were very large feet and very wide strides It had long blonde to light brown hair all over Driving on paved road, sighting was maybe 20 yards away, creature exited woods as I crested a hill, crossed right of way and road with four-five strides at incredible speed My daughter said what was that I was like I have no idea , it was massive and very wide across the shoulders and it’s head seemed to just sit on top of its huge shoulders, like this thing was taller and wider than anything I’ve ever seen and moved with unreal speed  He looked to the right of the road and saw a large dark figure walking through the tall weeds that were beside the road However, being at that age I did not want to go outside alone after dark for any reason including to use the bathroom From the top of this hill the river was almost visible about a mile away through the darkness I happened to look off toward the tree line for no reason that I recall, and I saw perhaps several hundred feet off, a tall reddish manlike creature with no apparent neck, standing off in the shadows of the treeline HE WAS CARRYING IT FROM THE DOG HAIR AT THE TOP OF THE DOG HEAD When I was about 8 or 10 yrs old, I saw a Bigfoot It must have hit the animal because it gave a loud shriek and ran up the creek away from us, then jumping back up on the bank, a seven foot jump, and running back behind our campsite He told me he had no doubts at all that “Bigfoot” was around but he would never do anything to harm it and he felt that if left alone it would not harm anyone  The only reason I never thought of it as a bigfoot before was that I had never heard of an Alabama bigfoot, so the thought never entered my mind 8 or 9 feet, well built, and very hairy  There were two distinct foot steps instead of four like a deer  I passed the creature and didn't catch it in my mirrors as it was dark  There were tufts of deer hair hung in the bark of two larger trees next to the carcass  A bigfoot jumped out in front of me, I fell off my bike and he stood over me, and howled/growled not  feet away from me It looked to be 9 or 10 feet tall, larger that anything I wanted to stop for we found some hair on a fence and metal poles that have been step on and bent over the fence was pulled up off the post and bottom fence all the way to the ground  He wasn't much taller than a normal man, but I got the impression he was old because he was hunching I pulled some branches back and there it was, about 20 feet running away on 2 legs at a very fast pace It came up to three feet of me, grunted and walked off And as we came over a hill and something huge and black darted across the road on two feet and into the woods about 50 yards ahead  The hill is about 100 feet high from what I remember My husband keeps saying that he believes I had heard something and that there's a good explanation for it because there's no such thing as a bigfoot   Whatever it was, had to have been about 10 feet tall to cast a shadow that far up on the windows  These were trails that myself as well as the other neighborhood kids frequented often on bikes as well as foot It looked like it might have been about 7 foot but it could have been more or less There is an arch to both, showing it is not flatfooted It was dark in color, black I think,( this I know because it was a sunny day), it stood upright    The tracks then turned left again into an area of tall grass, small pines and other small trees that lined a field at the edge of the woods We were riding along cherokee road in Prescot, a comunity near Moody Al.when rounding a curve we saw what looked like an ape man but humanlike exept for the hair,which was all matted and black.it was about 7ft tall and had long arms my wife and I turned around but it was gone.  I froze and it froze and we both stared at each other, then somehow I thought of my daughter and her safety and I immediately grabbed her and ran inside screaming at my husband to get his gun, there was a Bigfoot outside When my eyes caught something  It was MUCH taller than the 6 ft fence there and it appeared to be black with maybe a little silver or grey mixed in I AM 6 FEET TALL AT THE TIME AND THE WEEDS WERE OVER MY HEAD It was 7 feet tall or so and crossed a clearing in the woods that was at least 15 feet wide in two steps with a normal stride,not running, just out for a stroll We then proceeded to follow the footprints to where, amonst downed trees and foliage, we found where a large animal had been laying There were 2 prints,1 looked like it was walking out of the creek and stepped up on the bank with just the ball of its foot, then the track beside it was a full print as decribed before. I was maybe within 50 feet of the creek when off to my left side I heard a lot of movement approximately 150-200 feet into the woods appearing to come from the creek bank I heard another grunt and peered into the woods from where the sound came from and saw a large “shadow”…easily 6 to 7 foot tall stand from the creek bed 8-9 feet tall, extremely broad shoulders, matted reddish-brown fur After finding your website and reading about the bigfoot killing deer, I now know that it hasn't been poachers killing all of our deer all of the sudden something large much taller than myself( I am 6'8""tall) rushed me  Both of the deer's back legs were broken and twisted  But I had a neighbor that had told about seeing a bigfoot on his property a few years earlier and everybody laughed at him  Honestly, I didn't realize bigfoot were sighted in this part of the country at that time, or even for most of my life, and just seeing all those other sightings was a revelation What we saw was very disturbing....it appeared to be an up right figure, that was hairy and had a grey tent to its fure And right there across the dried mud in the fire brake is a set of foot prints dried into the mud.they were not huge they were about the size of a full grown man but they did look human, I just couldn't understand why a man would be this far back in the woods without shoes on.And over the years there is one thing I have thought about a bigfoot would have to grow up, so maybe it was a young bigfoot First of all I would like to say that I am a city girl and educated in medical science and not familiar with such things as Big Foot  I remember describing how he was old looking, hunched, naked, and his hair was very long and matted like he hadn't cut it in 20 years The arms hung beside it and hands were nearly touching the knees As we turned off the road, the headlights caught a figure in mid-stride I would say it was easily over 7 feet tall, if not more We would describe it as a tall, wide, black from head to toe creature walking upright on two legs trying to quickly get in to the woods I IN THE TIME THAT DROVE BY SLOWLY SAW THE BIGFOOT FROM THE KNEES UP, CARRYING THE HEAD OF THE DOG, SOME FLESH WAS HANGING FROM THE NECK AREA We found hair there also  The top of the sign I guessed to be about 10 feet it got so dark that couln't see mpre than 25-30 meters so we decided to call it quits for the day There you could tell where it paused to squat repositioning it's feet to do so and did it's business Each foot has 5 toes  Hair was described as long and not shaggy, but ""fluffy,"" dark brown or black  I was spooked and the hair stood up on the back of my neck It was also about this time that we started hearing rather heavy footsteps (It was dry although it had rained the night before)  One of the Marriott employee's saw two large footprints --more like deep indention's in the pine straw--I took off my shoe and placed my foot in it and there was about a one inch area all the way around my foot in order to fill the indention--Something very heavy had to make these indention's--I tried and I am 300lbs and could not Except for the footsteps they were otherwise quiet The hair was long  Some of the tufts were over 10 feet off the ground tall and walked with it's head slightly bent forward, very dark in color My uncle told me I probably saw a bear but even I know a bear can't run on two legs The animal was across the creek at the beginning of the sounds and eventually jumped down into the creek, about a seven foot drop, and stayed there making grunts and heavy steps there for about five to ten minutes we seen a roughly 7' tall big ""something"" in the road just as our headlights hit it it threw something down and jumped into the woods The stride measured 3 feet from the toe of one foot to the heel of the next step  They were only around 10 feet away from her at that point - she on one side of the dirt road and they on the other I looked back but, it was really too dark to tell What changed my opinion of this sighting was a late night visit to a bigfoot website It's eyes glowed red in the dark, and all the sudden it runs straight at me, it was so fast, I mean it traveled about 30 or 40 yards in just a flash and then it stopped right at the edge of the road The thing was very large, dirty white, taller than the street sign that was near, and fury and I could tell it was not human or anything I had ever seen before, it scared me so bad I had tears in my eyes and started shaking and at that time I went straight home and told my husband about it. I saw it clearly crossing the road right in front of me, I'm 6'4"" so is my brother n law this creature was considerably taller than me probably 6'8"" shuffling like an orangutan but more human-like but not like a man It had to be at least 9 - 10 feet tall  It was hairy like a bear but had a human type face Even so, what they did while we were on Lookout Mountain would seem much like reported and researched bigfoot behavior At the end of January 2013 I was traveling north on Alabama Hwy 51 in northern Coffee County in a rural area approximately one mile south of the Dale County line just before dark As I approached a left curve I noticed a large dark mass in the road way We were within a couple miles from home when she spotted what she said was a very broad creature that stood on two legs and I became really excited when she said what stuck out to her the most was the figures cone shaped head and the way the hair shined when the lights hit it When asked about the height of the animal, he said it was at least six to seven feet tall I’m not convinced that what I saw should be reported to you but I do know that if it was a person I never want to see them again on a dark night in my yard because they are a very big person It was covered in hair, black to dark brown, and had an awful smell About a year before that My stepfather and I were hicking around the same lake,we liked to fish at a spillway way on the backside of the lake,and about 1/2 mile into the hike we crossed a fire brake about 20 feet wide, now keep in mind that we are a pretty good way back in the woods,we have crossed rocks thorns and bryers and all kinds of rough ground As i did I noticed something emerge from the swamp, next to and below the pasture fence about 50 feet, and wade into the water of the slew He commented that at this time he could also hear heavy breathing which seemed to coincide with each footfall My daughter didn’t really get a good of look at it she just seen something big zip across the road , but I seen it long enough to see it was standing up on two feet and really big and I guess what stands out to me the most is just how wide it’s upper body was  big enough to know that no other animal could even come close especially around here, and it’s height I’m just guessing but it seemed easily 8 feet   It was dark, and cloudy I guess because there was no moon or stars out My husband and I heard strange sounds for 2 nights in February 2023 and laughed about how they sounded like the Bigfoot sounds on television shows We continued to trail the animal's leavings when came across the same sounds of footsteps  She said that they were ""real hairy"" and completely covered in dark brownish black hair, that they looked sort of like gorillas but with human looking faces with hair on them, human looking hands, and human looking feet  I remember the hair was thin at his face, the base of his neck, and upper torso, but thicker around his beard, lower torso and legs Then your show comes to television and I go on your site today and learn that there was indeed a Bigfoot sighting on Ft We waited and waited and waited and all of a sudden an object - black - long - I would guess at least 9-10 feet, floated into our headlights and stopped  They proceded about 30 feet into the field like a horse galloping only on two legs, coming from a swampy area which was northeast of their location tall maybe 7ft.3""  His feet were bare It either frightened him to think it was a possible Bigfoot out there or he was embarassed to say he didn't know what it was The other was around six feet off the ground standing on the other side of the tree I stopped my car to go to the bathroom because I had to go bad and in the woods next to the road there was a horrible hairy man-like creature It moved across the road, it appeared, in 4 to 5 strides running. I played in the woods South of the Park and swam in the creek nearly every day.One afternoon just before dark I had been down near the creek at a small pond.This was before the City built sewer lagoon on that property It was about 8 feet tall and I could see its muscles in its legs moving and the whitish skin under the 3 inch black hair I awoke at 3am to the same grunts and heavy footsteps  One was, in her estimation, around 5 feet tall and the other was slightly shorter, around 4 feet tall  She said their noses were free of hair and that the color of their noses was dark brown or black, as were their feet and hands  Except for being covered in thick hair, their faces looked human with regular human-looking noses We found locks of hair in the trees, approx  I saw a tall hairy animal walking off into the woods (on two feet) from the road They were around 15 to 20 feet inside the wood line It just seemed really dark brown or black Once it got to the small clearing that I was in, I saw that is was a bigfoot  Mats of hair dangled from him in tatters We was walking through the woods in Tuskegee, Alabama in the Tuskegee National Forest going duck hunting, while we were walking we stopped for a quick minute to rest and i looked up and seen something flash before my eyes, as we got to our destination at the swamp  It's face was not totally covered with hair  After the initial 30 seconds he rocked for about 10-12 seconds then stood and stared at me --I was on the 6th floor about 120 yards away in decent lighting due to hotel lights and street light behind loading area of hotel-he then would stare back then he would remain face forward with feet only about 2 feet apart would lean over to his left with his right arm would start pulling bark off a very large pine tree--it looked as if someone were in a sawing position--then he would stand up stare at me then rock and then pull bark--this was done in that order 3 times over a 5-6 minute period--after five minutes of re-verifying what I was looking at I felt this creature was docile and smooth moving--I decided I would try and get a closer look--as I opened the sliding glass door he stared and I stared back--I ran out of the hotel room and there was security in our hall laying the morning news at the hotel room doors--I asked him to come with me and asked for back up since he had no gun--we ran around the corner outside - as we were running I Finally got the nerves to tell them what I saw--we get to the reference points I had chosen and there were a lot of fresh bark removed from the large pine tree--I tried to pull bark from it to no avail -- it was too hard--I am 6'4"" 300 lbs Its eyes glowed in the light like an animals It was covered with long white hair maybe 8 inches long, it wasn't thick but more stringy and dirty looking and it had a round head, not a dog My husband has described a hairy biped that has been seen by him on at least 2 occassions, and by his father on one occasion on Brindley Mountain in Morgan County Alabama After thinking for a moment he stated that his father is 6’ 4” and that this thing was bigger than his dad, making it closer to seven feet in height It had reddish brown hair As the creature reached the road and I saw it, it stood up on it's back legs up the hill I had the hair on my neck stand up and a feeling like I was being watched  I'd have to guess that the tree had about a 15 foot circumference - massive!  About 10 feet up the tree is a huge branch that went about 20 feet out over the river tall with arms that looked like they reached down past his knees It was more slender in build than the average ""Bigfoot"" we have seen portrayed in reports of sightings in the northern part of the US  It was definitely getting dark, but I could still see well enough to keep after the rocks for awhile longer The head was not huge and the body was pretty slender, it was probably as tall as the VW when it stood up, over 6 feet. I would say that the hills are a good 50 feet higher than the stream I SHINED MY LIGHT TOWARD WHAT I HAD SAW IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON AND SAW A CREATURE THAT TOOK THE SHAPE OF A HUMAN BUT WAS MUCH TALLER AND MUCH LARGER IN SIZE THAN A HUMAN It smelled awful, it had long arms and large dark hair covered hands  The creature stood 6-7ft tall and was staring directly back at me-it seemed to have fine hairs all over -grey color hair that got more black as the hair got closer to the skin--the tips of the hair were much lighter--the face (lips, eye lids, etc) were more of a very dark brown-it stood very erect, was very muscular, and did not seem to have the apelike protruding mouth and nose but more flat faced human like--after 30 seconds he started rocking back and forth--I then realized this was moving and could in no way be mistaken for a dear or bear or anything else--this was a fully erect apelike animal that seemed to want me see him --he was rocking back and forth from side to side Tall and was holding one of the baby pigs in its arms It was solid white and had long hair covering it's body  None of the meat was gone from any of them, other than what possums or coons had eaten, and most of them had broken legs She franticly explained to me what she saw when we got home and being the Bigfoot enthusiast I am jumped in my car and returned to the spot but didn't see anything. He described it as 8 feet tall, large, hairy, no neck, coal black eyes and covered in dark  brown or black hair  It was standing straight up on two legs, it was huge, at least 7ft tall, covered with medium brown hair It made the hair stand up on the back of our necks.But that is not all It was a bipedal creature approximately nine feet tall with a shoulder span approaching four feet with the most intense yellow-green eyes I've ever seen spaced six to eight inches apart The hair was dark and appeared longer and wavy looking on the arms and legs I walked ahead about 20 ft and said it might be a big rattle snake, about that time I heard leaves rustling and it got louder and a tree about 6 inches around shook back and forth about 2 feet each way and I heard the leaves moving like something was running away By the time we were finished feeding everything it was dark but I had decided to run a cord with a light on it out to the fence and work on it a while longer adding more clips to it  It smelled awful deader than dead my cousin hears something walking heavy, we turn around look down the logging road and see this thing step out of the treeline, it was a good 40 to 45 yards away it had dark brown hair, walked on two legs was very big 9 to 10 feet tall and it just stood there Its stride was wider than any humans I'm a christian and have NEVER, EVER, believed in bigfoot The most terrifying thing in my memory is this things huge eyes glaring at us  Longer than average arms and thick through the shoulders to the top of the neck (NAME REMOVED BY INVESTIGATOR) WOULD ALLOW YOU TO DIG UP THE CORPS TO SEE IF ITS HEAD IS MISSING, YOU MAY GET SOME CLUES OR EVEN SOME HAIR FORM THE SASQUATCH I don't know for a fact that what I heard was a big foot but I believe with everything inside me that it was  It scared the crap out of me, every hair on my body stood on end I myself have never seen a bigfoot  I realized for the first time that what I witnessed may not have been a crazy old shaggy man, but rather a bigfoot I heard a sound like trees moving then I heard nothing else so we were on our way out when we saw a very large footprint in the sandy creek bank and about to head down the trail in the dark I heard a tree knock not too far away The hair on my neck is standing on end as I type this It had short legs and a longer upper body we set up in some tall sage grass in the field behind my home about 300 meters away  My skin started crawling and the hair on the back of my neck and hands stood up  I could not see any facial features but they're arms were long for their bodies                                                                                              DATES: 1993-1996                                                                                                DESCRIPTION: APPROXIMATELY 7.5 FEET TALL WEIGHS 475 POUNDS, LARGE WELL DEFINED MUSCLES, VERY ATHLETIC, COLOR OFF WHITE I was going back to Birmingham  on interstate 59 exit 166 as I was going down the ramp to get on the interstate this is what I saw I cought something out of the corner of my eye and thought is was an owl but then I releaized that there was no branch there and when this thing looked at me I remember seeing to huge eyes  and it looked like it had it's arm leaning on a tree it was about 6 to 8 feet high and a dark color sort of a grey black blended in with the trees However, he was emphatic that what he saw was not a bear as he’s seen bears before and they are much #8220;narrower” than what he saw (He emphasized this by hunching his arms forward and dropping his shoulders to indicate how a bear would stand and then standing fully erect with his arms out from his sides in the stance that he said he observed the creature to be in.) It was tall, approx I kept my eyes focused on the woods where it walked into  We don't want to say this was a bigfoot but after watching a special on the history channel my mother and I agree that the similarities are enough to contact you and see what you think  It was tall enough that it hit or shoved aside some tree limbs that I have to jump to be able to touch We also found footprints in nearby rock quarry I had never heard of a blonde bigfoot but there it was  About ten minutes after their departure me and my friend started hearing strange grunts, foul smell, and heavy footsteps The face was ape like with dark brown-black leathery skin  It was standing as if frozen, I can still picture its arms and hands for some reason;  his hands were just like a man's except larger and covered with hair Right as it was starting to get dark I heard something coming through the woods and I thought it was a deer He kept them in a pin behind his house so when I get in front of the house I shine my light across the street at and around the house, suddenly I see something very large run from behind the house on two legs It seemed it didn't notice my car until it reached the side of the road when it was only feet away from the car About 7 years ago my wife and I were at a lake in the middle of the talledega national forrest in Alabama.The lake was sweet water lake.We were fishing in a small boat at the end of a slew early in the morning,we were the only ones at the lake, I think it was on a wendsday and we were all alone It was dark and probably around 9pm from the best I can remember So Terri (my wife) and I went back there the next afternoon to do our own Bigfoot research and also so I could further investigate some good deer sign (a lot of food for Bigfoot) and mark a few locations for future deer hunting I'm going back tomorrow to see if I can find any hair that may of caught the rail or any tracks, just anything that catches my eye seven to eight feet off the ground standing beside a tree  There would be no reason for a naked old man to wander that field, much less to be covered in grayish, white, shaggy tattered hair It appeared to be 8 to 10 feet tall, with reddish-brown looking hair One and a half steps, bout 8-10 feet..since then a lot more incidents bout like what I've described and there is always a rotten dead like odor Saw a deer run across the road, right behind it was covered in brownish black hair and was at least 7-8 ft tall huge upper body sorta narrow at the hips I can draw ya a pic of it The best way I can describe the creature’s expression is “stunned.” The face was covered in hair except for around the eyes He was unable to see any fingers on the hands although he did state that from what he could tell the hands appeared to be clenched and that the arms were longer than a human’s Just after we started downhill I began getting a funny feeling and the hairs started to rise on the back of my neck, like something was there and we were being watched We got there just before dark and had been there for several hours when it happened It looked hairy, and as if it were standing over the rail crossing it  Even then I thought that it looked like something had grabbed that deer by the back legs and beaten it to death against the trees I believe he was thinking he had real nut case on the phone crying, telling him how scared she was cause she heard a BIGFOOT in the woods behind her house I realized this thing was standing on two feet, and kinda hairy, but looked as if it were humanlike  I told her about how he had hair all over his body Details of Bigfoot is as follows, he was about 7ft He says he could not see anything out in the dark because of the glare of the dashboard lights (we had the radio on low) By the time we got into the truck we were treated to another hair curling scream still in the woods but getting close to the hayfield These footprints at first looked like that of foot gloves people that fit each toe like a glove does the hand  As I neared them, they appeared to be of various heights, about 2 feet or more, 3 feet and maybe 5 feet or more and all had brown black thick looking shaggy hair all over"
Alaska,"I've never been down there after dark again The arms were curled at it's side like someone with hands on handle bars  His fur or hair looked to be about 3 to 4 inches all over the main part of his body  Houses are on an average of about 100 to 200 feet apart with only the general area around and close to the homes cleared out  The person who was taking the report was sort of rolling his eyes through the whole thing as he seemed to be writing it down on a piece of scrap paper- We were walking about 30 to 45 minutes when my cousin thought he saw something standing in front of us about 100 feet or so away In shoe size it looked like it might have been like a size 13 or 15, There were 3 foot prints and about a minute later we ran for about ten minutes and we started walking and then we got to the road, about a mile away from the picnic area, where we were having a Mother's Day picnic  We started to race each other to the picnic area where our family members were  Some of the woods in the area are quite thick and in some places can’t be seen into more than about 10 or 15 feet  It continued to run away, jumped over a dead log covered in snow and disappeared into a group of trees and into the darkness The first thing I really saw was really bright blue eyes It was starting to get dark When I realized it might be a bigfoot, I freaked out and tore out of there Then I noticed how far up they were, the thing had to be about 8-9 feet tall  He was about 6 feet tall and looked to weigh about 200 lbs My daughter saw the feet....they were huge  This thing was walking upright like a man, long arms and what looked like a long neck from the side I called my partner but when turned back to look at it again it moved very quickly into the woods on two legs It was a large dark form legs spread apart, this is what led me to think it was a person on a bike Too big for a bear and the legs were too far apart  He was a tall, odd looking fellow and I joked to myself when I first saw him.  It had a fairly long gape in his walk..arms swinging with each stride Then we went over to where we thought the thing was and in the sand about an inch deep there was a footprint like a man's She described the ""thing"" to have been about 3-4 feet above the bottom of the window She described the footsteps as a sound that someone very large walking on two feet, kind of like a ""stomping"" When I went up to the house, my hair felt like it was standing on end, and I had goosebumps really bad  With one foot he pushed off with was more a normal running move, but the other foot he pushed off with propelled him upward (about a foot or less) and forward We were trying to make it to the camp sites near the glachier but it started getting too dark even for us  In one of the pictures that I took of this track, I placed my foot next to it on the ground, keep in mind I am wearing a size 13 boot On the way we had talked about unexplainable events or things such as bigfoot, and UFOs I am 5'4"" and my eyes just reach the bottom of the window, so I figure this ""thing"" must have been 7-8 feet tall It was rather dark, but there was light from the moon The rest of the thing was real dark, might have been black or dark brown I truly believe we have a Bigfoot in our area It was only about 10 to 12 feet in front of me  But I followed the tracks over the next small hill and as I came down the far side my headlight pointed right on the back of a bigfoot"
Alberta,
Arizona,"tall The bigfoot story came up and I had Chuck (who is now in his early 70's) tell the story without my interference to my wife and friends and he recalled the events of that day pretty much the same way I had been telling it for years I saw a very large and tall animal which was about the same redish brown color as a Herford cow, standing about halfway behind a large pine tree It was very dark and we were trying to start a fire but everything was wet and all we had was a dull ax to chop wood  It WAS a bigfoot It was very tall because the fence didn't even reach the top of its leg, and it was covered from head to toe in long brown hair that was all matted and had salt cedar branches tangled in it Monday night, Memorial Day PM, at 7:30 I went for a walk heading east on FR 124 to maybe see some elk before dark  It was getting close to dark and once again we heard this scream from the same general area of the forest below us We where driving to Winslow Arizona we where about thirty miles from Winslow in the area of Jacks Canyon when we noticed a seven foot creature hairy creature walking down the side of the highway  At first, I thought it might be a very large dog as it initially was coming up onto the road, but as it fully entered the highway, I could see that it stood straight up, to a height about as tall as a road sign, maybe 6 or 7 feet?  It had long, dark brown hair from top to bottom and stood absoulutely straight up, no slouch, no forward bending at all It was grey, 4'-5' tall, slender, fast moving, able to hide, and made a screeching noise twice, once when I think it hit something while moving and again, far away when tons of dogs were barking  when i turned them off I saw a hairy man like creature run across the road A few years later, my dad and my uncle had found a strange set of large bare foot tracks with what appeared to have claws in the mud near the same location I didnt think about bigfoots in Az. As an avid ""Finding Bigfoot"" watcher, our sighting was everything we heard/saw on the show As we continued to try and sleep we discussed what a long day it was and my roomate remarked I was so tired I thought I saw bigfoot And the foot steps stopped I was musing about the ending and just looking West across the CG when a very fast moving dark figure crossed the CG heading from North to South Just to mention I didn't get much sleep after that,     that night we came home and I put in one of my videos on bigfoot just to hear the audio on one of the recordings and we both just looked at echother like wow! too similar to discard the possibility I looked back over my right shoulder and about 120 yards away I saw this figure brownish black in color about 7 to 8 ft tall and very broad walking down in the wash  It was acclimated for the desert because his hair was very thin not thick like a bear Strawberry is located on the slope of the Mogollon Rim at an elevation of approximately 5000 feet I turned off my spot light and climbed into the tent and waited to hear the steps or see a flash light for it was too dark for human to see Immediately, I was very confused because I thought it looked like how a sasquach is described, but I didn't believe there might be any such thing as sasquach/bigfoot in Arizona of all places Although it was after dark, we were able to see him quite clearly in our headlights It crossed the road (2 lane black top) in maybe two full strides and kept going into a narrow canyon and beyond my sight Heading west on I-40 today at 0930 my wife and I saw a Bigfoot 100-150 yards from the hwy heading north You should have seen how fast it could run, and how long the stride's were, it was amazing When I got over a mile & a half or so from the highway a hundred yards or so from the lake I observed foot prints crossing the road deep in the forest heading south Seconds later we all heard a loud aggressive, violent, bellowing and deep throated sound that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up and made others run for their guns and others their trucks It was hard to judge the height of the creature because of the distance and shock but I knew it was tall And, I just shake my head, because one day, man is going to get the shock of its life, because this man/creature is out there, I know, I saw it with my own eyes We continued for a few more feet and we all then observed three large rocks thrown from the thick brush above are heads, about 20 yards in front of us over the creek to the opposite side The squatch had to have been at least 8 or 9 feet tall  So I did a web search on bigfoot and found this site and the recordings The eyes seemed to glow a bit green like a cat or dog in the headlights  The arms were long and hung down to the knees The small time frame in which I did see the creature walking depicted very similarly to the Patterson video this creature about 7-8' tall longer arm length reaching towards its mid thigh and walking with a very long stride and a hunch My sister, husband, son and their hound dog were in a tent 10 feet away and I could hear their dog whimpering I have looked into Bigfoot sightings before, but never connected it with Mt The arms seemed to be abnormally long...maybe to just above the knee  She screamed (Oh My God)!  It was clear to see a huge hairy (black & brown) furry being  Sometimes, I'm sitting around watching TV, and I see all the shows about whether Bigfoot is real or not He finally asked me to get out of the car and look for tracks or hair or solid evidence (once a cop always a cop) well on friday around 3 to 4 in the after noon i was fishing on the spilway.off the the east is a hicking trail that gose up the hill and around the lake..out of no where a bolder the size of a basket ball come flying thru the middle of the pine trees an 10 to 15 feet into the lake.well befor this happen u could hear birds cherping.well when is happen it got quiet quick..another guy saw what i did we bolth looked at 1 and other and he ended up leaveing I couldn't see its eyes, but it kept its head visible to look at me Was out for a run a couple of weeks ago and during my cool down I noticed what might be footprints in some dried mud Graham foothills headed towards Safford traveling about 15 mph Bigfoot is indeed real. IT RAN INTO THE FOREST, WE WERE STILL PARKED THERE PUZZLED, MOM GOES ""WHAT WAS THAT?"" I SAID I DON'T KNOW..THEN I GOT SCARED AND LOOKED AT MY MOM ,AND SAID, LETS GO, WE TURNED RIGHT THERE ON THE ROAD AND HEADED FOR HOME, WE DROVE BACK FAST AND BELIEVE ME, THIS PARTICULAR ROAD REQUIRES SLOW DRIVING, BUT NOT THAT AFTERNOON, WE GOT BACK TO THE HOUSE AND TOLD MY BROTHER...HE GOES, IT'S PROBABLY A SHEEPHERDER, I TOLD HIM A SHEEPHERDER WOULDN'T HAVE LONG HAIRY ARMS When I was awakened by loud foot steps Our friend was about seven feet tall and was covered head to toe in hair Me and and buddy were driving from my house to his house which was about 15 miles, it was around 2:30 in the morning and i was driving, he was half sleep in the other seat, about 5 miles from his house we were driving by the budweiser factory and i looked over on the right hand side of the road and saw something large and greyish  standing the side of the road staring at our vehicle as we came closer, when we were about 20 to 30 feet from it, it turned around and started running through the field at a fast pace, it scared the crapt out of us and my buddy started freaking out more than me, i know its something ive never seen before and i know it wasent someone dressed up in some crazy gorilla looking costume, this thing was large and had to be at least 7ft tall, it was hairy with laid down looking greyish hair with long arms almost down to its knees, if i had to guess it was a male and he looked around 500 to 600 pounds at least, i couldnt see its face really good but i saw his glowing eyes as we came closer to it with the headlights shinning on it, i told a couple people about it and my buddy doesent speak about it no more but its haunting having to see something like that on the side of the road starring at you I found a deer that had all been torn up another time the legs been ripped of and something had been eating just parts of it which was puzzling to me as I have seen lion and coyote kills From the distance I was, it would be hard to say how tall it was, but I would put it over 6 foot easily It wasn't particularly large, about six feet tall or so, but very solid for it's size and uniformly covered in dark brown hair  We were on a dirt road with tall embankments on either side NOTHING!! I could smell a slight smell of dirty feet and urine at the time. The hair on his arms was longer than the rest  The hair was short, about 3-4 inches long, and normal in distribution-it was not bushy I can only say, what I saw that day was a bigfoot.  But, it was so very odd that it certainly looked like it was ""walking"" on two legs  Because, this man creature we call Big Foot does in fact exist, I know because I saw one with my own eyes in the summer of 1977, in Arizona  He was covered in a light colored hair, similar to that of a camel in color I remember his arms swinging and he only looked forward Which was musky, wet smelly hair, undescribable scent I never saw its face full on, it had to be close to seven feet tall or more HE WANTED TO GO BACK DOWN THERE AND  LOOK FOR THAT PERSON, BUT I WAS SCARED AND SUN WAS ABOUT TO GO DOWN BEHIND THE MOUNTAIN, IT WOULD BE DARK SOON, I'M GOING DOWN THERE THAT EVENING, NO WAY In 1981 I came home from a successful deer hunting trip and was about 10-15 miles north of globe heading there when I came around the corner and there was a dark figure standing there about 10 yards off the road on my side It stepped out from the left side and walked across the road right in front of me, about 40 feet away or so, right at the edge of the bright part of my headlights, walking briskly but in no hurry crossing the road and slightly away from me at the same time so that it was probably 5 feet ahead when it reached the other side of the road  I don't know if what I saw was a juvenile BigFoot but whatever it was it seemed to disappear and the creature didn't seem to know I was there since it crossed about 100 yards in front of me, I was backed up off the road this went on the rest of our trip only from dusk to dark each night The steps sounded as though they where 20 feet away and leaving the camp sight About 40 miles north of Phoenix I went around a corner and saw what I thought was a bigfoot standing motionless on the side of the road I have camped in the old barn there and heard heavy footsteps about 2am in the morning, but didnt see anything in the morning cept for trampled grass Our headlights now shown into the area that the bigfoot could see them and it stopped as well  The habitat was a mixed conifer stand within a deep dark canyon The creature was dark brown and had longish hair  My friend joked when I got home that if was Bigfoot It's hard to explain, but it was like a big hairy man THAT (PERSON ) WAS STANDING  RIGHT NEXT TO A PINE TREE, TALL REDDISH BROWN, THAT (PERSON) WENT BEHIND A TREE AND STOOD THERE, SO I BACKED UP SOME MORE AND THEN THAT (PERSON) TURNED AND STARTED MOVING FAST AWAY FROM US INTO THE THICK BRUSHES, THATS WHEN MOM AND I, BOTH NOTICED THIS (PERSON) HAD LONG HAIRY ARMS BECAUSE WHEN IT TURNED AROUND, THE ARMS SPAN AROUND, IT WAS REDDISH BROWN  It was dark so I couldn't distinguish any other features. Another thing I must say is, other than a picture, foot prints, video, or a dead body, it is going to be very hard to prove this creature exist It stopped it's forward movement, looked around, and headed into the woods near the road in a couple of strides The creature appeared to have a reddish brown color to it a few shades darker than an orangutan As I got closer to the creature still thinking it was a large black bear I saw it stand up on its two hind legs and look towards me Hearing the scream together with the footprints in the sand I suppose equates to a bigfoot event I'm not sure but I know what I heard. Strawberry is only two miles away, but increases in elevation by 500 feet  It was around 7 feet tall The hair appeared coarse  They seemed to be coming from different locations within about a 50 foot radius The face was mostly hairless and looked...well without something else to compare it to kinda like a charactor from Planet of the Apes No bear, no deer not footstep sound It was very tall, large head and long arms, running on two feet toward our vehicle While in flagstaff, AZ, my husband, mother-in-law, and I decided to take a chairlift ride She heard slipper feet nearby the tent on the road  It didn't seem to pay us no mind as he crossed the road in only a few strides It must have been 7-8 ft tall He walked upright on two legs and had the gait of a human, as his arms swung in time with his steps Was out on one of my snowmobiles after we already got 3 feet of fresh powder on a boat launch road for Willow Springs Lake on the Mogollon rim above Payson, Az where your team is at right now on 3-8-12 in Payson Broad shoulders, wide body, and you could see the muscles in the arms, and its legs were very strong and muscular  I could tell that it was tall because it was above me, and tried to listen to identify it We saw the creature take two long strides through the trees and ""disappear"" To even hear the sound in real life made the hair on back of my neck stand up straight My biggest regret now is that I did not return the next day to look for footprints It was a very large Bigfoot I would estimate him to have been about 7 feet tall and to have weighted about 400 pounds  I just sat there in disbelief for a long time, and then realized what I just witnessed, a sighting of Big foot itself Then a few months or so go by and I was watching a show about bigfoot, on the show they played a recording taken by a hunter, as they played it, my wife comes from the kitchen, white as a ghost and says ""That's what I heard on Mt  The chewing stopped, the thing was gone without a sound, no footsteps I know what I saw, it was not a bear! It was large, dark and hairy We took of and i made a wide turn around the area that the Bigfoot had once stood  Long straggly dirty hair It was running on two legs along the fence just inside the trees with us Family called me back to the car, I glanced up behind me and there was something huge and dark partially behind a boulder right up the slope from me  It was taller than the sign by a head, making it about 8 feet tall It crossed the CG in a shaded area and blended well into its' background but the meadow beyond it to the West was bathed in afternoon Sunlight and backlit the dark figure Finally they left - it was now dark, we hung around for a bit but not long and heard nothing more Graham bigfoot We departed for Flagstaff soon after it had gotten dark The sound continued for about 2-3 hours or until just after dark What I saw, was a very large black hairy being that walked upright on two legs I had not noticed its legs or arm movement I turned back to camp and wondered about these two calls as I walked  I didn’t stop to listen again as it was getting dark and I wanted to get back to camp At the time I was trying to figure out what the hell I was looking at spaced 4 feet apart in 3 feet of fresh powder My first thought was, is that a bear?  Then as the thing kept coming up the embankment, I could see that it was walking on two feet, that's when my mind then asked, is that Gorilla? I remember it was dark tan in color, with long hair, you could also see it was very muscular, and it had these long flowing arms I had no knowledge of bigfoot in southern Arizona prior to looking it up a few days after getting home I could not believe what I was seeing walk down hill on two legs It was hairy and tall As we drove up snow bowl rd to reach the Arizona Snowbowl, we saw a large tall figure walking in long strides through the trees The previous night i had heard foot steps coming towards my tent  I always thought that bigfoot was a hoax Like many, I did not believe my eyes As we departed the area, Chuck saw large footprints in the sand of the San Pedro River, I am not sure how he did now see them before.. MYSELF AND A FRIEND LEFT FLAGSTAFF RIDING OUR HARLEYS FOR ONE LAST CAMP OUT BEFORE WINTER, RODE TO THE NORTH RIM AREA, WE EACH PITCHED OUR TENTS AND WE SAT AROUND THE FIRE TILL AROUND TEN PM, ABOUT 2:30 AM, WE WERE BOTH SUDDENLY AWAKENED FROM SCREAMS, I HAVE HUNTED AND FISHED ALL MY LIFE AND HAVE NEVER HEARD SUCH A THING, IT MADE YOUR HAIR STAND UP, THIS CONTINUED FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES, BEING A FAN OF THE SHOW FINDING BIG FOOT I KEPT THINKING ABOUT WHAT WE HEARD,  I GOT BACK HOME AND CHECKED YOUTUBE AND FOUND A COLLECTION OF SCREAMS RECORDED FROM AROUND  THE COUNTRY, AND HEARD ONE ALMOST THE SAME AS WE HEARD, PLUS ON YOUR WEB SITE THERE HAS BEEN ENCOUNTERS IN THE SAME AREA WE WERE IN. It was too far away to make out any features, but the way it walked, the posture, and dark brown/black color it was unmistakeable He never looked directly at us, but continued to look stright ahead and to maintain his stride across the lane It was bipedal and running dead at the road  At this time it was about sundown but it was still light enough to see, I noticed a creature which resembled a man but was covered in black hair, but unlike the BigFoot reports this creature was about average height and I estimated the weight to be about 200 lbs This was a highway that had many large rocks that could look like the creature if you were tired enough however this large object had eyes that reflected off my head lights  My husband does not believe in any of this, no bigfoot, ghosts, see contact info below. As we got closer my girlfriend said ""is that a bear?"" It was at that moment that it became visible that our companion on the road was covered head to toe in brown to light-brown fur (hair) The next morning after breakfast I took one of our dogs out for a walk in the direction the screams came from and saw nothing but about 200yard in the same direction I found what looked to be a possible shelter made from dead trees about 12 to 15 feet long and 4 to 5"" in diameter  It was standing next to a large diamond road sign that I believe is about 7 feet tall I believe the Earth depression and a row of large logs obscurred my view of its'legs as it passed by"
Arkansas,"It was either that or a baby bigfoot."" When the creature landed across the road there was some very tall grass for several feet and beyond that the train tracks and beyond that thousands of acres of farmland with several patches of woods everywhere  I saw only one right footprint as the snow was melting quickly  We saw no clothes on it and it appeared to be covered in brownish hair Location: 2334 River Mountain Road Delaware, AR 72835 35.309576, -93.375676 I saw a white Bigfoot in Arkansas, circa 1976-1977 I saw lots of deer tracks on either side of that hill but no footprints or track prints of anything but deer It caught sight of us and stared for 2-3 seconds, before turning and running into the trees still on two legs, where we quickly lost sight of it She described it as being 9-10 ft tall with stringy hair of varying shades of brown It almost acted as if my lights was hurting it's eyes and moving like it was old (like how old aged animals move slower) The animal had an eerie resemblance to a Bigfoot There was a ditch about 6 feet deep, and 7 feet wide and we took turns jumping it  Just past the curve I saw a tall, upright, black figure It was like a human but big and grey haired. He was covered from head to toe with a real dark hair and when my coonbuster coon light hit in the eyes his eyes glowed like a deer in a spotlight  I headed for the truck again wanting to break into the clearing before it got completely dark It had sticks and leaves matted in its thick reddish brown hair I came within approximately two feet of it with the front of my vehicle It had to be at least 8 feet, it appeared to be covered in fur or hair, and it had walked upright the entire time we watched it There is a street sign and a telephone pole across the road that when this thing passed showed to be about 8 ft tall in only a few seconds it was gone Ever since the first incident I have read and seen everything I could get my hands on concerning bigfoot  Sunday, October 16th, I went walking around the neighborhood road and discovered several sets of large and small barefootprints on the gray slate road in front of our house  Big eyes too I turn around to the pasture to try to see the commotion, but I heard the huge footsteps fading as fast as they got there What I saw was about 7 feet tall weighing about 300 to 350lbs running on two legs fast It was like hair not fur because it was thin and flowing in the wind unlike what fur would do I'm 100% positive I see & smelt Bigfoot  There was no smell and the eyes didn't glow red--just black shiny eyeballs  I would typically drive with my foot on the brake to get in there The only thing is didn’t seem to me to be like 6-7 ft tall, more like 5 ft but could of been the angle and distance, guessing 50 yds We had heard a few reports from others on the lake that summer of seeing large dark-colored animals  I was too startled to do anything but stay rooted to the spot and feel the hair stand up on the back of my neck; something which hasn't happened to me in years  On the opposite side of the river(west), was a tall stone bluff with a slight over crop from erosion At the time I had never heard of a Bigfoot with light colored hair and until I saw an episode of Finding Bigfoot where an eye whitness saw a white colored Bigfoot It had long hair on ""his"" body  But, as it approached, the heavy footfalls became obvious that it was not a deer I had a very eerie feeling and decided to get out of there and haven't been back there after dark since. It was about 8 feet high and long, ape like arms It was on 2 legs and taller that the cab of our full size pick up It is just sounds you can't describe, so we call it bigfoot sounds We are going back at first light to see if he left foot prints So all this bigfoot stuff is making me so excited to dicover the bigfoot and do my part in adding another unreported sighting, since i know theres got to be alot of them out there  He was standing on two legs, lots of fur and what I would assume Is at least 8 foot tall  It had long orangutan colored hair all over it  WHEN THE AUDIO WAS PLAYED I AGAIN BECAME AFRAID, SPEACHLESS, THE HAIR ON MY NECK STOOD UP AND MY EYES TEARED. I wish I would have stopped and thought to check for foot prints, but It really spooked me and the kids after I told them. I pulled the jeep up and shinned the headlights across the lake and he caught a glint of amber like eyes staring at us As I was down on my knee the Bigfoot stared at me as the bus started to move my sister and I looked out the back window and saw what I beleive to be big foot crossing the road  That being said, when I saw what I did in 1994 my first reaction was ""who's stupid enough to be out here at this time of night? They'll get run over.""  Then I realised that it was hair covered and TALL and probably not a man. Several friends and myself had gone together to purchase 120 acres of cut-over forest land that was totally surrounded by several thousand acres of timber company land I only ever told that friend about it, because I didn't know what it was and wondered if my eyes were playing a trick on me, because back then, no one ever heard of a white bigfoot, let alone realize that they come in all colors, similar to human hair Later on I was able to listen to some sound recordings of bigfoot and just as I thought, I got a rare chance to hear the real thing. We had things happen that we did not realize were possibly Bigfoot related He was huge, around 8 feet tall with black hair and eyes  This creature was least that tall, possible a little taller, but close to the same build I clearly saw that it was on two legs and had long fur as we went by My light reflected in it's eyes like an animal It was easily double the height of the fence, so I would say in the 8'-10' tall range  He thought it sounded like it was on two feet  In a flash my friend was standing back to back with me as we stared out into the dark As I got behind it, it was between nine and ten foot tall and three foot wide at shoulders It had red eyes and was of enormous size  It was at least 7 ft tall and black as a hog but had to weigh over 400 lbs  There was a shape on the ground that appeared to be a footprint When I turned and looked I could see a very large creature, about 7 to 8 feet tall with very broad shoulders, and could hear a sort of ""whoooop whoooop"" noise On the left side of the road under a big tree was a very tall - at least 8 feet - figure covered with hair from top to bottom  Something was walking through the woods, obviously on two legs It had rained the night before leaving the trail wet and it seemed that no one had been on the trail that day due to the lack of footprints And looking back on it now, the frame could have easily held 500- 600 pounds,the arms on it looked long, and they swayed back in forth heavily,i do not recall a odor,or anything like that,for this thing was out of my view in about id say 5 to 7 seconds At that time I rolled down my window, and realized it was only probably 25 feet from our truck, I said, go. I have mentally replayed the entire scenario many times and I have stood and looked at the same area where the creature was seen We arrived on the river in plenty of time to set-up the camp and have supper before it got dark I was standing about 10 feet down in the forest around a deep ravine not really too far from the house but it was right next to a patch of woods going back further south into the national forest Track was also right foot  Later that day, after my parents got home, I went up the hill with my dad to look for any evidence, but there was drought that year & the ground was so dry there were no footprints The next Day my older brother came over and we found Large footsteps in the road.  She also said that it had hair on it's body It was slender and not bulky like Patty from the Patterson-Gimlin footage  I tried to swing it around to get it on film but the footage was terrible A tall (7-8 feet) furry creature was observed walking (on two legs) across the highway, at the outer limits of the high beams on my car It was approximately three and a half to four foot tall He was hairy, walked kind of slumped, arms seemed to be long, everything you would think about Bigfoot And a Bigfoot crossed the road between us  Its stride resembled a trot or a jog Its  arms very long and I noticed that there was long hair hanging from his arms I really don't know what i photographed or whether or not what i photographed is really a footprint Then I knew I saw a Bigfoot that day We just sat there in the tall grass and watched the figure walk across the gravel road With only the dim, distant light, I could only make out that it was dark in color and I was unable to distinguish any facial features or hair length I'm telling you this because im learnig about bigfoot in our biology class at bentonville high school We were in a 16-foot boat a few yards off shore, trolling among the cypress trees in 8-10 feet of water for crappie using minnows as bait, using a quiet electric motor It lacked any detail in the gravel except that it had very definite, entire edges and was shaped like a human foot about 6 to 7 feet tall and had long arms At first I'm like ok it was a bear, but bears don't run that fast on 2 legs and it was too tall and too heavy to be a bear Since it was very cloudy and dark I ran inside for a flashlight, all the while wishing I had brought my rifle inside from the truck Night, dark clear, road traffic was light He must have been at least 8 or 9 ft tall THE BIGFOOT YELLED AT ME WITH A SOUND LIKE I HAVE NEVER HEARD BEFORE, I HAVE SEEN AND HEARD ALL KINDS OF ANIMALS We never saw anything though...Jonathon had been sawing down a small tree for more firewood when a loud whooping/moaning sound echoed just thirty feet behind us Human type eyes you could tell it was very smart because when I started screaming it immediately looked right at my house for other humans and got nervous I am 6'5"" tall and I can only see through the bottom of the window, that may give you an idea of his/her height I could see the ground between it's moving legs, and some vague image of arms, but not the head The footprints was 14 inches long and 8 inches wide and had onley three toes on each foot The road was at the least a foot higher than the ground and I was below his shoulder As I was feeding the dogs I noticed a large barefoot track measuring about 13.25 inches long and 5.5 inches at the widest part  and 4 inches at the instep I saw him first because I was using the high beam to scan the tree line and brush for eyes It was Between 7&8 feet tall, apeish like, but walked upright, long arms, crossed hwy in 3 to 4 steps, grey or dirty white hair, it looked at me but I don't remember seeing eye color, and the smell was awful (window was down) I didn't think to compare it to any tree branches to see how tall it was, but it was at least 6 to 7 feet tall I saw a large hairy apelike creature across the river flipping over stones and walking oddly heavy footsteps.  In other words, there was an inmpression leaving one field and then an impression (footprint?) in the middle of the road Soon it was dark and my brothers were across the road from the camp about 50 yards away fishing for catfish,they were my three older brothers I saw a large white hairy figure moving quickly through the brush  It took me a while to get to sleep that night knowing that a Bigfoot may be in the area. Now im about 5""9 and i guess the creek bed must have been 7 foot high,so i had my friend C hoist my foot up while i got my knee up high enough to pull myself up.Now the original plan was to yank him up once on top,but looking back on it now i realize how foolish this was because i would had to be extremely strong,because i probably could have just have barely have had touched his fingertips from way up there,but it didnt matter because what i saw when i got on my feet scared the crap out of me  I was alone along the tree line with my brush-thrashing guest in the dark  It was very, very tall, medium to dark gray, and just didn't seem like a person  He appeared to be 6-7 feet tall with black hair There is a small stretch, about 100 yards where they have made access for fishing, and the creature was almost to that point, which would put him straight across from us, about 75 feet away WHEN I GOT MORE ROCKS HITTING MY CAR AND AROUND ME FROM WHERE THE BIG BIGFOOT WENT IN TO THE WOODS  I was shape like a human footprint but with no arch, like someone flat footed I drove past it and was as close as 6 foot to it Hairs all over my body start going up and I'm praying that whatever it is isn't going to come out on top of this hill As our truck slowed due to the stopped traffic ahead of us, I saw something very dark in a crouched position behind the car directly in front of us During the daylight bright noon! I looked at the fence where they all jumped over and I found hairs but it looked to be mostly deer  By now it's right at sunset and the woods about 100 yards from the house are too dark to see into One Day we got on the subject i was telling him that i had bought a little book of ghost stories and bigfoot sightings and how i was very  itrested in bigfoot We did not have a camera or tape measure, but one set of tracks were 16-17 inches long and about 5 to 6 inches across at the ball of the foot  On the east side was flatter land with 12 to 20 foot thin scrub trees about 20 to 30 feet from the water, as the river was low Then I saw a very large, 18 inches or more, print looking very much like a foot right on the edge of the water a few feet away from the other prints I'm not one for tall tales but I thought I would share this terrifying ordeal with you all because it seems we might have something in common. with a half squeeky pitched voice, because in my heart was still in my throat,  I said ""Jim there's something in the woods! We need to warn the rest of the guys!"" Then came my next major surprise of the day, Jim asked me ""Is it real tall and white?"" I yelled ""YES, why in the Hell didn't you tell me about it?"" Jim said ""I didn't tell anyone about it, because I didn't want anyone thinking I'm crazy, or making fun of me!"" Then Jim proceeded to tell me about the time him and his nephew Pete saw the creature while squirrel hunting at Camp Robinson He said it was taking really big steps and apered to be 7-8 feet tall My brothers and mom were asking me questions and I never took my eyes off where I last saw it It was mostly dark in color, it did have some lighter spots on it It was very large and I could see that it was hairy  It was covered in long dark reddish brown hair all over, from head to toe It was then dark to where I could not see threw the trees anymore so I decited to get home It was after dark about 9:00 pm Then one foot began sliding, causing the animal to lose its balance for a second, nearly falling backwards, just before it stepped into the water There was a clearance of maybe 20 feet between the edge of the road and the woods when I noticed what I thought was a tree standing right beside the road I observed a hairy manlike creature approximately 8 foot tall walking away from me  At first, it was so tall that I thought it was the stump of a tree that had been struck by lighting, but as we passed it accelerating up the hill, it began to move She noticed it was bipedal with long arms swinging in the usual 'squatchy' way When I got down into the creek I noticied a small area of very small gravel about 5 by 10 feet on the edge of the creek and decided to look for animal tracks At the time I hadn't really thought much about Bigfoot since back when I was in junior high in the 1970's but after this have become really interested in it after this. I went on out in my yard about 10 feet and looked around I HONKED MY HORN, THEN A FEMALE BIGFOOT CAME OUT FROM BEHIND SOME TREES PICKED UP WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A BEAR BUT WAS A YOUNG BIGFOOT Its foot slid when it stepped off the road and onto the right-hand shoulder Well, that's my story and you can choose to believe me or not it makes no difference to me but I know what I saw and I can tell you that it's real, there really is some unknown bipedal creature or ape or whatever out there and we were just lucky enough to see one At first they thought it was a bear, but then saw that it was running on two legs like an ape or man  It was little if any longer than my boot, however much wider than my bare foot would be It's mouth went from a closed frown to rising it's upper lip and showing me what I considered it's meat eating teeth...I GOT THE MESSAGE !!! Then it's eyes squinted more at me, as if it was starting to get really pissed at me for being there I saw 2 bigfoots run to the left and 3 run to my right We watched the big foot movie and the legend of boggy creek in class He couldnt se the color because the sun was shining through the trees and big foot so you know it apeared as a shadow Around 1am or so, I noticed a dark shape to my right Saying it could have went eight to nine feet tall easily From what appeared to be the head to the ground was about 5.5 ft tall I got a clear look at it for just a second.Ill never forget what i saw that day.I remember its head, real long head,i guess you could say it was shaped like an egg, i just know it wasnt like a humans, the eyes must have been dark because i couldnt make them out,i didnt reall notice a nose ether, but there was so much hair, it was hard to make anything out except for the head.The biggest thing ill never forget is the height and weight of this thing.It was so big,legs coverd with hair, so massive,that had to have been the biggest part of this thing,so wide,had to have been as wide as a refrigerator.In comparing the legs to my legs i would have to say each leg made two sets of both of my legs.The shouldars were massive,could have been three feet or over from shoulder to shoulder.I also remember how it walked, besides taking extremely wide steps, it kind of walked with its front body slightly hunched over,i dont know, like some one with bad posture.The height of this thing was astronomical.The tip of its head was in the tree tops!!! now dont get me wrong, the trees werent that tall, but they were at least 8 to 9 feet where the limbs started to curl out and i remember the head was up there with them, there is no way i could have jumped and touched the limbs, they were just to high up.So i would put whatever it was that i seen to be 8 to 9 foot tall  Right outside of my mother's bedroom window was the most exact footprint THIS ONE WAS BIGGER ABOUT 9 FT TALL  I didnt hear it again after that but our kids never played outside close to dark after that either Saw a dark figure in deep brush, as i watch it moved into an open spot She said a few weeks earlier she and my uncle had gone to the same place we were going,and were fishing on the river when suddenly she saw a hairy face peering at her threw the bushes as she fished SHE WAS A DARK BROWN ABOUT 7 FT TALL THE BABY WAS DARK BLACK It looked big and hairy  I believe these were sounds from a Bigfoot The creature appeared to be around four feet in height may be slightly taller and was covered in reddish-brown hair all over that was about four to six inches in length I would estimate it was 7' to 7'5"" tall with dark brown hair with grey patches on the chest and face I thought it was a man at first until I realized it was totally covered in hair, medium chocolate brown in color What ever it was stood approximately 8 1/2 to 9 feet tall and we could see it swaying slightly from side to side  I WAS LISTENING TO ART BELL AND BIG FOOT WAS THE TOPIC AND SOMEBODY HAD AN AUDIO OF A BIG FOOT  It was so far away I couldnt say how big exactly but having seen a truck on the hill before it had to be at least 7 feet tall I came to a stop to watch it run into the woods, I was about 75 feet from where it disappeared I've had two possible bigfoot encounters My husband said it may have been a stick but I'm a country girl and I know my fish! His ""fur"" was longer than what bear fur would be and although he was dark brown it had a reddish hue to it, the headlights gave s good look at the color as it leaped across The animal was very large and had long gray/silver/black hair but mostly a dirty light gray The creature had long lanky legs, and they looked to be fairly muscular like it did a lot of walking and running I listened to the whoop and knock on that one recording and almost fell out of my chair It had a brownish- orange long fur over what I could see of it""s body and it's face was dark  It was 17 inches long and approximately 7 1/2 inches wide at the ball of the foot Again right at dark from the comfort of my pickup truck with a pistol in my hand THIS HAPPENED EARLY MORNING IN 2008, JANUARY I BELIEVE I SEEN A FAMILY OF BIGFOOTS It moved in long strides and very quickly As we all were loading into the truck my dad and older brothers found strange footprints near the truck where my mother saw the creature standing It was white and taller than the car  It was walking with a human like gait and swinging both arms and I estimated it to be seven feet tall This ""footprint"" was about 4 inches deep and full of water The creature was lean and somewhat muscular and it's arms seemed to be disproportionately long for its size  When I moved to DeQueen, Arkansas in 1987 I was told about a story of a ""wildman"" that some of the locals called this thing described as a big, hairy, wild man Me and my brother squatted down in tall grass next to the road I told him it was time to leave as the hair on the back of our necks stood up It had long arms, long like a humans, but not overly long, I would say its arms reached about mid thigh It appeared to have a moderately thick coat of black hair One thing she mentioned was noticing the muscles in the arms and legs Off to our right front side was a tennis court with 4 foot high chain link fence along the sides and 10 foot high chain link fence on each end  The animal came into full view about 100 feet in front of the vehicle headlights I was moving along the bank fishing and I was paying a whole bunch of attention to where I was placing my feet when all of a sudden there was a commotion in the woods about fifteen feet to the right of me I TURN TO SEE ANTHER BIGFOOT ABOUT 6 FT FROM MY CAR It was HUGE and had long, matted hair i showed the pics to several ortho doctors and 4 podiatrists (foot doctors)  It was early morning so it was still dark and I saw it in the headlights of my jeep before they came down he lokked over across the dirt road on the other side of the hill on the tree line where the evevning sun was shining through the trees and seen the big foot walking It did not have any clothing and seemed to be covered in short dirty white hairs It looked at me like it was studying me and when I started to scream it neared it's mouth open at me and it's human like eyes was darting around my house It wasn't until I was 12 or 13 that I came across that bigfoot movie that's real popular This was back before I had ever even heard of ""bigfoot"" and so I had no knowledge that such a creature even existed Their was a window next to the bed and as I looked to see if some one was there I noticed a Bigfoot staring at me through the top pane of the window  We sat there in our chairs until sunrise with no further activities at the time I didnt know about big foot so we thought it was a ape that had excape from a carnival The raccoon tracks intersected with two sets of human like footprints which had come from a nearby wood line  About one mile (34.173758 -91.072666)  south of the White River NWR Pumping Station I saw an ape like human form walking upright and tilted slightly forward at a brisk pace up the right (east) side of the levy emerging up from tall grass I am writing this because i think that i might have had a recent  experience with a bigfoot It didn't make sence, I wasn't throwing anything at him, I was pulling my pants back up when I was hit with a stick about an inch in diameter and about a foot long that was freshly ""twisted"" off of a tree It was tall maybe close to 7 feet and was thinner than I would have expected it to be Back in 1969 when I was twelve years old my mother and oldest brother saw a creature while we were camping that changed our whole outlook concerning Bigfoot We trained the light on its eyes and as we scanned down the tree, we saw what looked like a very large man leaning very still against the tree While south bound on US71, 8 miles north of the Ouachita River, observed a very tall, dark-colored, upright, bipedal creature crossing the highway and disappearing into the forest. It was too far up in the trees to be a deer or a coy dog and the eyes were too big to be an oppossum or coon It did not take us long at all and before no time the kayaks were loaded and all that was left were our chairs, water bottles and the lighted perimeter  It was too dark to see, but he at first assumed it was a deer or maybe a bear  The hair was similar to that of those long haired cows all over the body but still was able to see muscles under the hair very similar to a gorilla I could make out fur on the outline of the shape it looked like it was about 8 feet tall Then I noticed that instead of walking on all 4 legs, it walked like a human, upright  I remember seeing the arms swinging and the two legs moving  About 50 yards below me was a large, dark colored creature walking on 2 legs following a fence row The feet were long, my guess they may have been 15 to 18 inches or so, but they seemed accurately proportioned for a creature of it's height I bow-hunt in Camp Robinson from time to time, and as God is my witness, the hairs still stand up on my neck when it's dark and gets too quiet in the woods After this time had passed I wanted to see more, so I tried to step out of the bed really soft and when I did the rug that was on the hardwood floor slipped and I lost my footing  The large print is about 3 inches wider than my husbands foot and he's a big man. I don't know what it was for sure but I think it was a Bigfoot. I turned at looked at my son's dad with a “what the heck?” look on my face and his eyes were huge ""IT"" was a very tall creature walking on it's hind feet like a man, but with a stride that seemed to be about 6 feet per stride Then he told me that he seen bigfoot before and he told me the whole story It had hazel yellowish eyes The creature was about 8 or 9 feet tall, and stopped right in the middle of the trail, and then turned to face me  When we got in, I told her that I saw ""something that didn't appear to be human but was running upright.""  It appeared to be dark brown or black in color and looked to be covered in hair  I could see the big black eyes shining in the moonlight and the head Walked and ran on two legs this happened in west memphis ark at the foot of 8th street landing"" Talking about the hair on the back of your neck standing up, I was scared I had a hair standing on the back of my neck suspicion that it might be about to make a fish-hook loop like an injured bear, and then suddenly pop up right beside me on the trail It had a flattened face, and big rather dense bone on the arms and legs Technicals: [[Matt Moneymaker's note: To see the location in Google Earth simply copy and paste these coordinates into the Search box 35.309576, -93.375676 then click the Search button.]] [Witness:] Google Earth tells me the distance was 700', though it felt like it was about a football field An adolescent bigfoot ran out of the woods and into my aunts yard it ran between the house and the garage But when we ran the light through the trees, we caught the glare from its eyes looking right at us It appeared to have arms which were hanging at his side I remember seeing it’s arms in front of it as if it was moving branches away to protect its face and its hands were black i saw eyes shining in the headlites and thought it must be an owl or something in the tree but as i got closer the ""tree"" walked off into the swamp i never saw anything so weird as i went by the  place it had been something screemed load enough i could hear it over the sound of the truck with the windows closed and i sure wasn't going back to see what it was. It didn't help that only one or two people since then truly believe that I saw a BigFoot  It was covered in black hair except on its face and had as I remember a  flattened nose and pointed head I got the 22 out of the tent and Chris got the light and shined it into the wood's and about 25 yard's from us we saw a very tall man standing there beside a tree as soon as the light hit his area, he ducked behind the tree but we noticed with the light he was huge, around 7 foot tall at least and was wearing what reminded me of a gillie suite that hunters wear, all covered with a redish brown fur it was about 7'5"" tall deep brown color, had hair from nose down, the face was deep wrinkled and the eyes had no whites, they were colored kind of In the crouched position it was taller than the hood of my truck  It didn't take long for it to travel across the road and continue West down into the tall grass on the left side of the levee and disappear I was looking over all the damaged trees that were still down from the Ice storm we had in this area during christmas.As I came near boggy creek it was getting somewhat dark, so I decited to turn around and head back home  There are woods on both sides of this road with a tall chain link fence surrounding the woods on both sides It was very tall, and lanky and was a dirty white albino color at the time i saw this i was driving an 18 wheeler on highway 71 south of fouke ark near the crossing of the sulpher river going north at around 1 am the headlights of my rig picked out what i thought wat a dead tree trunk about 6ft or so tall off the right side of the road next to the water I know in my heart that it was a bigfoot  Some logging had been done, and some of the pine trees were growing back and were 8 to 10 feet tall Long arms very muscular  I was looking at the trees while my uncle was getting something when I noticed a large bipedal figure leaning against one of the trees  It was taller than the truck that was in front of me, later as I caught up to the truck I found out t was a full size Chevy 1500 The creature and I looked at each other for what seemed like an eternity, then it made a snarling expression and squinted it's eyes at me I took one quick look down and figured i would break every bone in my legs if i were to jump,for the water was only maybe a foot deep, with all this happening in what i would say just about 2 seconds,and keep in mind i havent even been able to warn my friend yet of what i thought to be a charging bear, i look back to see this thing or whatever it was walking extremely fast! It was then i noticed that this couldnt have been a bear I walk about 50 feet, not quite out of sight of my friend when this HUGE, tall hairy creature was kneeling When i got to my feet i was facing nothing but dense forests or woods,somthing caught the corner of my eye about lets say 75 to 100 yards off By now, it was well after dark and without my headlamp I could not see 3 foot in front of me It's face covered with leathery looking skin with hair  Thats when I heard the footsteps  At first I thought it was a childs footprint until I looked closer  We were staring into the undergrowth looking for the source of the sounds when a dark, but more or less human-shaped figure appeared between the foliage, 2-3 feet from the water's edge It also had brown wavy furr but other than that I never got a look at it as it apparently fled before I could lay eyes on it she and my mother got together and along with my brother they compared what each other had seen, it was white in color red glowing eyes and had a pointed head  The Bigfoot was upright on two legs and was brownish, grayish in color From what I could tell its face was dark too, as if there was some hair on its face We agreed it was on its hind legs, it was brown, it was a lot bigger than us and it was fast As we passed the spot where the creature crossed the road, we saw saw a 7-8 foot creature with semi-shiny, reddish brown fur standing at the side of the road; it was semi-concealed by some branches. We were on a double lane highway in south eastern AR when I saw a tall, large, greyish haired creature standing on his legs, run across the highway about 300 feet in front of my van The arms were lanky and long and swung slightly as it walked, and it's hands hung down about knee level It was a large animal or man at least 7 feet tall tearing across the road When I noticed something on the tracks at that cross-over, I noticed that it ""appeared"" to be another foot taller The creatures stride still amazed me, it's single walking stride from one foot to the other was probably 4 times my stride  It had long arms, long legs, a neck and head  The trees where I saw this thing were 9 and 10  feet tall It was getting so dark out that I could no longer see thru my peep sight We also found what looked like a foot print near the area of the sound but we could not really identify it...It was bigger than my foot though and I wear size 13s.  Also, during this run, I could hear thumping footsteps as if someone were wearing heavy boots  Mark remembers a grayish splotch of fur on the chest, but otherwise, the fur was dark brown in color, longish but not dangling, and it had red eyes I was more stunned than scared at this point, but my eyes were watering and I did feel strangely sad suddenly, and I had backed all the way up to the door  It was walking on two legs the moon was out but with all the heavy trees near both sides of the road it was to dark to see more than twenty feet infront of me ,when suddenly my hair stood up all over me,I turned around fast and ran back to the camp  I looked at my friend, who seemed to realize this at about the same time, and I said, ""That's not a squirrel (which is what I had thought it to be at first)."" We both rose and turned when suddenly my friend grabbed me and yelled ""Look at that!""  I followed his direction and could distinctly see the arm and leg of something tall and hairy standing behind a tree Right in the middle was a cell phone so my husband picked it up and It have been chewed on by dogs are coyotes or something so he laid it up on the tin  which was about 4 feet away  It appeared to be covered in black hair and stood upright, facing us Just over a fence that was about 5 yards from me, I noticed what I thought might be a bear up on two legs It was tall and big as far as I could see Then he leaned forward and put his knuckles on the pavement and swung his hips through his arms and was now on the far side of the east shoulder I asked him if he’s ever seen a bear run like that on it’s hind legs, or a deer or elk that dark running that smooth, he said no  What I saw was a tall reddish looking creature cross the road behind me about 20 yards  I don't know what it was that I saw, but I'm sure that it was at least a foot taller than my 5'8"" and it looked massive, like a giant hairy man with long arms and long hair all over it's body, and the fastest moving thing I've ever seen or heard You could see the profile of a head, shoulders, back, buttocks, legs and arms swinging wide One morning I was on my way to work and as I was coming close to where Fairmount road was I could see something by the bridge at first I thought it was a coyote or large dog scratching around the bridge with its back legs as I got closer I realized it was not and that it was a sasquatch, it was a reddish-brown color, I could see its face area had almost no hair and the skin tone was lighter than the rest of it It was around 11 pm and as we started to leave, I noticed a dark figure standing next to the 10 foot tall section of the chain link fence the summer of 1998 i was driving between heavner oklahome and mena, arkansas ..approximately  2 am ..i popped over a hill and a tall lanky hairy figure..apporximately 7 to 9 ft.ran across the highway in front of my vehicle..it was very clear in my headlights..very long arms and legs..slender with long hair on upper and lower parts of its body..i am absolutely sure it was not a bear and it was too tall and fast to be a human... At the most he was 25 to 30 feet away from me. His hair covered every inch of his body except for his face which was slightly less hairy around the eyes and forhead But I believe what I saw to be a bigfoot or sasquatch.  I looked up and saw a really tall man in what I thought was an old fashioned sweat suit with the hood up how would they know we were coming?3.how do you account for the height and size, it was easily a foot taller than any human ive ever seen.It was so tall,you cant duplicate that kind of height.Ihope someone reads this and takes it seriously because i dont know if ill ever go into the woods again. We come back the next day drove back to the powerline and the cell phone was gone and they're in the dead grass area laid a piece of pipe  about 2 foot long so we picked up the pipe and put it on the tin  and we left All of this didn't take 10 minutes from the first few deer that flew out of the woods, to the stampede to the elephant sounding footsteps  It appeared that whatever was making the noises was only about 10 feet inside the brush yet I could not see what it was  It must have been 7-8 feet tall  I saw a creature, about 15 yards away, standing upright about 4 to 5 feet tall on the left side of the road I looked out to my left and saw this very tall white thing walking tall. We were trolling along the bank and at about 9 am along an area that opened up from the trees to a rocky area that was a power line clearing when we seen a Bigfoot like creature walking upright over fairly big rocks towards the power line The two large one went right over the fence to my left with very little extra effort, like a large high stride So I started kicking the ball around that chair playing soccer in my head with this big red ball I later figured out that the barbwire fence that ran around that whole area was 4' tall As my luck goes, we were at a point where the road was hairpin curves with no shoulders and no way to turn around Around 1999, I came across some articles online about bigfoot, and when I read the descriptions, my blood ran cold  We hear sounds out here almost nightly of what we describe as big foot sounds but I've honestly never thought they was out here it took long strides crossing the road and was not leaning over on its hands to walk It was no bear or anything that had 4 legs It wasn't too far from my face and looked me right in the eyes I heard 2 HEAVY footsteps in the woods quite close to the road I never saw its face or hands but the hair seemed silvery white, similar in shades to aluminum foil I know in my heart that what I saw was a bigfoot, and no one could ever convince me othwerise. we started toward the woods in pitch dark without flashlights and as we got half way to the woods this god awful scream came out of no where When I woke there was a big dark figure in the window The eyes were close together, and were very focused on me...I would describe them as definately being predator's eyes I was driving around the backroads of fouke and the jonesville area, it was a saturday late evening just before dark  I did notice the tree limb the creature walked under, that was only a foot from its head, but was too high for me to reach, at least 9'. Our two tents were set up about 20 feet from the tree line with the tents only being about 12 feet apart Yet there they were cowardly crouched behind my legs whimpering The year was 1964, this was in Lee County Arkansas,  we lived on 164 acre farm at the time .I was 11 years old, I was playing outside in the front yard about 2 in the afternoon, I looked up and seen something walking up the road ,It was very tall and had long wavy hair, and it was going from side too side looking in the ditches as if it was searching for something, I screamed for my mom too come and look, She and my older sister came out, They jumped in the car too drive and get a closer look, but it ran into the woods It was getting dark when I had a rock thrown over my head which freaked me out so I quickly turned around and lifted my shotgun and light and look up and down the tree line until I came up on a big oak and I saw what looked like a Sasquatch looking at me from behind the oak and it yelled at me with a low grunt and high pitch scream so I jumped and actually took a shot and hit the tree and it took off running back down the line towards a valley."
British Columbia,
California," I turned to my passenger to relate to her what I saw, slowed down some more, but when I looked again to point out the bigfoot, all I saw was Joshua trees and desert It had just grown dark by the time we were about five miles outside of Paso Robles still in San Luis Obispo County on Highway 46 heading toward Shandon, and had just passed a lone farmhouse to our left when I had to pull to a quick stop It was dark, roughly 930 or 10pm They sounded similar to sounds I have heard on bigfoot recordings, and very much like nothing I had ever heard before, very loud, and very erie Once I was clear of the door I brought up my pistol and fired into a dead tree a few feet away from what I thought was a big black bear My friend is about 6 foot tall and jumped in the water to see about how deep it was Being much older now, I wish I would have gone back for proof, foot prints or something. We did not see any thing but more foot prints and a smaller version of the foot print. I saw large reddish brown eyes, a large brown head and a dull black (not shiny) area that would have been the nose Heard from someone in town there that BF's have a way of sort of mentally 'fear-paralyzing' animals; this sort of explains why I tried to turn myself into a tall thin stick when I was sitting there It could not have been more than twenty to thirty feet away again We put all of our sleeping gear and firearms in the tent and lied down, and were talking for about ten minutes, when we heard the first grunt outside the tent When it stood up my mind went blank and I took my foot off the excelorator, we had a vary good long look at him maybe about 15-20 seconds it felt like forever I had left my backpack leaning against a log about 15 feet from our tent He turned his light on and shined his light about all of three feet but there was no one there but he could hear it walking away again This heavy, bipedal thing was coming closer and closer and was about to come to the point where I had pulled my truck off the road my friend then told me that he had seen it, again before i could even ask above us i saw it, there standing no more then i would say 25 yards up the hill, was a the creature i believe to be a bigfoot  It was dark and about 6:00 with a mod He gave me a general location of where it could be found and what trails to take to get there, but when most of the area is large (football field size) sheets of granite, the trails are only marked with stacks of rocks and they are few and far between It ran on two legs but dragged and pulled with its arms It raised up to a full standing position, I would say 7 or 8 ft tall, dark brownish hair It made the hair on the back of my neck stand on end to recognize it  The encounter happened one evening just before dark, as the sun was just going down over the hill  All we were doing was walking through the woods several hundred yards from the cabin when we saw what looked like a conical-shaped head, brown in color with deep set eyes peering at us from behind a tree approx.100-120 feet away slightly uphill from where we were standing  It was bigger than a bear; besides bears can't walk on thier rear-legs for that long. What I saw when we played it back made the hair stand up on the back of my neck This thing didn't have glowing eyes, and I had the high beams on and watched it cross the road and look at me Well I have collected enough information from various bigfoot sites about screams to conclude that I heard a sasquatch on a bicycle touring trip from Portland, OR to Santa Barbara, CA in the summer of 1981 We have a secluded spot we always return to on the bank of a 10-15 foot wide, 4-5 feet deep (at the deepest) river The prints, described as 14 to 15 inches in length, were spotted this morning near the area where Sunday night reports placed a grotesque 10-foot-tall man and repeated shrieking noises  The rocks were angular, about 2 to 3 feet long, and the biggest of them may have weighed a couple hundred pounds  The breeze was blowing straight from the brush behind me and I felt the hair on my neck starting to rise up After maybe 5 seconds, it stood up on 2 legs  Once we arrived at where it was standing, there was a footprint in the dirt that made my footprint look like a child's footprint But then we turned a corner and I saw the footprint from about 50ft away!  I was so amazed that I stopped my truck and got out and immediately took off my shoe and sock to compare sizes..  It was easy to see and make out the animal's face and eyes They seemed to be dark brown This barking was silenced by a yell that I've only heard on documentaries about bigfoot, but it is totally different live It made the sound three times, so I made a mad cat fighting sound, and it was then that I heard the foot steps leave my yard and I know that it was human steps and not animal sounding steps The footprints led right into a thicket and I could see it was a wide path left by whatever it was  It seemed to me that it would have been a very painful experience for any human to walk those rocks barefoot  His feet bottoms were flipping TOUGH (I'll spell it TUFF) because they were Wide and what I would describe as Padded We all wanted to camp in a bigfoot area, so we we went to a campground near Bluff Creek  She then told me that her people believed that the bigfoot was sacred and that they lived at the area we had saw the bigfoot and that they help to carry their dead through this mountain to the other side  He/She was about 7 1/2 foot tall and very dark colored long hair It was about ten to twelve feet away and looked right at us The first thing that I thought was that it looked like a big foot, but was hesitant to suggest that to my wife I couldn't make out any genitalia it was so hairy I would estimate its body hair like six inches long and matted and dangly, but not so much on its butt or the back of its legs It was 3:45 a.m when we heard footsteps walking up the trail towards us I don't know what that was, I won't argue for Bigfoot, nor any other animal  When my dad drove closer to the stump later on, he realized that by the height of the stump and the height of the man or man-like creature, that it would have had to be much larger and taller than any normal man A few weeks to a month later, I remember seeing in the Bakersfield Californian an article that a bigfoot was spotted in the Shirley Meadows Campground I recalled this was an attribute of bigfoot track trails, having read this in Dr Then I noticed it had big muscular arms and huge hands  Its hair was black, and cut off about even with the upper neck It looked massive, like 8 to 8 1/2 foot tall and at least 3 1/2 to 4 feet wide About a month later my son was able to view the Bigfoot video and when he heard the screams he said, Dad thats exactly what we heard  Her eyes were still clear and there were no flies or maggots on or in the carcass To my right, this person (I say person because it was two footed by the sound of it) was no more than 10 feet from me I watched your program on bigfoot tonight and that day became so real again because the film you showed was our boogieman The road went down to a creek.We went down to the creek and on our way back, we pushed our bikes back up the road because it was steep.The road goes up along side a canyon,and was old asphalt turned light gray and crumbling.We were maybe a third of the way back up.It was quiet ,then suddenly a crashing breaking sound came from across the canyon.There was something running like a man,covered in dark hair, face humanoid ,right towards us, down the other side of the canyon.It was breaking small trees about 1 to 2 1/2 inches in dia That's when I saw half a foot print in the snow The night of my second day out, I slept on this nice marble ledge, beside a small creek about 2 feet wide that was more of an ice drainage from the steep, glacial peak above The screams stopped, but we could hear what sounded like heavy footsteps right outside the door to our tent The hair was much shorter and thinner around the butt got longer and thicker as it went up its back I noticed what appeared to a man walking up the hill about 20 feet in front of me It was about 30 feet up the hill from us I also took photos and videos of the prints and with my foot next to them Unfortunately, I never got eyes on it so I can’t give you a visual account  After a while I had fallen asleep, and awoke the next morning to find that my family had already moved the houseboat out of the cove as I slept, so I didn't get to go back to investigate the footprints again Our fear was emphasized by the fact that his large male dog was frozen in fear, fixed on one area in the darkness I remember noticing it had big reddish brown eyes that seemed to stare right through me It was over 8' Tall..., I am 6'2"" and played Basketball since 4th grade even against 7' players in high school (I was a Leaper and could jump really high- I was 6' when I was 12- stopping my growth @ 15 years old @ 6'2"") Sir, A good friend of mine and I were camping up on the Kern Plateau, a massive area 7,000 feet-plus in elevation on the western flank of the Sierra Nevada above the Kern River in late October 1985, (Peppermint Springs Campground is closest location) Our friend's husband rolled down the window leaned out and screamed, ""What the hell just walked in front of my car?"" What I saw was about 9 or 10 feet tall, covered in dark (like black or dark brown) hair, long arms ( longer then a normal mans) its face was like every picture i have ever seen and it walked down towards the river and up into the woods He was walking with a purposeful stride, and didn’t take very many steps to cross in front of us Their was a full moon so it wasn't to dark to see that it was a pretty big creature  It had a shell with an 8 foot bed and it was used by a retired couple to tow their trailer so it is kind of slow We continued hiking to our destination for a while when I started hearing a crackling of branches to my left about 50 feet behind me, maybe less Up until that point in my life, Bigfoot stories were like the Loch Ness Monster: something intrigueing that you sort of wanted to believe in but could never be sure about But we locked eyes and stared at each other motionless, it had dark eyes I could not see any white, I could see the hair on its head blowing slightly in the breeze, I didn’t see any facial hair just a very dark skin face like an ape, after looking at each other for about a minute I wanted to get closer but the fallen tree was in my way so I took a step to my left to go around and when I got out of its site I heard it get up and bound through the trees making the same noise as it ran away from me the loud expulsion of air and breaking branches as it ran off.  The rear of the tent was a few feet from a slope consisting of huge boulders and small pines His hair was black maybe dark brown, and yes his eyes glowed by light! The first thing we both thought was bigfoot, but neither of us agreed  Looking over the sights of the little carbine, I observed this being to be about 7 or 8 feet tall, with well-muscled, long hairy arms hanging down to the waist I heard a very strange, and very eery (stand your hair on end) kind of ""howl"" After finding the footprint I proceeded to the area where the tree(s) was where it darted into I was scarred stiff, but knew that I was downwind of bigfoot and he apparrently did not see me It was totally dark, I knew there was no one around for miles and I also knew that bears do not go rampaging around throwing things i said it looks like a small bigfoot print, because of the heel, and ball of the foot and a strange toe pattern  I could not tell what sex it was because of all the long, dark hair around the body It walked like it knew a car was coming, because it went up the side embankment of about 12 to 15 feet tall and weighing about 400 to 500 lbs The closet person was about 1000 feet away from me He was about 7' tall and had a slender body like a basketball player with big strong shoulders, and a real skinny waist  I knew it was Bigfoot (Sasquatch) and wanted to see his face but, I was too close still to maneuver around and go the other way and the turn was too shallow  I instantly knew where I had heard such an unfamiliar call....about 3 years ago when watching a Bigfoot reality show, where these squatch hunters were making this strange/unique call while searching for Bigfoot It was still really dark out, and the forest was ink black outside of the car light I was bathed in We wanted to be alone, away from a formal camping area as we had firearms and planned on doing some ""plinking""  She showed me a trail that went way out into the woods where there was a small stream (only a few feet wide) with a big rock I was at least 500'away and I'm not real good at judging height anyways, so I don't know how tall it was  The creature was hunched over a bit, so it's hard to tell exactly how tall it was, or if it was a juvenile  It came down the hill about fifty feet to the left of where the two hunters had just gone up No man could lift there leg that high or step that far! No man!!!  Nowhere did we see bear tracks and even if we did, they don't walk that far on 2 legs  It walked hunched over with his arms at a dead hang as he walked The Bigfoot just looked at us for a few moments  Long arms, thick legs We pulled up and backed into to the same spot as before to notice that one of the green trash bins had been pushed over towards the lake, and that there was a 2 foot wide 4 inch deep circular dent like something big had punched it I rounded a sharp corner to the left going downhill when my highbeams hit a large animal on the left side of the road, it was standing on two legs and was facing to the left That night, just as the sun set and darkness was beginning to fall, Craig and I were walking in the direction of the main road The creature was oriented so that I could see the entire left side from head to leg to about one foot from the ground When I came to the path I immediately saw large foot prints, they were very deep in the mud and about 14 or 15 inches in length SHRIEKING MONSTER A horror tale of a 10-foot-tall man led sheriff's deputies last night into a dark brushy area adjoining Peter Pam subdivision, west of Cold Springs When he was about 50 yards away we both at the same time realized we were not watching a man, but this was a Bigfoot! He walks like a man, but he was not a man I saw what could only be described as a bigfoot several years ago on route to Kennedy Meadows  I mean from the centerline on its right leg it jumped clear off the pavement and over a two foot embankment and was out of sight He heard the heavy footsteps and again it stopped at his tent then walked around it I realized I could hear him splashing in the creek, and peered into the darkness, and saw the form running upstream into the back country As we approached the creature did turn his head to look at us, the face was dark, humanoidish like, it's eyes where planted firmly in front and not to the side, also the creature seem to like growl at us because it did show us his teeth When they got close, I asked them if they ever heard of bigfoot When we reached the spot where we saw this thing, we noticed that the tree branches that were damaged were four to five feet off the ground I had a full moon though and the area is surrounded with stark white granite slabs, and so except in the darkest of the woods, I could see pretty clearly  By the time we arrived it was already dark and we hurried to set up camp for the night It seemed very man like, covered in two to three inch hair that was red brown on the legs  As I said, I caught a fleeting glimpse of part of something dark We saw ""bigfoot"" about 4 am in Shasta County, CA while driving on 299West The branch it was on had broken about a foot's length from the trunk of the tree, the branch there was at least 4 to 6 inches in diameter This animal had to reach the 8-10 foot range at least and brutally strong  As we got closer, I noticed that the creature was on all fours, the upper part [thoracic] seemed to arch and it was higher, than the rear part [postural], the fur was dark but seemed to shine with the headlights, the head itself did seem to be round in a way with the exception that the occipital area seemed to be more pointy It had big eyes that looked yellow ( from the head lights would reflect off an animal?) I drive a 2001 Jeep Cherokee it was a lot bigger (taller) than my Jeep 4x4  As an Eagle scout and an athelete (I was recruited to play footbal at Cal) I wanted to impress my friend who loved the outdoors  We thought that they were bears running on their hind legs like trained animals would do I would also say that this creature was around 7 to 8 foot in height, and about 500lbs, or more in weight.  The light of day was almost totally gone I did catch that the arms were quite long and they were very big in the chest, shoulders and upper arms, not so much in the hips When I was very young I saw a pair of Bigfoot tracks with my father He had no clothes on whatsoever, and the bigfoot’s body was covered with about 2"" of hair with a few bald spots showing skin He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business  It got somewhat darker to a browner as it went up its back  Once back in my sleeping bag I stayed awake listening, when I heard two foot steps behind us on the rocks of the dried creek bed I could see a dark mass about 4 1/2 feet tall, right at the edge of the tree line, 6 feet from my head  As the bigfoot became almost even with me across canyon, it disappeared into the manzanita, about 80 yards away I’m very serious, because I've studied the Sasquatch or Bigfoot ever since, and would go with someone else today and be a lot more prepared for such an venture, but never again alone like that night and without some serious protection I have often heard of big foot and thought possible not likely  It had seemed odd to me that someone would have been barefoot this far into the woods  As he was cutting across the woods, about 100 feet from the bus stop and 20 feet off the pavement, he jumped up onto a stump Even circus bears have an ungainly walk when trying to go on 2 legs  It was then that I put the footprints and scream together in my head May 12, 2001:  new broken trees, dozens of fresh footprints, and two nests are found  The next morning we got up and I checked for foot prints around the camp fire were I cleared everything within five feet but saw nothing  We all wondered if it was a response to the Big Foot calls that the guys had been making Every few hundred feet it would roll or throw a huge rock down the hill along side the trail It was just starting to get dark between 8:30pm - 8:45pm ""I checked my watch after the incident."" I felt the urge to put my cordless spotlite on and look to my right down the concrete runway giving it a quick glance my urge told me to look to the left into the trees, that is when I saw a pair of the biggest red eyes glowing back at me that I have ever seen They must have driven several miles, because all was quiet until I looked up towards the top of the ridge behind me and to my right (towards Donner Lake) and saw a tall (between 8 and 9 feet tall) apelike creature, sandy brown in color, rather lean and especially gracefull in stride, walking smoothly and rapidly down the top of the ridge towards the utility road, crossing the road aboat 40 yards from where I sat on top of the boulder (which was about 8 feet tall), with a loaded 30-30 rifle across my lap We hiked in and at the marshy part I told him to go in the direction that the deer ran to and I would try to spook them out again I waited for him to get out of site then I walked toward the pine trees, I got to the pines trees when I seen three does running in my direction toward the grove of trees in front of me, just before they got to the trees I heard the same noise again the expulsion of air and a branch break it spooked the deer two of them ran downhill and the last one ran uphill right at me it stopped within ten feet of me but it never seen me it was so frazzled by what it saw it stopped slowly turned around and tried to see around the tree to what had spooked it  They often found footprints, heard moans, grunts, snarls, snorts, tooth-popping and chest-beating At 200 yards I watched 2 bigfoot for 10 minutes just walking around within 25 feet of each other by the edge of a deep canyon I looked to see what she was talking about and I saw a very large hairy creature walking across a wide, dried up creekbed.There were no trees or anything blocking my view 6-7 foot tall before ducking down behind brush, ovalish head, Reddish/Dark brown fur, I seen the sulight shining off of it's shoulders which were as big as a linebackers with full gear, amber/brown eyes, flat faced, long hair matted, and big ass eyes staring straight through me, I was crippled in fear until the adrenaline started to kick in, and I ran, and jumped down the hill which was about 8 feet above the road, ran into my car, told my friend who was with me by the river, to get into the car now, we need to go, and I didn't stop until I got home, and out of the woods  He walked swinging his harms down near his knees but above them and up right, not hunched over like an ape..., he was walking but just massive- those Shoulders Then I remembered hearing on one of the sound recordings off of this website and how there was sort of a whistle at the end of the recording from bigfoot so I started trying to imitate the whistle  My next thought was, “His arms are down to his knees!” Lastly, I thought he was trim, with broad shoulders like Michael Phelps  It was suppose to have actual footage of a real Big foot Hairy, with long hanging brown to black hair And when it looked at the car its eyes were red It turned and looked right at the car and I got a very good look at it and realized it was a Bigfoot  The creek bed was a few feet wide and the tent was a dozen feet from it  Whatever it was, was standing right in front of the opening but because it was dark, all we could see were hairy legs  After I briefly looked away and I turned back, the eyes were gone I had never known or heard of big foot or sasquatch at this time in my life  Of course, I really never did totally forget about seeing a Sasquatch!  It was only later on in life, after getting married, serving in the military, and leaving California for Florida, that this sighting began to trouble my conscious By this time we both began to believe that we had heard several bigfoots communicating with each other but really had no way to prove it One of them was a good foot taller than the other What was that?"" That's when I told him I think we just heard bigfoot I came to this website and read about the sightings in the Sugar Pine area and heard the Bigfoot screams I took a break to rest from my fast strides and looked out over the meadow I then described three different gait patterns by example and she picked the long stride and lumbering type verses the noraml human gait or small steps Head to knee, the figure was a uniformly dark hue and no other detail was discernable, except that the shoulders were slightly more narrow than the average person would be, and the height was at least 6'-3"" to 6'-5""  There was a car coming toward us so this thing huge in stature turned both directions allowing us to see it was on two legs, then it leaned forward with a bolt of speed  I had heard of the legend of Bigfoot, but I always thought that it was just that, a legend About 5-10 minutes later, we climbed back up the hill and onto the trail only to find some footprints I listened and peered into the dark spaces of the forest hoping for some more audio or visual information, but it never came It was late in the day and the sun was down but it wasn't dark yet, only dusk If it were people playing a prank, they must be extremely dedicated to risk their lives negotiating that hill in the dark and rain and to wait in the woods any given night for the off-chance campers might come by in November; 4  The one I saw didn't and it looked taller, too, so I'm guessing it must have been a male  I then heard foot steps come directly twords our tent and stop right in front of the tent  At first, I just thought it was a deer or other animal, but then it dawned on me that the eyes were at least six to seven feet off the ground  While running accross a talus field in a remote area of the western Clark range, I came across pits in the talus where granite blocks had been lifted up and stacked in neat piles about 3 or 4 feet high  The area where the eyes were was in total darkness and I do not know if the firelight could reach that far in order to cause the eyes to reflect red  Small trees were just broken off about 4 feet from the ground as the thing made its retreat. There was mud where the water crossed the trail and there was a giant foot print in the middle of it  This track was wider still than the first, and looked similar to typical casts of Bigfoot prints They were made by a man like biped creature, the stride was longer than mine are, but I could stretch my stride to match the stride The light did not penetrate the darkness beyond the nearest trunks  We rolled out our sleeping bags on the bank, the river at our feet and the steep cliff to our heads These prints made my foot look childish  In my heart I believe it was either a person or a bigfoot The Deputy Sheriff from Pinecrest reported hundreds of 15 inch tracks with a 5 foot stride in Leland Meadow, a popluar recreation area I was surprised to see to these trees moving because they are thick in width and very tall As we all looked down we notice there were large footprints in the sand along the river and leading to the east, uphill toward the forest edge We had just gotten back to the car when I looked back at the treeline we had just came out of a, sort of, for a last glance, I will miss you, type of look, and I saw what I first thought was a black bear in the very top (the literal tip) of a 60-70 foot pine tree, it was staying still but I could see it was wiggling a little, almost like it was positioning itself comfortably, and it looked like it was hugging the tree like a bear It was after dark My memory of the details of this part is fading as the years go by, but I remember thinking that I was leaning towards thinking it was very faint eyeshine based on intervals and shifting positions I looked down to see if there was a fence between us, and there was not any fence at all ! My mouth was watering over fear and I could not move my legs I was stunned as I overhead Bart Cutino talking to my cousin about bigfoot as he was walking out the door  Unfortunately, the Dinty Moore stew can exploded and sprayed food all over them and a 13-foot diameter circle around the fire (this is important to what happened later) The south fork of the Kern River runs thru--it It has lots of deer, bear, cougars, fish and now bigfoot. We’re no stranger to Bigfoot stories here in the PNW, but this time was a strange one for sure. It was a Big Foot. Its forehead was gunpowder gray with the temple area being purple red down the side of the face partway then dark tan My husband was standing next to my chair finishing his food when I heard what sounded to me like a teenage boy hoots and hollers coming from below us like on the highway  The cat had jumped on it and immediatly arched her back hair on end and screeched like pinky toe on the side of the foot  I would estimate the bigfoot to be about 7' tall.  It looked like the heal of a human foot only this one was about 8 inches wide  It was loud enough to hear over the noise of the creek five feet away  Then I became more aware of my surroundings in relation to bigfoot The next day we went into strawberry to get a couple of things and found that bigfoots have been seen around there quite a few times. I was down at deep creek near Lake Arrowhead, Ca and I spotted something moving, very tall, standing atop a huge boulder about a mile away  The stride varied from four feet to six feet in length  I couldn't sink my own track at all! I mean no inches, nada!  So now I was thinking about a homeless person wearing animal skins with huge feet and that was significantly heavier than me.. Thats how I left it untill one day a few years ago I picked up ""The Bigfoot Case History Book"", and while paging through it, suddenly there was the picture of what I saw so many years ago Then I looked down and saw big feet A chunk of big foot poop the size of a golf ball On the way back to the camp, he told me that he was only 10 or 15 feet away from it  It had the imprints of all five toes and the rest of a perfect foot print right back to the heel  The resulting pits in the talus were maybe 5 feet deep small human foot print with pinky toe on the side of the foot  I would estimate it to have been about six foot six inches tall I was and am still convinced that what I saw was a bigfoot Next we heard leaves move about fifty feet over from the last sound I was listening to Art Bell last night and they where talking about bigfoot....Art played a couple of clips of bigfoot sounds taken I think in Oregon or Washington  This thing was massive and I would imagine it was at least eight feet tall We were going fast and quiet, when I slowed down for a muddy spot so as not to lose control, I noticed to my right just behind a redwood tree a figure that was about the same color of the tree bark, dark brown I did a little look-up on my computer and found information on bigfoot It happened very fast, but what I saw looked covered in brown hair from head to toe and was huge, walking just like a man  We eventually tied the ""fisherman"" crossing the river the day before, below the dam, to maybe not being a human but a Big Foot Tonight me and my husband were driving on Hwy 50 and we noticed a 8 to 10 foot hairy creature on the side of the road just standing there looking at us while we were driving home.. Some time in the night, probably 1-4 AM, my girlfriend woke me up saying she heard someone jumping into the river about 50 feet away, and it sounded like the person's legs were sloshing against the water the way it would sound if you were walking fast through thigh-deep water While riding our bike just after sundown my dogs started going crazy, I looked at my dogs and saw that the hair on their backs was straight up  Since our road is a graveled one lane road they must have been within a couple of feet from eachother! He told me it had just happened so we went to investigate No other footprints human or otherwise around.  about 50 yards beyond that is a rather steep dirt ledge that goes up maybe another 25 feet above where we were sitting  There arms hung down almost to the ground This bridge is about 60 feet long, a suspension bridge, about 15 feet wide They were barefoot and looked just like human feet Sitting Around The Fire At Night, The Subject Of Bigfoot Came Up We have had various incidents over the past few years since 1998-2004 including 3 sightings, one amazing vocalization occasion, wood knocking, and one footprint I've been interested in the bigfoot phenomenon for more than 30 years, so I had tears in my eyes as I paid close attention to this almost indescribable sound It was starting to get dark, the wind was virtually calm, and it was so quiet and peaceful that I could clearly hear occasional sounds from camp about 100 yards away: talking and the clinking of cookware Once I finished my time there I walked in the trees for twenty feet and then I moved out of the trees and back in the open In summer of 2009, I believe I saw something that to me, was a Bigfoot  I payed close attention to the steep clay roadsides, and once noticed what could have been a partial footprint of a large, humanlike foot from the heel (about 4"" in width) to a point about 6"" forward (and perceivably midway along the length of the foot We thought it was a hiker but it was not quite walking like a man (judging the long strides by the bench, we could not walk like that comfortley) and how easily it moved across the snow At that time we didn't even think that it may be a bigfoot  He told me there was some guys on the news who had found a dead big foot back east The foot print was as long as my boot, 13” long plus the toes and 2” wider than my boot on the side What I did see was a pair of big deep footprints going away from our site down into a deeply wooded ravine  It covered at least a couple hundred feet in what seemed like 2 or 3 seconds and was gone It had two long legs and only took two strides to cross the street It looked to be about seven maybe eight feet tall, covered with long shaggy brown hair and kind of teetering back and forth on it's two feet I helped him look for tracks but only found some deer tracks about 30 feet away I had great eyesight then and still have it now  The branches or trunks were being pushed back and forth crossing over each other by a good four feet and again, violently being shook  It's whole body was dark brown, like it was covered with fur I had been sitting in a folding chair reading for a couple of hours when I heard a very large branch snap  I collected hair samples ""Wow!"" My head was trying to compute, ""animal on top of a trash can, or a big animal on the ground, that eave is at least 8 feet from the ground..."" It wasn't making sense, but the moment didn't last long Its legs where long, and this was NO BEAR! Now here you are going to have to trust me  Its legs appeared to be very muscular and I was impressed by the ease in which it ran--its movement reminded me of a tiger, strong and graceful, although he ran on two legs like a human After checking your site, I find I am in error! After the trip, and having just watched the special on Discovery Channel (?) I checked out your site and some of the recorded vocalizations -- they were enough to put the hair up on the back of my neck; very close to what we heard I decided to wait until daylight before I confused myself anymore in the darkness  She said that he was very big and very hairy I walked up the same trail bigfoot walked up, and found a steer skull laying in the trail The other guy still calls Ruben every other Christmas to wish him a good holiday and always ends his conversation with “Ruben, do you think that the thing we heard when we went camping was a Bigfoot?” Ruben always replies, “I don't know, we never saw it  I was not thinking about a bigfoot, it didn't really cross my mind until a couple of years later actually.. It was very tall with dark hair I thought maybe it was a man, but why is a man running through my camp on a dark, moonless night? My girlfriend was asleep so she didn't hear They Went Back Out To The Hut And XXX Began To Film The Hut, With His Son Going In Through The Doorway, And Out Through The Back Doorway, When His Son Said, ""Dad, There He Is"" XXX Turned Around And Saw A Tall ""Creature"" On The Adjacent Ridge, With Arms That Hung Down By It's Knees, Moving From Side To Side It had yellow eyes and was walking away The next morning there were no footprints or other evidence. It was dark and it really spooked us Then I listened to monkey and bigfoot sounds and the only thing that came close was a Black Howler monkey It was huge, at least 6 feet tall and quiet We still dont know what it was, but we are about 90% sure it was Bigfoot. There were no signs that anyone had been there for a long time, no garbage in the empty can or even footprints in the snow i was about one hundred feet from were they were When you see them you say yourself, ""Those are bigfoot tracks."" The first sets of tracks were HUGE, and thee times as big as my fathers feet, and he is about 6' 3"" with a good sized foot  However, now that I have seen numerous showings of the Patterson film in which “Pattie” was documented, I must guesstimate it was male in gender?  Within 10-15 seconds, as quickly as the creature had entered my field of view, it calmly made about two strides across the open fire lane, parted some tall bushes with well-muscled, uplifted hairy arms, and disappeared into the thick bushes We decided to pack up and high-tail it out of there, leaving right at dark I am not a person who is prone to believing in conspiracy theories, alien abductions and bizarre events such as a purported Bigfoot sighting It was that profound of an experience, the kind of episode where the hair on the back of one's neck stands straight up A bit later, still before dark, I got up and kindled the fire a bit outside and decided to take my vehicle up the road to drop some trash off near the campground office I was not about to tell anyone I saw a 7 foot (or so) tall hairy man creature in the campsite We both wanted to believe we had heard a Bigfoot but really had nothing to compare it to until we heard the screams on the Discovery Channel video tape  But there were two problems to this obvious bigfoot sighting (in hindsight).. The distance between us was about fifty feet We rushed in the dark to pick up everything an soon was making our way down the mountain to get home I was shocked into reconsidering my expanation a few weeks later when road crews cleared the brush away revealing that the brush was growing on a drop off that was 5 feet lower than the road, making the brush 8 feet tall  the hair looked like it could have been 18 inches long, very shagy  It stood two feet taller than the men we had just seen We asked them what that noise was and they asked us if we had seen the thing run by our campsite ....we were too scared to notice I guess...We watched your special on cable this morning and when they played the vocalizations of what is beleived to be a Bigfoot  I got scared all over again this many years later As I was crossing over a bridge which crossed over a ravine with a river through it I looked down into the ravine and saw what looked like (about 7 to 8 foot tall) broad shouldered possibly male, all black from head to toe form stepping from the tree line on the west bank approx We couldn't ses any detail of its face but its whole body looked dark brown to black  I returned to the area the following day, but it had rained and I could not locate any footprints, too muddy I saw that it was hairy and had a reddish, orange, brown multicolor mix hair to it, and most different was a rear end that was bare like a monkey's My judgment  was very clear at the time of the sighting and so what I think it was is a very intelligent creature with tremendous speed and strength running like a man and covered in dark hair from head to toe The hair coming down the arm from shoulder to elbow was red and 2” long i can tell you , i will never forget what he looked like, and have came to my own conclusions, i believe the smell the bigfoot emits can be used as sort of a defense system, let me explain, i believe when excited or scared the aroma he emits can actually work on a persons system, maybe for one, it makes you feel drugged, or for another it makes you feel hypnotized or just plain scared I had no idea what could have done that to a big steel trash bin and for years until Google Earth Mapping of Bigfoot They were heading down the path that I had followed the day before, some of the foot prints were on top of the ones that I had left the day before Hair longer on top and shorter around the sides with no hair from lower forehead to mouth This was from perhaps 100 feet away, I quickly walked up to the stump, but there was no one there I think it was early September of 1997 when I received an email from Matt Moneymaker asking if I would be interested in investigating a possible recent “bigfoot hotspot” in northern California Also, unless a human was walking a mile from the road barefoot through rough terrain, so it couldn't have been human My girlfriends' aunt and uncle were sleeping inside a camper trailer about 50 feet away from us and they said they heard it pretty clear They were VERY tall and very upright I didn't know what I saw until a year or so later when I saw a picture of the famous movie footage  Then, I googled Bigfoot howls My wife has had Laser surgery on her eyes, and I wear corrective lenses, which, most unfortunately I wasn't wearing at that moment Bigfoot foraging for rodents?  Quien sabe?  This was definately not trail construction, as it was in a very obscure area without tourist acsess,  but why waste time lifting boulders in the middle of nowhere? As far as my credibility goes,  I grew up in an ""outdoors family.""  I lived in the park about 5 years and got around quite a bit  I would say from the volume of the noise, the critter that produced it was, maybe no more than 100 to 200 feet away A huge figure about 200 feet away from me was watching me and the dogs The second set of footprints was the same size as mine Footprints were ""square""-almost all toes were of equal length,ie: flat across the top  I could readily discern the huge dark shape, as it stood there for possibly a minute or so look, you can even see the toe prints! This creature has to be at least 7 feet tall!"" We looked at each other The creek was about 2 feet deep and swirled softly, chuckling between and over the rocks The arms were almost the length of half its body and was covered in hair  Our camp was on the edge of a North/South ridge; with the mule being due north of us, and a very steep drop-off only about 100 feet was due east This creature was covered with long dark brown hair except for its face and region around its belly button, and it was obvious that it was a boy  A little way in and I started hearing the footsteps again As it moved it partially turned its head/torso towards me and made a ""huff"" noise, arms swinging as it crossed the thirty feet in about four strides, turning away from us  It looked very tall with big long arms The angle I had only allowed me to see the legs It was completely dark by the time we finished cooking I decided to spend the evening on a high mountain ridge so I would not have to climb the mountain in the dark the next morning  We had fished until dark and it must have been about 9:30 or 10:30PM I had a sheath knife, but standing to fight seemed out of the question: it was dark, this thing was big, and I was petrified It was late and it was a boring uneventful dark drive up this ""Bigfoot Highway 96”, but finally we crossed a bridge on the Klamath River and got to a campground where we finally saw trailers and trucks and people type stuff At 9:17AM I began shooting VHS video footage of our trek, and after a short period of time we finally decided to leave because of the wind and cold These prints were 4 inches deep!! They were also, 2 to3 inches longer than my foot and much wider I have heard that Bigfoot often times will mark their territory or paths that they travel on. They were big huge prints! The measurements are 52"" inch strides, with indication of toe's at the end, and hair like lines throughout the bottom  This creature was completely covered in long dark, brown hair, from head to feet and appeared to have a huge, barrel chest I hiked in the afternoon before and pitched my tent just before dark Tracks were found that were 22 inches in length and had a five-foot stride He had jet black, shiny fur, with a reddish color around where his eyes were  We both then realized that whatever had hit the camper had to be at least five feet tall and could not have been a deer running blindly in the dark It was all black, long arms (longer than ours), tall, muscular, and slim with no neck visible He had dark, long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build My friend shined his light along the treeline and seen some eyes low at the tree line The water was about 5 feet below me, and only filled about 10 feet across the bottom  As I contemplate the incident today, I realize now that this was a Bigfoot!  And, it had both seen and heard me  As we all know our minds are very capable of quickly assessing what our eyes see - or at least attempting to It was built against the side off a hill where you could walk into it from the trail but when you looked out the window off the main room it was about a forty-foot drop [it was partially on stilts] to the ground I suppose I ought to be since I have held an avid interest in this subject for years, but there is a whacking big difference between sitting safely in your home reading about this stuff on the net, and listening to something make funky noises in the dark woods of a forest Let me say this..I cannot say the reddish brown was hair The ground under her window was packed hard clay and there was no foot prints or anything. The scream originated from a location approximately 75-100 yards northwest and approximately 50 feet lower in elevation of our position As I still stood there facing the river, some movement caught my eye and I turned my eyes toward the movement I've lived in the woods my whole life and think nothing of walking around in the dark with out a flashlight I am a serious bigfoot believer and visit the BFRO site often I turned off the truck engine and left the headlights on as I saw so many pine cones about an foot or longer and I began to load a few up and walked towards the trail, the brush to the right of it parted and out stepped this huge figure, like a man but taller [we are both 6 feet tall] and wider  At first we thought it was a bear but when it walked in front of the car we realized that it was not a bear but a bigfoot. The howling, and the sight of that animal could not have been a human, and if it were then he had some massive eyes with big contacts to make them glow like that His eyes glowed in the dark, and he took a step closer We then looked over this fence and threw a gate and seen these huge foot print's and smelled something like a dog that's been wet and rotten egg's mixed About 20 feet from shore I see what I initially believed to be a big hairy head with eyes staring directly at me By now it was dusk, and we decided we had better pitch our tent before it got too dark The crashing sounds stopped and soon there was the sound of footsteps coming up the slope directly toward us Footprints were found in soft fine silt overbank deposits on a meander of the creek and were approximately 11 inches long I saw a perfect foot print in the soft dust I stopped, dropped my bike and ran the twenty feet to the edge of the road, by this time it was running fast, with the unmistakeable sound of two feet treading on Tanbark Oak leaves I had never heard of bigfoot at the time, and did not become aware of other sightings until several years later. I know what I saw, it wasn't a bear or cougar, they don't walk on their hind legs  My father was also very interested in the tracks, he asked me please not to walk near or in them, then asked me to sit down while he spent several minutes comparing his foot size to them, and trying to match thier spacing by walking next to them I finally came out and walked to them and looked into the trees and thick brush only to see broken brush, twigs and some hair there The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human I stopped completely and not over one hundred feet in front of me was this thing intent on getting across the road the road in front of me 10PM in the northern desert above Palm Springs, CA., and saw a huge light tan colored biped with soft blowing hair .Because I was in a small VW bug with the light pointing down into the street upon leaving the driveway facing out into the desert  The caller refused to give his name on grounds, ""You'll think I'm crazy and put me in a strait jacket."" He reported seeing a man - at least nine or 10 feet tall - in the road by an old gravel pit north of the Peter Pam tract  Although we did see another camper about 200-300 feet away, I can't imagine why someone would be walking across the creek at that time of night. For me, the matter of Bigfoot's existence was resolved that night 25 years ago I walked back to the point were I saw it squatted and it had left a single, dark brown and black stool on the path  When I saw the footage,  I got those same chills all over again It was a hairy thing sitting down against a tree with it's back towards me  I’ve seen the show “Finding Bigfoot” and know what sounds sasquatches reportedly make, but I never thought I would actually hear them. It looked human, but it was larger than any human foot print But when I got home I started to look up Bigfoot sounds YouTube and I found that exact one I'm confident that it was not a bear because they generally don't take very long strides when they stand on two feet  I was looking for a bear or eye shine  I got one single eyeshine about 7 or 8 ft off the ground when I panned back it was gone  He just slowly backed up the hill, keeping his eyes on the creature and when he got to the pavement, ran home I wish we'd seen something that night, but I never did even equate it with bigfoot until a year or two ago I was sleeping parallel to the little brook running along the Marble Ledge and about 15 feet from its banks But now the treeline is 50 feet away and not 6  I didn't know that this could be a Bigfoot until just last week end, when I found out that I was going to be camping this summer at Smith River (I heard that the most recent sighting was 8 months ago) What I saw was two dark hairy creatures just standing there under the food bag like they were negotiating how to get it down or something They were just huge! The smaller one was probably just a head taller than my dad  Hairy, muscular legs, and just huge The sound of the breathing was at least seven feet up in the air about 8 foot tall, covered in a reddish brown, and some what black hair, the face i remember it looking almost humanoid in appearance I did notice that it crossed the road in, I would say 3 strides The path has become almost non-existent due to fallen trees, branches and almost no foot traffic  I watched the bigfoot as he came nearer, to try and figure out what it was It was dark and everybody else was sleeping It’s hair was a chocolate brown and very course  It had to have been taller than 6 foot, and the window, if I remember correctly, was off the ground 3? feet and the window itself was 4? feet tall We stayed up late and slept in shifts at the campground and did not hear from the Bigfoot again The second day was a long hike to Fleming Lake (elevation about 9600 feet,) where we made camp just before sunset About 300 feet up the road from the car, I saw this thing walking across the road Today, August 23, 2007, I was hiking off-trail in El Dorado County, California in the forest 60 feet north of the Bryan Meadow trail, when at about 10:30 a.m  I also noted as it walked, its legs at the knees were bent as it walked its legs never straightened out like a humans legs would very similar to recordings I have heard of supposed bigfoot calls  Like something was timing it's footfalls so as to not be detected In the morning, we saw some footprints by our tent that were about 12-16 inches long The head is too large and the arms are too long My wife wants to see a bigfoot I then asked her what color was his skin and she answered that she could not tell because he was covered with hair  I found the outhouse and also found two red eyes looking back at me So I think a bigfoot or more lives in the area Standing just on the dirt road, facing us was a Bigfoot I said I wasn't sure because I didn't want to sound crazy by saying it was bigfoot  Hot weather may have driven the bigfoot uphill From the Union Democrat, Tuesday, January 29, 1963: PURSUIT LED BY SHERIFF King-sized tracks were traced today in efforts to confirm or halt reports a 10-foot monster is roaming Tuolumne county brushlands  At that point I resumed my hunting for deer and dismissed the Bigfoot What struck me as odd was, why would anyone be walking in FREEZING cold (likely glacier run-off) water in the dark morning hours, not anywhere near any trails, and not anywhere near any roads...? (We had to hike to this spot and it's a mile from our car, down a very steep heavily forested hillside full of underbrush, which is why this spot was so hard to find and it was an accidental find, and why it stays secluded.) It had me pondering for the last few months and even brought me to considering maybe it was a bigfoot because it sounded like two legs, not the way a bear would sound trudging through the water The area around my house is very densely wooded and my backyard is so forested that it's hard to see in the dark more than maybe 20 feet in It was just after dark and our friends (who are very catholic) had just crossed the bridge saw something cross the road from left to right just ahead of them We went to bed proud of our catch and tired from the sun and the lack of oxygen due to the high altitude [9350 feet]  Some time later, it was still dark out, I heard what sounded like a tree branch being wacked against the trunk of a tree, it had specific patterns and rhythms...but the interval of time between ""episodes"" was random...I heard similar noises from another spot in the area I started to pull away and I looked down and there over the tracks we made earlier going down the road were the biggest footprints I have ever seen, then I knew that was no bear We then heard about 3 or 4 more footsteps and that was it His description was of a bipedal creature, covered in hair clearly over 6 ft tall and weighing more than 190 lbs.  I had followed the creek bed for about a mile when I came upon two sets of footprints in the mud along the creek bed  I don’t remember seeing any sign of ears on the animal – too much long hair around the side of the head – and there was no discernable neck We both saw this at the same time.It was making a bee line towards us.It scared the hell out of us and we ran as fast as we could trying to bike up the hill but it was faster running in the end, until we got nearer the top.There was no way it was a bear.It was clearly running like a man and the head was small like a man, with dark eye sockets .It was moving fast as it was a steep grade it was coming down.Whether it was running from something or at something, i dont know. I decided to return to the motor home, as I turned to retrace my steps (I was probably 50 feet from the noise) this huge hulk stood up in front of me and made a loud screeching noise We followed the prints for approximately 1 mile, but never saw anything except the continuing footprints There this thing went up this hill on 2 legs and stepped high enough that, even my good buddy who was a body builder and in great shape, could not climb It happened too fast to make out special features like feet, hands or the shape of the head I could tell it was big and tall, had long, dark brown hair It was not real wide but, it was wider than a humans foot would be It was a little spooky but at the time i was cross-country running almost 5 miles a day at 8000 feet as well as boxing training and being a good bow hunter nothing scared me at that time Now my husband is the type of guy that would have to be knocked down by a bigfoot before he would believe ""You see Bigfoot this morning?"" They knew who I was  She pointed it out to me, it was a large hairy mammal standing in front of a rock about 100 yrds away with it's left arm extended upward holding on to a rock ledge Then around 6 feet towards the edge of the bank was the front half of another print with five toes only they were big around like a man's bare foot would have been after the snow melted around it, but they were not from a man and the tracks were fresh It was there I found a third print and took a couple of pictures of that print as well, with one being my foot next to it to get the size I got a very good look at this thing and I know that it was about 7 feet tall , had a black wool covering the whole body with a face like untanned leather, almost yellow  Finally it moved around to the front door, which was only about five feet high and Butch got my old .22 rifle and said, ""Open the door!""  I did not want to open the door but did anyway He was just shorter than the bridge uprights, and they were ten feet tall! ""Oh, crap"", I thought  Injured Mule – Our rented mule, “Nancy”, was tied to a small pine tree in a small clearing approximately 50 feet from our camp/tent They werent very clear, but each print was about 15"" long and the they were a good 4+ feet apart  We believe it was ""bigfoot."" It was only on two feet!! It concerned me enough to realize that it didn't sound like a 4 legged animal at the time, but I didn't know what was different until I heard your recordings We arrived at the lake at about 11pm and sat on the car next to some big green trash bins about 150 feet or so from the lake; when we heard something 400 feet or so breaking branches in a canyon to our backs At this point I took out my cell phone and snapped a picture of the foot print The thing, what ever it was, walked upright, and had a 3 to 4 foot gait I looked over at the old growth area and there stood Big Foot Always the dirt beneath our feet was covered with the prints of bears  I explained the sound to him and I said I think it was a Bigfoot  I thought it could have been a really tall man in some kind of camouflage suit, but it looked like no man that I have ever seen I was awake, it was a hot and dark night in these mountains I then told the employees what my son and I had heard and one of them said it sounds like a bigfoot to me The diameter of the base was at least a foot or more The 200 foot cliff below the ledge is VERY steep and to a tradational climber would be rated at least a 5.9 or 5.10 chaucy climb  The tracks also seemed to sink alot deeper into the sand than the footprints of my dad, who is pretty big (6',2"")  I looked - still not afraid - and was trying to figure out what the heck it was; I could make out long fingers and very dark furry brown hair covering the entire ""arm""  The waters had sheared off the top at about the 12 foot level No discernable ball of foot was observed As it got dark, we were sure that the bears would swim the river and come for us next It was almost completely dark, there was some light starting to become visible, there where no other vehicles I was shining a flashlight along the hill and almost immediately notice a tall furry brown creature walking on 2 legs from left to right for about 30 to 40ft I began hearing brush breaking about 50 -100 feet behind me  However, I quickly reminded myself it was dark reddish brown, so not likely naked especially with the water in the 40 degree range I have seen Bigfoot two times 3) Set of footprints and 3 pieces of feces -Upper Slate Creek I know what we had seen that night .His body shape was that of a runner vary tall and slim and muscular not fat lean strong I read Bigfoot books as a kid, and immediately recognzed them as Sasquatch sign, but since I was in a hurry, and not too sure if I belived in him or not, I only spent a few minutes in examination He was covered with dark hair and had long arms I am 6’ tall and was not able to match this step, especially not in shin-deep snow  One set was about a size 14, the other about a size 9, comparing them to my own foot at the time  In the periods when I shut the saw off, I soon started to realize I was getting side hilled by something that was downslope of me off the trail about maybe 100 to 150 feet just inside the tree line The head was very large with no neck to be seen, and the eyes about ten to twelve inches apart,with round glowing orange appearance I use my High Beams because it is so dark through there and everyone does because it is like signaling any opposing traffic of your whereabouts (everyone is usually polite to lower them upon the distance closing) I have, however, been interested in the Bigfoot/Sasquatch developments ever since and feel that this is an undiscovered species The grass in the Meadow obscured some of the legs  When my husband came home he said he saw a bigfoot print in the soft dust next to the dirt road Hair was high on my list to find but I didn’t find any It was totally black out, no moon, no light of any kind, and we never saw anything We were walking along and suddenly we came upon the giant footprints in the sand I then noticed a slightly smaller (6-7 foot tall)(pos male due to no obvious breasts or femine movements) come out from the tree line behind the other male trailing him by about 30 feet and slightly south by about ten feet I asked her and she said she saw a dark face with deep inset eyes and a shaggy head looking at her from behind a tree After taking the picture I resumed my hunting and I moved along the tree line following the foot prints The stride between the prints were approximately 6 feet apart  First I must say that I don't think a bigfoot lives real close to where I live but I do think we live within it's (plural) normal range or migration route I had heard of Bigfoot, but didn't know that they had been heard screaming He was about 5' tall, and hairy all over It looked like a very tall ape, but it looked more built like a human my kids got scared after that....i walked up the hillside where the prints lead about 20' into the woods, very minimal light, i saw 2 large black shapes laying down, one very large, and one about my girlfriends size about 5 feet away from the big one The windows were clouded inside with moisture, and the night was dark Most told me that big foot are only in the north-west in Oregan/Washington Now what made all of this so sobering that morning was that the prints looked like large humanoid feet  I was sleeping in the back of my truck but I couldn't see anything in the dark I had never heard of a Bigfoot at that time, but I knew these were not bears Ruben swore that whatever it was out there was going to cast it's shadow down on them with its hairy arms out-stretched, swoop down and yank them out of the tent, tearing everything into shreds! Ruben knew what all the usual forest animals sounded like His eyes were large as if he were use to living in darker environment The trail gets very heavy use (tho didnt see anyone yesterday) so the prints are most likely a prank or maybe superimposed boot prints, but they interested me enough to make this report (i personally dont believe in bigfoot)  Some other striking features that I noticed were a flat, square jawed face; a flat, dark looking nose; no noticeable hair on the face; and a “sloping fore head”  It was about 15 feet from him and breathing very heavily tall I have heard many stories about Bigfoot, and known that they are real but when seeing one in real life....you get a sense of respect for them and just have that feeling that there is more to life than you know. Human eyes don't do that! He was pretty far from our vehicle, and no I didn't see his face We immediately turned off the music and grabbed our firearms, rechecked that they were loaded and, frankly, just sat there stunned They were shaped like human bare feet My Dad did that and I remember him standing under the bag of food a good three feet over his head about 10 to 15 feet from the door to our tent to the left One of the investigations was a night time walk up a hill at a rancher's property in Covelo; earlier in the week, from what I remember hearing, was a Bigfoot had been interacting twice with his horses, which he chased off, so we hit that spot The hair was not fur like of a  bear at all  We have a very good dinner that night and turned in right after dark  What I have deduced is that a bigfoot was balled up hiding from me!  And it semi worked I then followed where the deer had ran to see what was making that noise I walked very slowly came around the tree and about thirty yards down the tree line I saw a large figure with black hair sitting under a large pine tree sunning, it had large shoulders four to six inch hair but you could still see the muscular definition of its chest and shoulders there was a fallen tree blocking my view below its waistline the last twenty feet to the car was easy I slowly crept ahead and began to stop as this bear was shuffling down this embankment on two feet, but it was not a bear I went to the place I saw it (60 yards) and found no footprints as the ground had at least a foot of pine needles that cushioned footprints and would spring back up when you walked To this day I wish to god we would have stayed until morning to see footprints or something I could make out a ridge in the dirt where the ball of the heal and the middle of the foot come together  I noticed a bigfoot squatting down in the creek bed catching fish We stopped fishing and then tried looking into the darkness.This small boulder throwing continued at least 2 more times before we actually saw a dark figure about 40 yards away standing what looked about waist high in the river When I heard the recordings of Bigfoot screams I knew then that we had heard the exact same thing I could not judge sex of the animal, only that it was brown, walked on two legs and was approximately six feet tall I cannot say this is a Bigfoot event I shone my flashlight and saw a pair of eyes down hill from me but they were as tall as I  We walked down the trail slowly because it was very dark and I had only brought a small flashlight that I always keep in the jeep since we hadn't fully unpacked  However, when I could not see any sign of anything I was totally mystified and thought that I might backtrack and get closer to the spot and see if anyone or anything was hiding  Its right side was as tall as the canes I knew to be 8 foot-ish arms that hung below the knees and were still huge It was as if I could practically reach out to the stars that clear bright night and (as well the moon was out partially) some of the ledges on those high peaks were a bit scary driving by them as it was so dark and far down I couldn’t see how far At approximately 1 a.m., we heard a scream 20 feet to the left of the tent (our heads were facing the ocean) It sounded almost identical to some supposed bigfoot screams that have been recorded over the years She said that she saw it walking on two legs and that it looked like a monkey, about 5 1/2 feet tall, with light brown fur We sat in our dark camp until about midnight then everyone wanted to sleep Arms seemed long with a long stride  I kept my eyes peeled for any movement At first, I thought it was a man with long brown hair, but then noticed that it had hair on its arms and back It had long arms like a gorilla or something, and it sort of lumbered forward like a gorilla only fast with definite long strides; it had something it was aiming for and when it looked at me it turned its head back straight and this thing jumped off the road like an elk on one leg  It was about 6-7 ft tall, thick matted brown fur and walking upright  After all Bigfoot is not and should not be anyone’s first thought and it wasn’t mine  I looked around briefly to see if I could see what the creature had been doing, footprints, etc., but I found nothing Moving then uphill and to the SE, I regained the Bryan Meadow trail and there noted a large footprint, which I photographed next to my two-way radio In the lower NW corner was a patch of forest that was not cut about 20 feet circumference and located just a few yards into the clearcut from where you would park I found, however, no other footprints or enough context to draw any real conclusion about the impression I noted the eyes of the creature as black melting into the darkness of it's face About no more than ten seconds later we saw what looked like a 10 foot man, covered in hair My story of Bigfoot was not visual but rather we heard a scream in the deep forest that we could not explain  It could not have been a bear, they can't walk that far on 2 legs, nor that smoothly or quickly. by this time it was very minimal light, started walking back our dog took a crap in the path ahead, and you could see it darker on the yellowish oak leave covered dirt path, and we could see to avoid it, when we got to the area that i moved the tree, my son said to me, watch out there is something dark and smooshy there, i stopped and looked at it, he said to me, it looks big though the thing had stopped about seventy feet before the car i stood watch as she loaded the car in record speed It was on two feet and they were clearly audible, heavy footsteps  On the hike back we talked quite a bit about what we had heard and were joking that it was probably several bigfoots communicating with each other  Almost like cat eyes, but not yellow like cat eyes, they were more silver, or white This was the third year we had done this and the plan was to spent the night at 9200 feet and do the peak the next day It appeared 7 to 8 feet tall w/ thick brown/black hair After a better look, it had hair all over its body, but it seemed more of an orange-brown color He is an Army veteran from Iraq and an avid hunter, and he was simply shocked by that footprint I quickly scanned the woodline with my head lamp, seeing nothing out of the ordinary through the dark and rain  This mule’s ears were laid back; her eyes were wide open and darting about The creature was standing on a rock, balancing very well as if to have a bend in the middle of it's foot  We played there for a good while and returned to the campground when it started getting dark I don’t know if the dead silence, or if the heavy footsteps woke me up The next morning there were footprints going up the hill like whatever it was had two large feet with a big toe  After awhile, tt was getting dark and Highway 120 was deserted, they hadn't even seen another car since Buck Meadows it was dark by now  no cars nothing all day Was it a bigfoot? Did we have a Bigfoot encounter? We felt something special had just happened I’ve heard through the years about this big foot stuff, and I’m not sure what this thing was, but while I was at the window looking I could hear foot steps in the leaves I had little fear of the dark, or the night, and it was my goal to see a bear I tried my hardest to dig my foot into the dirt as deep as the prints were, but to no avail and were on top of our footprints where we had crossed the trail going down the hill less than 10 minutes before Although I didn't actually get out of the truck, I opened the door and looked down to see if I could see footprints or any clue of what this thing was The arms were very long, and hung straight down  I saw what looked to be a hairy human figure, about 6-6 1/2' tall, running behind my bike My husband was approximately 10 feet away from me Anyway, I had just turned off my radio (with headphones), and was drifting off to sleep, when I heard these heavy-sounding footsteps moving around my tent  In the middle of the trail and not far from this smell, and the foot prints we had seen, was a large pile of oak acorns It was hair not fur and matted and dark brown but with a rusty auburn tint to it By the time we pitched the (4) man umbrella tent it was dark To the left  and upper part of the field, we both spotted two very large and hairy animals chasing the sheep I saw a dark outline of a creature looking into the front room After a few more steps, more noise and this time I instinctively did look up to see a large creature walking up the edge of the brush line about three feet out of  the clearcut At this time it had just begun to get dark As we passed a tight hairpin turn we had not said anything for hours because of the monotonous trip I do not know whether it was a bigfoot or not, but if it was a bear it had to be standing upright and at least 7 feet tall It was definitely a male and was dark brownish black in color The hair on its head was dark brown to light black if such a color exists this report is for my daughter who today thinks she saw two big creatures that looked like the  creature called bigfoot We all looked at each other with “saucer eyes” when I exclaimed, “that’s a Squatch!”  He wasn’t dangerously close, but close enough to cause me to slow down and say something along the lines of “What an asshole!”  As I got nearer to him, my first thought was, “He’s really tall.”  My second thought was, “What is he wearing?  He’s got something on that is solid black from head to toe, and there aren’t any lines to denote a jacket, or a collar or pant legs.” He appeared to be in silhouette, with the sun behind him The ranger had suggested a great camping and fishing location, but because it was starting to get later in the afternoon, there was no way I would make it all the way before dark The hair on its back was not as long as on its leg but by the time it got to its shoulders, it was longer again and brown to dark brown This happened yesterday: My wife and I were exploring some forest land northeast of West Point, Calaveras County, CA yesterday in our 4x4 and on foot, scouting for deer Also my friend noticed smaller Bigfoot tracks coming down from a very steep draw on the left of the road I told my dad that I saw something walking on 2 feet and he said that he saw something moving over in that direction as well This seemed to go maybe 50 feet or so into very thick brush  I came across a section of forest floor where there was mostly decomposed granite, and as I followed this - which was a bit easier to travel on - I come across two sets of footprints  The stride was unhurried Both nights were clear and quite dark with partial moonlight but the area has a lot of trees so there are shadows even though you can see well enough to walk over to the restrooms without a flashlight It sounded like the source was not more than twenty to thirty feet away! The “crazy whistle” coming from the direction of the cabin stopped immediately As I drove past the location where the animal had entered the brush I looked out the passenger window and to my surprise I saw it's face in the brush looking right into the window only a few feet away I would have to estimate it at 7'0 to 8'0 tall, somewhat of a chocolate color, and very mobile for its size It looked at us (me) It was a light grey color and had long shaggy hair The edges of the creek, about 20 feet per side, were dry and exposed rocks and boulders The creature stopped just behind the nearest tree trunk (15 feet? away) and just stood there breathing Below me about 35 feet down a granite cliff was a stream that did have a pool in it, right on the tree line At any rate, we all wondered, “What was that!”  And Bigfoot came to mind I've seen various footage and photographs of Bigfoot/Sasquatch sightings over the years and have always been extremely skeptical of their authenticity I guess we really didn't want to believe that we had heard a bigfoot but we both knew that there is no other animals in the woods that can make the type of screams and roars that we had heard I started hollering at it, and chucked the other two rocks I had with me, one landing at his feet, and the other hitting somewhere near his hip I shined my flashlight on its legs very briefly through the tent mesh then I turned the light away, pointing it at my chest It only walked a few feet and then stopped, leaned over slightly and rested its forearms on a tan oak that was bent and facing horizontally in the air about 4 1/2 ft high It stays lite very late in the summer and we usually fish until dark I observed it for about 3 to 4 strides It was about 8 feet tall It stood about 6’6” to 7 ft tall  It is about 4575 feet elevation  I hear that many people die or have very bad luck after seeing a Bigfoot This was not wildlife; this was CLEARLY a bipedal footfall At this point I'm about 500 feet from these things and the trees they were in all the while  walking up over the crest of the hill, into the darkness  We had, a pair of eyes glowing in the distance I've only heard larger animals on wildlife programs and I am holding out the hope that one of your specialists will call me back and explain that what we heard was just a ""such and such"" and often is confused with a Big Foot call  I heard bi pedal footsteps walking away through the oak leaves  It was now probably 7:00 or 7:30 so the sun was disappearing and it was getting dark We arose the next morning and went outside, and looked around the circumference of the tent for footprints I was scared **itless! I threw two more rocks in quick succession, and they bounced on the deck, and flew off into the dark, one splashing into the creek Morbius from the movie Forbidden Planet? Maybe Bigfoot is the ID, coagulated from the quantum soup of our collective unconscious mind It was not overly tall probably just six feet or a little taller, but extremely was thick maybe in the 300 pound range this thing was built  For I saw two yellow eyes watching me very intently  Eventually, it jumped from the porch, which was a six to eight foot drop While deer hunting my father in law and I had become lost while following a game trail we took a short cut from one hill to the next and had crossed a ravine at the bottom as we crossed the ravine we found another game trail as we followed this trail I noticed large 14 to 15 inch human type foot prints impressed deeply into the trail these track led down a hill until the terrain became to difficult to follow.  I realized that was the sound that I heard and it was in fact the famous wails and whooping sounds of sasquatch!  Bigfoot does exist!  The next year (2001; I go every year) I found what looked like humungus human tracks but with only 4 toes (I am not positive they were related to Bigfoot though). The hair was long on his calves, forearms, hands and feet so I just saw tips of long fingers As i was seeing it the legs were fairly long and then I got to the head  The eyes which were reflected in my flashlight seemed to crouch down The Bigfoot Seemed Confused, Wondering How He Was Going To Handle These Intruders, Checking Out ""His"" Hut! XXX Leaned Against A Tree, And Filmed About 5 Minutes Worth Of Video  I was about twenty feet from the window so I am certain that it did not see me  The body imprint (matted down veg), was 7 feet long The creature was over six feet tall, and had the shape of a man When I tell people I have seen Bigfoot, and they think I am crazy Instead we heard catious and quite footsteps heading away from our campsite It was limping along this slope that was covered in about 12 inches of oak leaf duff and the drag of the second (possibly injured) foot was loud through these leaves It smelled of dead animals, and rotten food, and funky bad feet and armpits Over the year, I became obsessed with bigfoots My wife noticed the eyes as reflextive, I did not The pond was about 75 to 100 feet across, the banks were covered in cat tails and the pond was full of trout (we tried all day to catch some fish, without luck) By this time it was dark but lit enough to see which way he was headed As you might imagine, I was very excited about  this, it's not every day that you see a set of huge footprints like this in the snow!, and tried to get my aunt and uncle to come outside to have a look Shortly before turning in for the evening, I heard a short series of what sounded like heavy footsteps on the rocky terrain of the hillside, in the rhythm of a two-legged walk It was extremely dark at the time, since the sun was not yet up and the area is against the mountain side to the North and North East sides I was born and raised in Port Orchard, WA, so I'm very familiar with Sasquatch and BigFoot tales By the look in his eyes, I believe he could see what we could not  I could barely see its eyes in the dark, but I noticed them when it looked left and right  It was dusk, quite dark already in the forest  He said he heard heavy footsteps, heavy breathing, and some grunting The foot falls were very heavy, almost like someone was jumping, but the steps seemed pretty rapidly placed It had reddish-brown hair all over it and it matched the color of the bark on the trees perfectly After the creature yelled it took off again through the forest heading inland it took only a few seconds and it was to far away to hear the foot steps anymore The figure was of a uniformly dark color, perhaps black. I told him you must have had been a Bigfoot visit you She was kind of freaked out about it but I was rather excited as I have been interested in seeing or hearing some kind of bigfoot evidence Below him, a small stream followed a darkened canyon around a bend It was of dark color but not sure if dark brown or black as it was shady in the grove with sunlight behind it in the clearing I was recently over the three-day weekend up in the eastern Sierras hiking at about twelve thousand feet, and something happened that I can't explain and I just thought I would call you guys and tell you about it if you're interested The noise was within forty feet of my position, and I would describe it as a single pop sound  If it was a back packer, to be moving that fast, he would have to be running and running with a back pack is anything but smooth; if he was riding a bike, then why couldn't I see the bike and its arms and legs were in line with its body, not bent at an angle like it was sitting on something Number one, bigfoot do not live so far south in California (or so I thought), and my brother did not come in and say, ""I just saw a bigfoot!""  So it never occurred to either of us that this was a bigfoot sighting!!!  It wasn't until a couple of years later that I asked him if what he saw could have been a bigfoot and he said,"" oh yeah, that makes sense now...""  It took us awhile to put 2 and 2 together but we finally did with the help of this website The photo of a Bigfoot creature from the “Patterson film” looks very much like that being I observed in August 1964. While riding in the back country, she claims to have seen Bigfoot walking through a meadow below a bluff she was riding atop.  Needless to say in 1962 I didn't know what bigfoot was so I turned my bike around and got the hell out there Then, still screaming, it turned around and ran back down the road in the darkness at a fast rate of speed The road was too rocky for footprints Just as I stepped out of the trees I spotted a large foot print  It had hardly no neck, and very long arms that hung down by its mid legs  I am a law enforcement officer and know that I saw ""Bigfoot"" - there is no doubt about it. By the time I looked back to where the bigfoot was, he already had come back out of the brush and was walking uphill  The weekends were made for pitching camp and swiming in the Rattlesnake Creek that runs along the foot of the property As I sat in my foxhole waiting and listening, a fox walked by on the dirt road not more than about eight feet from my eyeballs Oh and as close as I was the eyes didn't glow A couple of months ago the same friend gave me a video tape of the Discovery Channel show about Bigfoot On the shore was Bigfoot walking down towards the water  It looked as if it was on it's knees hunched over with its head on the ground and it's arms over it head The next morning Arden and I went up on the bluffs and found a cleared area about thirty feet across there was one great print, and a half a dozen others about 3'- 4' stride My eyes shifted from side to side with only slight and very slow head movements from side to side to widen my view I saw a tall dark figure peering around a large red fir stump I noticed it in the shade of the upper branches because one of its legs was swinging back and forth below the branch Johnson estimates the size as 10 feet tall, four feet across the shoulders and as much as 750 pounds I then asked if his arms were short or long  It had its arms to its side and was rocking slowly, side to side The next night it was back again, but this time I saw out my window this hairy thing which was very-very tall The strides were about 4 feet Maybe, Bigfoot is us. I didn't even hear footsteps It was 16 sounds of Bigfoot in the Serras, the 7th sound The voice itself sounded like a cross between the 1973 Puyallup sounds and the 1993 Del Norte County ""angry Bigfoot"" scream  I said, ""It's possible that Bigfoot was looking for food or was heading for the spring at the end of the fence.""  We then proceeded to do are work so that we could finish this area and head for the other area  Upon inspecting the depression we noticed what appeared to be a left foot print, and a right leg outstretched in the pine needle cover on the ground We joked that it could have been bigfoot, except we were too far south After reading report 7804, I suspect that my son may have seen a bigfoot in early December, 2003 Nothing else happened until it got dark and we went to bed Again it only went about 50 feet back My book, ""Night-Side of Gold,"" was written from hindsight remembrance of encounters with Bigfoot during an 8-year mining venture in the Santa Lucias along the coast of Southern California My tent is about 4 feet tall maybe a little less and what I saw was more than twice as tall  After totally analyzing the figure, the blackness, I thought if it is a bigboot it must have eyes He states that the season prior that one employee said he seen close up and it was covered with hair The eyes in the headlights were RED, but yet the teeth did not seem to shine yet you knew they were teeth, also the mouth area seemed to be almost flat like, in other words more human like, and not a snout like a bear or cat would have  I continued turning until I was looking directly down the small footpath I just walked to the rock Then after it got dark, I climbed into my sleeping bag looking to the east to the Crystal range, I think it is called, and watched as the glow of a full moon worked it's way up over the top of the granite mountains For the remainder of the darkness I pretty much stayed put with the ledge to my back and my gun in my hand, and shaking in my skin  I did not tell my family about my Bigfoot suspicians, but my brother did mention to me later that he heard a ""bear"" walking along the shore that night, near where the houseboat was aground The area was about thirty feet across [hard packed red clay], w/ an old shed to the right against some manzanita brush ""Do we shoot it? Should we shoot it? What do we do? Do you want to follow it?"" As we talked, we heard a sound that we both immediately recognized from the prior night, the sound of the Bigfoot slowly walking deeper into the woods, breaking deadfall, twigs and branches as he went It had to have been 7 plus feet tall, thin and long stringy hair hanging off its body I do know my original feeling was it was a big hairy head and face with eyes They were very heavy footfalls like from a heavy man and sounded like someone running flat-footed in boots He was running, taking long strides, and was gone in about 3 seconds.....and was literally pushing trees out of his way (not breaking them, but  pushing them out of his way)  Its arms were longer than a man's and I could see the hair flop up and down as it ran 15-20 feet in front of us Its legs, although a little longer than a mans, seemed proportioned to a mans in shape  It was extremely dark, almost shadowy but very much real  The outhouse was located in an area that was about 10 feet below the trail from the campground I grew up in the Wilderness of Klamath Falls, Oregon, I've seen the animals that God has put on this planet, and this isn't anything I've seen before except on all these videos of sightings, Think of Patty, that's what I saw, I dunno if it was threatening at all, it was to me, there's been alot of unsaid sighting that happen in the Red Buttes Wilderness which extends from the Ore/Cal boarder, to hwy 96 Siskyou county, Saied Valley, Happy Camp, Indian Creek Road, Oregon Caves National Monument, and prolly 1000's of more.I read on a report that a hippy farmer from Talkemla says that he and his cohorts since they were little have been warned about the bigfoot living in this area, and that they are highly territorial,aggressive, and traveling into this area, is putting yourself in oppotunity/danger of running into one of these creatures It was so dark I couldn't see a thing I wish I would have gone to the area where I saw it and looked for some evidence or footprints but I was too scared to stray off the path since it was able to disappear in the brush / tufas so easily. Everytime I closed my eyes, I would hear the growls and the rocks splashing and then see her coming at me  This continued for about an hour until it got too dark to see clearly without a flashlight Dark brown or black fur that was medium length  I was curious, though I hadn't made the Bigfoot connection yet  The howls would start after two men with dogs started out into the forest after dark We had both heard about Bigfoot but it wasn't something that came to mind when we heard the screams  I brought my small camouflage binoculars up to my eyes slowly and looked across this meadow My college aged son and his friends were imitating ""Big Foot"" sounds that they'd heard on the internet  I do have some lingering doubts however that what we heard may have been a mountain lion maybe???  (a link to normal wildlife sounds would be great to at least rule out the possibilities of other noises)    The sound was VERY similar to the ohio bigfoot screams but higher in pitch and what i would call ""angrier"" sounding.....it was a very threatening sound.... my girlfriend was about twenty feet away panning I knew whatever it was a long distance away by this point, so before leaving the area I drove down the road with my brights on, trying to see if I could see any footprints or signs of anything odd  The creek was about 8 to 10 feet wide, so it took several steps to get across Approximate sizes were 3"" deep, 17"" long with a 5 foot stride between each print On the camera my wife tells me to make my “Whoop-Whoop” Bigfoot call, into the redwood forest Eventually we pulled into a campsite (second or third from the entrance at the foot of a large hill) About 6 years ago they had a program on TV that had recorded the noise believed to be Bigfoot  The arms were long, as were the fingernails, and fingers On the other side, we found a large red ant hill with a footprint right on top of it The hair on the back of my neck instantly stood up, and I was terrified I grew up in Happy Camp CA in which is a small town where Bigfoot is an icon! However, I have never believe in him as we walked the path the next 10-15 ft, we heard bipedal walking 2-3 steps, stopped when we stopped, and then continue The creature was walking North away from me at a 90 degree angle on two feet  Anyway, we were driving west on 299 when from our left a reddish-tan (more tan than red) image stepped onto the roadway and in two strides was over the road and into the ravine on the right side of the road  Then to our surprise we found a broken branch next to one of the footprints that had three hair samples clinging to the bark We were from Southern California, and were totally unfamiliar with the area The arms of this bigfoot were long and swayed as he walked and he was very tall, i noted that he walked next to a tall sign on the highway and his shoulders were in line with the 55 mile speed limit highway sign on hwy 299 I then realized that this was to tall and to wide to be a person  It was dark but I could feel its size when it walked and shook the canes  I compared  compared the beast to a friend who is six foot two inches tall and weights three hundred pounds  I was still thinking it was a homeless person with huge barefeet!  I'm a size 12, I put my foot inside this track.. I did not speak with anyone about it right away because who ever heard of a desert Bigfoot, But later found out that all the locals call him, ""Yucca Man"".  The next time I saw Bigfoot, I was at Lake Shasta in the late 1990s Within a minute or two I heard approximately 10 to 13 VERY heavy footsteps heading more or less in my direction You in a hurry?"" I told him no, but that I was not about to drive back down the road in the dark He didn’t believe in Bigfoot before that night but now he is starting to I was really focused on the fishing since I was very eager to catch something before it got too dark What makes this remarkable was that, at the time, this same fence came up to my chest and was about 4.5 feet in height I saw one of these sasquatch-bigfoot things one night walking on the side of the highway My hair stood on end and I called my husband at work who thinks the whole thing is fabulous It is about twice the length of my foot, (a size 12 boot size) As I rounded the turn and was approaching the end of the turn while watching my high beam shadows of the barricade up in the trees, I noticed this BIG Dark Shadow cast in the trees from my lights as I rolled along and my lights lit up a Giant Creature walking along the opposite side, going against traffic- facing away from me We spotted what appeared to be Bigfoot tracks in the snow  But I was never looking for bigfoot until now not like your typical bigfoot print.this is within miles of sugarpine area, and foresthill I'd guess the elevation was 8,500 feet, as the top of the hill was 10,000 and our camp was at the base of about 7,000 It had a very large walking stride I didn't see anything as it was very dark and whatever this was was in an area of trees The animal had to have stood up again immidiately after entering the brush to reach the hight required to look into my window, that would place the animal at approximately 8 feet tall It was a dark night but it was darker than the brush and silhouetted very well The stride between each print was about six to seven feet apart and each print seemed to be about 4 to 5 inches deep, if not more Now, in the Lagunas around Julian, in San Diego County, I have been actively pursuing reports of Bigfoot in these mountains and the Anza-Borrego Desert below, and most particularly within a certain Indian Reservation I don’t recall the exact time, but it seemed like I had been in the foxhole for a few hours when I started seeing what looked like faint eyeshine on my right, the opposite direction from the cabin  To my shock the footprint was much longer than my boot! While not very wide it was dramatically bigger than mine The legs were muscular and human like Its gait was very unhuman like bent at the waist and  arms swinging like you might see a vaudeville actor do at the end of a show as they exit the stage, a bit looney tunes like It was then I spied a huge brown/black hairy back trucking up the peak at a very fast pace But, bears do not walk through heavy brush on 2 legs  Later years..when Big Foot  was reported..  He was Light Grey to Smokey Charcoal Grey with some Black deeper in beneath his hair closer to his body Sitting inside we heard it again and it sounded as  though it was now in the medow below us, but the darkness made it imposible to see anything It's hair was long like a horses mane and 'flowed'  I looked in the direction they were barking and standing in a suger beet field thirty to forty feet away was a humanoid figure covered in long shaggy grey hair  They were very wide prints, and appeared neary flat-footed By the sound of its footsteps and its breathing, we figured whatever this was, it was huge and it was walking on (2) feet  The next morning, both my son and I checked the area and confirmed that no trees or other objects were present for an animal to stand on and appear to be seven feet tall  It was a very flat face, very dark brown - couldn't make out any features except the eyes, which were looking right at me!  Let me tell you, I was never very athletic, but as soon as we made eye contact I don't think my feet touched the ground!  Worse yet, I had to run right BY IT to get the heck outta there!  I FLEW back to camp and ran into the trailer I happened to look back in the darkness behind the truck as it darted forward and in the dimness of the tail lights I seen this awful dark hairy figure standing upright behind the truck We had to learn more about bigfoots  He said it sounded like a very big man with over size boots on and very heavy and on two legs  The camper was on the bed of my utility truck, and was at least five feet off the ground Nowhere did we see any human foot prints by any of these tracks or up that steep hill We could not see anyone and the hair started raising on the back of our necks  But to my surprise there was a somewhat sandy area near the sighting and I noticed a footprint that had distinct toes As I was going up the mountain, I rounded a corner and about 300 feet from me and maybe 400 feet front tintagel lane, a tall hairy creature, dark brown with some gray along the back shoulders, walking on two legs, crossed the road (which is wide enough for 2 cars to pass each other) in about 2 steps and then was in the woods We could hear it circling the tent, because the ground was covered with bark, and we could hear the bark crunching under its feet I was standing within 10 feet from where the whistle came from, nothing in sight not in the trees on the ground not anywhere, no bird's where flying and no animals in sight either A few years later, my family and I were watching T V and a program came on about Bigfoot The noise maker was in a position that provided a perfectly clear view of me sitting in the darkness on the porch There was a slip mark running about 2 1/2 feet down the muddy slope and what looked like another ball of the foot impression in the embankment as well it was the hair on the back of your neck being watched felling I don't want to hurt anything, but I don't want to get my head ripped off by something just on the other side of the dark roadside either  From the boat he appeared to be at least 7 to 8 feet tall It was dark and we were in our bed rolls Again my friend asked: ""What do you think that is?"" I gave the guarded response: ""I'll tell you what, I've spent alot of time in the woods and observed alot  of animals, but I've never heard anything like this."" I assume he read through the evasion to the meaning of my response, given the ubiquitous usage of the word ""Bigfoot"" , and images thereof, in the surrounding communities and some casual conversation we had had on the subject during our drive It didn't occur to me the next morning that it was a sasquatch so I didn't look for footprints I don't dwell on the bigfoot subject, nor have I made it a mission to seek them out, but I know they’re out there Our tent was right on the edge of the trail, and whatever was out there walking was on two feet and very big, we could almost feel the ground shake as it got closer  It walked like a man, upright and swinging it's long arms Inspection of the hillside would be dangerous and turn up little or nothing in the way of footprints; 2 Thats when we saw just for a moument a large creature walking on two feet over the ridge and out off sight It stood up on two legs and ran quickly past us to the left of my vehicle, still holding the chicken A friend of mine then told me about the BFRO Wedsite and we logged on and found out that there were other hikers that had reported actually seeing a couple of Bigfoots in the Desolation Wilderness not very far from where we had camped It had long darkish brown hair that covered its entire body I was totally curious as to what it was but scared at the same time Me and my family decided to go fishing at Silverwood lake and we got there around 1:30pm......i was fishing by the lake  and after a while of not catching anything i decided to put a 2nd rod about 100ft away from the 1st one..i went back to my 1st and around 3-4pm i decided to check on the 2nd rod and my 3&4 yr old daughters were following me so i sent them back with my wife.i thought they had gone back so i kept on walking towards the 2nd rod all of a sudden i heard leaves crunching to my left about 30 ft away from me i saw an ape like hairy looking creature with light brown hair....it had long arms that were swinging while it ran...it was also crouching a little to the front stood there in shock frozen for a while and realized my 4 year old daughter was behind me running back to my wife yelling ""MOM!MOM! There's a big animal!""then i went back to mu wife and told her what i saw....What amazed me was the speed it was running......  We saw what looked something like a human foot track but, it was way to big with a slight distortion in the toes This past Sunday, 5/23/04 at 10:30 am, we found strange foot prints in the muddy parts in the road along Murry Range, Covelo CA We (in our car) were just behind them maybe like a minute and as we got to the other side of the bridge I was facing my ex talking to her and just over her should I saw something about 9 or 10 feet tall walking like it was walking through the brush Re: Our Bigfoot encounter in California My wife and I have had two incidents over the year, including vocalization and wood knocking There is a deer trial that comes down to creek level about 10 feet away from where I am sleeping and I hear this person coming down it I don't know if it was a Big Foot or not, but after watching the famous video of the Big Foot walking, I noticed that that's the strange way we saw the ""thing"" moving Around 7 or 8 years late I saw a couple of bigfoot movies including the Patterson video Late that night, probably around midnight, we woke up to a large creature walking, actually limping, like a step, drag of foot, step, drag of foot, along the hillside below the road and above the river and us The closet camper was about 100 feet away towards the main office It was tall, dark brown and clearly walked on 2 legs I thought I was the only one awake at the time but when I turned my head to look at my wife, her eyes were wide open His Torso was Longer in proportion to his legs, his leg length of Thigh to Calves was not as long as his upper body- he was Huge I Asked A Friend If He Believed In Bigfoot, He Said ""Yeah"", Then Told The Group This Story: He Told Us How His Friend, XXX, Had Gone Up To Marbel, Mountain Ca I told Wayne there is Bigfoot I just stood there, looking at it then it stopped about 5 feet from me and I could plainly see what was standing there, but I couldn’t believe what I was seeing  This so called ""fisherman"" crossing the river was ""dressed"" in very dark clothing, my girlfriend said, that seemed odd since it was so bloody hot May 13, 2001:  all the broken trees, two nests, and dozens of footprints (14 inches, 5.5 foot stride, trees broken at the 6 to 6.5 foot level) are documented  I figure the Bigfoot traveled to Hoopa from the dump site It could have been a human, but the person would have to have been wearing all uniformly dark clothing and had a dark complexion or been wearing dark paint We tried or best not to ""bait"" her answers: The thing was bigger than me (>7 foot) and had a long beard From examination of the footage of my family whose distance from the camera was comparable to that of the creature it is easy to see the distinct details and variation in clothing, hair, face and hands But having shown this video to family and friends whose opinions I trust, the overall reaction seems to be a unanimous ""Bigfoot!!"" Wishful thinking? Maybe it was a freshly wet imprint of a foot shape, and there were more leading from the lake up into the woods up a steep hillside Although I couldn't see it in the darkness, it was only a few yards away from where I was laying in my sleeping bag He was about eight or nine feet tall and stood with his left shoulder even with the edge of the trail  I seen a huge ape like animal that was reddish brown color, with long straggley looking hair hanging off it's arms, and legs The arms extended far, alittle below the pelvis and looked long and cylindrical and thin I have listened to various recordings of alleged Bigfoot, and I am struck by how similar these recordings are to the scream that we heard I compared them with my own barefoot track for depth and they were nearly twice as deep  I didn't here or see anything after that, however, Greg insists he saw the eyes again, even after I fired the shot A feeling of discomfort came over us both as we saw nor heard any more of what we assumed to be a big black bear coming down the canyon, meaning whatever came down the canyon was hiding in the tree line 300 feet or so away from where we sat I threw the river rock as hard as I could, and it thumped down, just under the eaves of the building, and rolled into a can, Wham! I peered into the darkness, and shadow under the eaves of the cook shack, but could not see anything but a darker shadow, where I though this animal was It didn't have animal eyes that glowed I was taking pictures and videos of my children when I noticed a couple of footprints up the side of the hill Turned off the interior light in the car and sat in the dark a little while, maybe 4-5 mins, then turned it back on  We saw Bigfoot tracks that lead from the water into the forest He just knew that it was heavy and loud and was walking around on two feet!  The crunching and crashing sound was moving along the ridge now, just grunting as it slowly walked away, without screaming anymore This report details a two-year investigation of bigfoot activity in the Twain Harte area by BFRO investigators Kathy Moskowitz and Montra DuMond It had extremely thick legs and shoulders, and no man could make a jump like that It was well over 6 ft tall and was dark and hairy! It was walking like a human! We thought it could of been a bear, but the way it was walking, there's absolutely no chance it was one! I had posted it on my Facebook, and a friend told me to talk to her husband because years ago, around the same area, he swore he saw a bigfoot! This has really sparked interest in me because as an un-believer, I can't come up with another conclusion of what it could of been! We were too afraid to stop, but we are so shocked and confused on what it could of been!!  The man-like creature took off, loping away in a slow run with it's arms sort of hanging down it then turned and began taking huge strides up the mountain, not running, but covering some serious ground.on 2 feet What I saw was what appeared to be an animal covered with black, semi-long hair (two to three inches, to guess), walking upright (fully) with a gape somewhat like the current hominids; and approximately five to six feet in height and weighing one hundred seventy-five to two hundred twenty-five pounds The legs were really muscular, and strong  The entire experience is accounted in ""Bigfoot"", by Ann Slade and Alan Berry, 1976, Bantam Books. Here's a link to the picture that convinced me to tell my experience: http://knobbythebigfoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/gigantopithecus_human.jpg I'm going to start looking for him soon It was dark, around 8:30 or 9:00 PM but the sky was still a little lit up in the West that time of year We picked an open site midway between the foot of the hill and the highway, layed out equipment for drying, then decided to day-hike somewhere nearby Doing this meant that I would start by placing a spike through the open end of a tape measure so I could pull out the tape and measuring 10 feet I heard fast footsteps run through our camp This is not a joke, and when the headlights shined on his eyes they glowed I have heard it before on bigfoot documentaries since then We took him to the exact spot where we saw the Bigfoot and we discovered a trail of giant footprints leading from the trail into the woods At about 2:30 or 3:00 a.m., the three campers suddenly awoke to the sound of the crunch-crunch of footsteps (BIG footsteps) in the snow and brush I wasnt sure what it was but when i looked to my left i saw this big hairy creature it smelled as a garbage can Perceiving this ""hooting"" and ""whacking"" as a less-than-friendly display, we became a little nervous and contemplated leaving; but curiousity and the dread of packing up, moving to an unplanned location and reconstructing in the dark, while already soaked; compelled us to stay my thought-maybe a curious smaller one came down and checked out the tree i pushed into the water and left the wet prints on the way back up? i have more on this, i hate typing, you can tell with my shortness in descriptions, i went back and heard an actual deep breath/slight grunt and more bipedal steps, scared me, even though i know they dont tend to harm people, i totally believe in bigfoot, and i have never seen or heard anything before At first we thought it was a bear but it walk to well on its back feet I was in a remote area and I don.t belive that anyone was near where we were camped to have faked the footprints.  My partner had a bad habit of wanting to catch a wild turkey for pet so as we drove up he took off running after a turkey that was about 40 feet from our truck There is about a 4 foot tall ledge facing the woods where all the activity was going on He looked at me kind of silly and sluffed it off so I just shut up..., ""You've only been up here about 8 months and you've already seen Bigfoot?"" I know what I saw  Although no bigfoot is seen, something very large and walking on two feet approaches the stakeout location The bed of the truck probably moved at least a foot to a foot and a half, about three or four times in a row, quickly This was definitely walking on two feet I believe that i saw bigfoot, with two other witnesses in the vehicle with me We left late that evening, getting their as it turned near dark and I felt my memories would help me find the places I had been as an teen with my dad and park and get some sleep and then wake up at some old cabin  I saw the outline of a body, the reflection of my headlights in it's eyes and it ducked back into the scrub brush before I passed it My father had never told me any stories about bigfoot  (he would deny the existence of any animal that was ""unknown"" until science recognized it anyhow) and to my knowledge, I had not heard of any such animal at that time, nor had I any thing more than a passing interest in these types of things then, but these tracks...thier size, gait, and the way they led across the bar in a strieght line...they made a funny impression on me  Our altimeter read about 8400 feet  I put on my shoes, stepped out of my tent, and kept hearing them, finally realizing that they sounded like the “knocking sounds” described by people who have reported bigfoot encounters  After closing my eyes about 40 minutes, I'm guessing like 1225 AM, I was rested and awake to get going again back to Crescent City I took off, I got about ten feet down the road when my husband pulled up It was a very dark night with fog like clouds low to the ground, so I had to pay very close attention to the road It was on two feet I told my friend to turn around slowly, and look, as he did the Bigfoot melted out of sight back into the forest We both now believe that the sounds we heard came from several Bigfoot type creatures or at least an animal that has not currently been identified We did not smell anything or hear footsteps  My first thought was that it was likely a human footprint because this was a popular area and despite the cooler weather and very cold water someone might take off their shoes Where we were gathering wood was near a large hedge of bushes, approx 6 to 7 feet high and very dense with only 1 path through the bush to skirt the lake without wading in the water We never took our eyes off of the Bigfoot as we spoke We had a hunter at the top of the hill and he went up there in the dark before sunrise Footprints were seen in summer of 1984 near Beartrap Cabin in the Mt It was dark brown and tan in color It was getting dark and again we had a bad feeling about being dwon in the creek bed I am not a believer in Bigfoot per se, but since being up here and that episode, I have to wonder. One evening we drove into the bone yard and about 30 feet in front of us was a dark, 8-foot thing walking away from our vehicle In his words it was bigger than he was and ran right past him on two legs and proceeded down the hill I don't know if it was a mountain lion that could whistle but I believe bigfoot is around and I will continue hunting on around Oroville CA for signs or answers. It had a distinkt two legged run as I would expect a human to have, but was covered with hair (or fur) that was much longer than that of other furry animals and had a rust colored hugh to it  So the Bigfoot didn't walk across the meadow or my husband would have seen him During the last week of August, 1999, myself and a friend left the Kennedy trailhead about an hour before dark I heard a large animal crashing down the hill to my right and caught a glimpse of a dark object which quickly disappeared into the vegetation I know in my heart, I heard bigfoot that night. I sat up in the dark and listened  At this time we decided to load our firearms, which weren’t much because all we had was a 40 caliber pistol and a 22 pistol  Appeared to be very hairy I didn't catch what it was though until I listened to the footsteps of a bipedal walking from your site here They had nothing in their hands or on their feet  It was 4-6 inches longer and 3-4 inches wider than my foot  We have no results from the hair samples because we lost two of the hairs and we only have one in our posession at this time. I was 13 at the time and I had never heard of Bigfoot He had long shaggy hair, very dark brown I flashed my worthless high beams at it and it took 2 giant steps backwards and then one to my left, it's right and was gone into the dark As soon as the branch snapped, I shot out of my chair and then heard the rest of the commotion It's arms were extremly long, hairy, lean yet muscular, It's hands had very long palms and long fingers that curled back with a thumb that curled forward forming a backward capital ""C"" type shape But this thing, that I believe was Big Foot, started splashing and making that strong high pitched screaming noise at the river  I now recall seeing the bushes shake violently and the dark shape stepped out of sight It then was walking in a lanky movement with arms swinging as it crossed the stream/river  Below him he saw a black figure, taller than 5'10"" (my height) The food we had hung 6 feet to 7 1/2 feet of the ground was gone  We could not discern its legs or arms due mostly to the angle at which it was leaving us  It jumped a fence up hill in a full run with out the use of its arms and was gone quick so quick, I knew it was not a person I watched for a few seconds when my brother came running to the truck, white as a ghost and eyes bulging wide Then I immediately thought better of it, as it was obviously a young Big Foot, and I was afraid it's parents might be close by as well and with as fast as that creature ran, who knew the strength of its parents The hair on the back of my neck stood up a bit I continued left into the grove and found a 25 foot tree placed upside down next to another tree well over 50 feet high I did not think anything about bigfoot even though I was interested in the subject, I thought they were all up north in the Shasta and up area We even saw some of the boulders that had been thrown at the bottom of the water as it wasn't more then 5 1/2 feet deep We then continued upstream a shortways when we came across three distinct footprints  Was I dreaming?  No, because there, in the loose dirt, I saw a couple of huge, human-like, barefooted tracks where it had crossed the fire line It looked like it was running on the hind legs and was using its massive arms,leaning forward, to pull itself along It was dark so we just glanced back but of course saw nothing  They also told me that there was someone at that office who takes reports on possible bigfoot happenings and I left my name and number but never heard from anyone The right side of the road had thick brush which at that time appeared to be about 3 feet tall As I left the second blind/upsidown tree working my way up and to the left I saw the silhouette of a bipedal primate about 8 feet tall standing still looking at me Our intent was to get out of the pickup (leaving the dog inside), get on our rain gear and set up the tent as quickly as possible, as it was already quite dark and raining In February, 1981, I happened to be at the right place at the right time to meet a young Indian who talked openly of his interest in Bigfoot and said he had seen him on his reservation and knew the location of caves where Bigfoot hid, and he would take me there - now! He guided me up a fearfully storm-wrecked road I set up my camp directly next to the pool and also with the treeline and some very dense woods about 6 feet away to the north  He was totally smooth The hair on the back of my neck stood up and my son asked me if that was a monkey and I, not wanting to deal with a panicked 7 year old, told him it was just an owl He told me that he thought he had seen Bigfoot while walking home from his bus stop After taking pictures of several different foot prints with a tape measurer, we started to look around for other sign At first I thought it must've been a backpacker, as it was obviously bipedal by the rhythm of the walk Later that evening, as we were sitting around the campfire, I noticed a pair of red eyes looking at me from near the horse corral There it was ""Bigfoot""! At its closest point we were 10 UNOBSTRUCTED FEET FROM IT! EYE TO EYE! Immediately after the snap there was a commotion as some of my nearby items (gas cans and trailer dolly) fell from their spot behind an old wooden shed about 35 feet from me, and something very large moved through the trees for about 30 feet and stopped  Then again, we heard that bellowing howl, and saw on top of the ridge a dark silhouette that looked like a bear standing on its hind feet I remember seeing the fear in his eyes, and I was already scared, so it was unanimous  The top was about the size of a football field It was only about 12 feet away from me  Bigfoot did not even enter my mind It was dusk, so we donned packs and got up the trail as far as we could before it got completely dark To the best of my ability, this is what we heard: Loud, clear, not-shrill sounding (to me, the Puyallup calls sound somewhat metallic and shrill), medium-range, and smooth sounds  The next morning I got up and decided I had to go to the bathroom no matter what was there!  When  got to the outhouse I realized that the eyes I saw reflected back at me had stood about 7 to 8 feet off the ground  I'm sure my hair was standing on end  I was going slow enough through the turn to see his fingers, toes and palms and foot bottoms as he walked but his hair was like a Llama- matted looking but long and, longer and shorter on different parts of his body I just stood there looking at him and then I said to my cousin jimmy, who was about 10 to 15 feet away from me, “look” and pointed at it Between Grant Grove and Cherry Gap on highway 180, when we came around a corner and our headlights lit up the straight away and next corner about 100 yards away and at the next corner we saw a large hairy figure walking upright as it stepped onto the road at an angle towards us and it took large strides and crossed the road and went down the embankment  We continued to hear it for a while, when suddenly it dawned on both of us that we were at 9000 feet in elevation, and there are no trains for about 70 miles 3 inches long and 2 inches wide -light and dark brown mottled One story that I repeatedly heard in particular was how people would pull over in the middle of the night, believing that the wailing that they were hearing was a siren on a police car, only to find themselves alone in the dark night The hair stood up on my neck when I read this due to the similarities with my experience  it had very long, shagy red hair and it was running on all fours It stood there for about one minute oblivious to me it then slowly turned around and started walking right at me it got within five feet of me then I flinched my arm so it would see me before it walked into me, it startled it so bad the deer fell down on its side did a spin on the ground and jumped up and ran the other way when it got around the tree and down about twenty yards I heard that noise again I was looking off to my right hand side and clearly saw something that was all black and bipedal walking parallel with me about 15 yards away Many were at very close range, within a few yards - much too close, but onto my only bigfoot sighting  It was dark about 9:00 at night and the stars were out bright It is a fact and because of it, I know for sure that Bigfoot lives or at least once lived in the area of Green Valley California. Sardella, with Deputies William Huntley and Pete DeMott, returned to the area this morning and spotted additional footprints The cabin is about six to eight feet off the ground and the only way in is by using wooden stairs to climb into it This is on the edge of the Trinity Mountains (Big Foot Country), and about 25 miles into the woods, behind Clair Engle Lake The bridge sagged, and I jumped up and down, stomping my feet, and shouting He heard the stomping and crashing of the brush, and turned to see a large, dark-brown head above the bushes moving rapidly away from him It is pretty cold out side so I'm about to go in side when I heard something that made my skin crawl, and my hair stand on end Its back was to me when it stood so I could see it was built similar to a human but with a lot of hair At the elbow, the hair end and the actual elbow was covered with skin like leather that was black This creek ran down the ledge and off a cliff that is about a 200 feet drop to a boulder field below and about 800 feet (or more) down to the Wooley Creek drainage Then one day several years later, I happened to be in the barber shop, getting a haircut It must have been 8 feet tall or more, and for a 10 year old boy this was unreal  I slowly sat down again and listened to its rustling footsteps as the huge “ape-man” descended down the hill away from me  The footprints were about 18 inches long and (although we did not measure them) approximately 40 inches apart To be more specific of the time, it was just beginning to get dark or dusky It was standing upright as it moved behind a tree, when it moved there was another pair of red glowing eyes but much smaller, I must rephrase and say shorter than the original outline. Was hiking/running the Stuart Fork trail (Trinity Alps)yesterday, and came upon about a dozen footprints right where the trail enters Morris Meadows  It was standing on two legs, was about 7 and one half feet tall, and was 4 feet wide at the shoulders"
Colorado," I did not consider it to be a Bigfoot until I heard a recording of what was thought to be a Bigfoot on a cable TV special aired this summer in July My boyfriend came back, saying it was getting too dark to fish I was driving down the highway in a tractor-trailer rig about 3:30a.m.I was driving about 65 mph.I went around a corner and on the left side of the road I saw something that at first I thought was a deer.This thing than stood upright and seemed to be more than 7 feet tall.I was able to look at it for just a moment as I was driving by.It had wide shoulders and an ape-like face.It's eyes were yellow like a cat's eyes when you shine a light on them.It just kind of looked at me when I went by.I wasn't able to see anything else.  We swung the spotlight around the area just in time to catch a glimpse of a dark primate, about 7 - 8 feet tall, cross in front of the aforementioned boulder and disappear into the dense forest behind the meadow  Giant footprints like that are hard to argue with  The print had what appeared to be a clear heel line, foot shape, ball print and toe marks I saw the glare of its eyes at least three times Some of the shows had taped sound of what they said was BIGFOOT Now it is a little darker and you can't quite see details across the lake but you can still see  It must have been at least 6 feet tall I only saw it swing its arms, it was not carrying anything It appeared to be man-like and covered with dark, reddish brown hair We took off after it, on foot  I do not recall seeing any distinct outline of arms in the very brief time this happened  It sounded like something very big with very long legs stepping through the brush, and it was coming right towards the truck What I saw, I don't know for sure, but it appeared to be walking upright on its hind legs and and was covering a great deal of ground in a short span of time but was not running I also heard water splashing, it was getting dark and I looked all over the beaver pond through binos and could see nothing moving so we left  But he thinks it was a bigfoot it was large and dark colored I am a professional driver and i drive for a living There wasn't much chatter but it was close, right down by my feet The fence came up to what I can only guess was its waist witch  I figure would put it about 8' to 8'5"" tall, gigantic shoulders and a thin waist like you would expect on a bodybuilder I realized that I was encountering something few people have the opportunity to see, at only a distance of about 10 feet. We commented to each other that as strange as it seems it was a bigfoot. ""But sure enough, there was this head looking at us.'' He said since it was dark, few details were visible, but he described it as ""like a coconut.'' ""We freaked out, so we ran into mom's bedroom and grabbed the .22 and loaded it with bullets Even in the darkest woods, I’ve always been comfortable; it’s just the same beautiful forest with the lights turned off, right? But tonight, I’m truly unnerved It made my hair stand on end After I watched it pass, I closed the curtain (this episode lasted about 20-30 seconds) and then it occurred to me it had resembled images of what I have been informed about regarding sightings of Bigfoot  The animal was standing on two legs and was slightly crouched, it appeared to be staring across the lake Then as they got farther away I looked back and it was on two feet and was moving in a flash My family was hiking in RMNP and came across a footprint  on Green Mountain trail I have always considered this a possible bigfoot sighting. The animal was covered with shiny, dark hair that was approximately 3-4"" long and was somewhat shorter in the face area  This print had more definition of the heel print, arch and ball print, indicated flexibility due to a sharp rock that would have been near the center of the foot, and had five very distinct toe marks This creature was tall considering we had been about 4-500 hundred feet away in the car  The ground on the trail was getting progressively harder and more stoney, but this appeared to be a left foot again I can't imagine any reason any person would be up on that ridge, at that time of night, in the dark, in the cold, just waiting for the possible chance that someone would stop at that staging area and get out of their vehicle so they could hoax them with a wood knock My eyes were glued to it and I watched its every move I didn’t really know what a bigfoot would sound like so I started searching google for “bigfoot sounds” That's when I came across this video I initially took the whole event in a rather non-serious way, even though I have been a real student of Bigfoot stories and research for sometime, especially during my teens and early twenties They seemed to go straight across the top of the foot in a straight line but only three were visible Honestly, the thought now that we might have seen footprints of a large animal such as Bigfoot is quite unsettling, and made me uneasy at night, both while in the cabin near Vallecitos, and even at my home in Rio Rancho, near Albuquerque I had heard a Mountain Lion screem and that will make hair stand up on the back of your neck But as they got closer, they saw it was a huge foot similar to a man's without shoes on I saw a very dark object squatting beside the beaver pond All I know is that what ever I saw was not a person and was not a bear (I have seen those go up on two legs before), I only know that I am not sure what it was I saw Eight feet from toe to heel in order left right left right  It was definitely very big and had long legs (much bigger than an elk, and not a bear) I never really told too many people about this but after watching a bigfoot special on tv about a year later I realized I wasnt the only one to ever see something like that in this area.  I walked slowly (15 or 20 feet to my car) to the drivers side of my car watching the ""bear"" in the woods I thought it was odd that somebody would be out walking around that night before barefooted and in the mud  Loud footsteps had been heard on their front stoop I've always believed in bigfoots, but my boyfriend has always been skeptical (even despite the visual sightings by his step-dad, his friend, and his own odd experiences) About 3 or 4 feet further along the trail (heading back ENE) we found a third print that was not as easy to distinguish but which approximately matched the distance from the first to second print and was again similar in size It effortlessly took a few long strides and cleared the entire width of the road I really ever heard of ""bigfoot"" or paid to much attention to it before 11,500 feet   While pondering my dilemma, I hear footsteps and trickling beads of gravel dancing down the face of a rocky overhang directly behind me We followed FR 578 until the trail terminates at a berm installed on a spur of FR 578, presumably installed to close the trail to motorized traffic  The arms were clearly visible as were the legs, but it moved very fast between the trees I had heard bigfoot stories like everyone else but never thought about it or gave them much credit I ask my brother to look at this with the field glasses and I then look at it for several minutes as well as my brother.It looked to be about 7 to 8 ft tall and I estimated about 350 to 400 lbs There is no bigfoot hunting around here  We also heard heavy footsteps crushing the sagebrush What I saw is best described as a large, hairy bipedal animal that had features of both a man and an ape  I was driving and had my eyes pretty much on the road itself when my husband began stuttering and finally got out, ""Stop 7 to 9 feet tall walking just behind the tree line at about 50 to 100 yards I'd say it was about a half mile from me, and 1000 or so feet downhill, so I couldn't get a really good guage on how big it was It was standing upright and took about four steps from the embankment to the other side of the 2 lane highway and paused slightly in front of a 12 foot or taller big yellow diamond shaped sign that warns of the slide area ahead  I asked them to estimate its height but they didn't know other than it seemed to be a lot taller than them When they returned from their hike (about 3 PM), my sister (age 28) reported that she had noticed what she thought looked like a large bare human footprint on a closed portion of trail, approximately ¼ mile WSW from the berm But I could clearly hear loud footsteps crunching through the underbrush, about 100 to 150 feet away It was left a mystery until today's Denver Post arrived with an article on bigfoot displaying the same footprint we examined on Dec After walking about ten more feet, I tripped in a deep hole in the snow that the snowshoers had left with their poles She said it looked like bigfoot I would say it had to be 8 to 10 feet tall to be looking in like that.'' Witness stated at that time, he could see the animal looking in the window We figured it was around 8 feet tall.  It was probably ten to fifteen feet off the road I didn't recignize the noise and the hair on the back of my neck was standing up so I decided to leave  As we got there we stopped around the corner (just before the point in which my friends saw the shoulder move) to see if we could find footprints or anything out of the ordinary We were sitting at our dining room table eating a late-night snack when suddenly this very loud, frightening human/animal-like cry came from about 200 feet from our front door  I estimate we were at approximately 11,500 to 12,000 feet, near the timberline Having been interested in the Bigfoot phenomenon for some time, I though she might be pulling my leg but I took my video camera and we walked down the path together, looking for where she thought she had seen the footprint  I was about 100 feet south from my car, which was out of sight around the outcrop With only a few miles to go we were in total darkness along a trail As soon as I saw this, I began looking around, scanning the tree line (about 40 feet away from where the car was parked) Its arms were shorter than its legs and it was covered with hair Over the next week, after we got back home, I couldn't shake both the question of what those noises were and was there a possibility that it was a bigfoot It then walked on two legs very briskly to the right, subsequently out of my view It walked next to a chain link fence aproximately 6-7 feet in height topped by  three strands of barbed wire and this thing's shoulders were even with the top of this fence  Its hair was golden brown in color and very long I was puzzled at first, thinking, ""Who in their right mind would be outside in this weather, walking in the deep snow (about 1/2 foot or so deep) outside past the lighted basement of this cabin? The figure emerged from the right side of the cabin and was heading to the left side, which would have been toward the direction of the road and the next set of cabins (about 50 or more yards away) It was very tall, at least eight feet also submitted a report of the track find to the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization via their web site (BFRO.net), upon the recommendation of Sergeant Kaufman  As we were going around the corner for hole 13 (it backs up to Roxborough State Park), out of the corner of our eyes we saw this huge whitish grey figure that was clearly distinguished as a large human like figure  Its height made it look like a bear reared up on its hind legs This thing was so tall that it stood at least a foot and half above the rack on the roof of my Jeep Grand Cherokee He said it took him time to put everything together, the crashing, the growling, the thing not leaving, the giant footprints, the uneasiness We did find a few footprints, but didn't have any plaster to make a mold The crunching footsteps continued moving away, when after 20 or 30 seconds, the animal made another loud bark, exactly like the first We watched the boxing match and after it was over we started to head back to Pagosa Springs on Cromo Rd and we were almost to Highway 84 when about 20 yards in front of us this thing or big foot crossed and went quickly, almost as if we were seeing things   Unbelievably, I again hear the pacing of heavy footsteps on the wooded flat rising behind camp If they do spread out, maybe someone just walked through there barefooted  The thing that really sticks out about it was the long arms that hung nearly to the knees but it didn't lumber or swing it's arms like an ape does, although the arms did swing  I was driving south down from the mountain on my regular route I had my high beams on because its dark in that area  My son insisted that it had a tuft of snow white hair on its head Not being trained trackers, we found no evidence the next day, but our son, who is now almost 35, swears to this day, that it was Bigfoot that he saw It took off running and we didn't see it after that.'' The two called the sheriff, who came to investigate and found the two bullet holes in the window, but no blood and no footprints on the hard adobe ground I must admit I have always been skeptical about bigfoot until now  The area is along the [edited] at about 10,000 feet We went with a yard stick which is all we had to try and at least measure the foot print what is that?""  We observed a large, black animal on two feet, just like a man, walking through a clearing of pine trees toward the mountain side which was away from any roads Most of the rest of the soil in this area is too rocky to see the tracks of soft footed animals well  The body was muscular, with a thin waist and easily discernible definition, and the arms were long, hanging below the level of the hips  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight I was hunting in a remote camp that is a 1/2 days pack in on foot I think it was during the second  autumn there, so it would have been 1971, our then 5 1/2 yr old son claimed he heard the sound of footsteps in the early evening after hearing a really strange sound - definitely animal, but he had no words at that age to describe it Fifteen yards into dense willows, I again detect footfalls, seemingly paralleling me It just stood there on two legs looking straight at us His face was darker and did almost look human I don’t recall seeing any hair or fur No one believed me of course, but I can still see his eyes looking at me before he turned Also, the footsteps sounded as if made by a bipedal animal, but bears don't walk on two legs.  From the dark timber near our camp, we were now approximately 500 yards away and a couple hundred feet higher in elevation  Standing in the blackness of heavy canopy, I hear the crunching leaves from circling footfalls that tell me this time might be different I believed, for sure, at that time that bigfoot were in the area The elevation of this area is just over 10,000 feet  The eyes were dark and the nose was flat and wide It was across the lake maybe half a mile, walking slow but was moving at a fast pace, its arm movements and stride looked normal to be going that fast  We took our sport camera and tried to take pictures of the animal but it was about 40 feet up a hillside  The animal's eyes appeared below a slightly sloping forehead and there may have been a brow ridge Someone should walk through the summer snow patches barefooted and then observe the prints for a number of days during the summer when this melt/refreeze procees occurs I realized at this time that this must be the bigfoot of legend, but I had thought that they lived in the Pacific Northwest and were probably a myth, I certainly had never heard any reports of sightings in Colorado In my opinion, it was not a bear, elk, deer, cow or any other four legged animal as it was running on two legs with arms about two feet from the ground  Even though I had a .357 loaded with hot hollow points and a strong flashlight, the prospect of encountering some big, hairy “man-thing” outside my tent in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere, and alone, was a little more than I wanted to deal with He described it as ""large, hairy and black.'' ""My friend fired two shots at it, but missed  We went to bed in the tent just at dark I do always keep my eyes open when we visit the mountains or wooded areas, but this is my first experience of anything that I would contribute in any way to bigfoot  When I opened the truck door, it turned, bent over and picked something up and began to run on two legs across the meadow away from me  It was about 6.5 feet tall, covered in light brown fur, had large fox-like ears, and large, black, globe-shaped eyes My 13 year old nephew looked at my husband and myself and said "" Boy I never seen a bear running on it's hind legs before, and running that fast."" My husband is not a firm believer in the unknown but I swear to what I saw was no kind of black bear or animal that I ever saw before It’s a long, mentally exhausting hike back to camp That side was two plywood sections high, which would have put it a hair over 16' We could still make out the silhouette of the mountain against the backdrop of the sky, but it was too dark to make out any individual trees It stood on two legs at all times and sometimes it rocked back and forth I noticed at that time that a herd of elk had come on to the path from the right, some time that night after it rained and followed the path for approximately 50 feet It was about 100 feet to my left on the valley floor  What I saw was not the same as what I've seen in photos, however, what I saw was a bipedal creature with white fur  A large boulder, at least 15 feet tall, was in the middle of the meadow The next day after getting my clients to the airport I returned on foot and was shocked to find a track, I placed my foot beside it and it was at least another 8 to 10"" past my boot  At first we thought it was my brother messing with us, he was the only one in our group tall enough It was very tall and from what I could see the head was large and long, the shoulder span was very wide  Next few days, found and photographed two footprints I just stared because to the left of me I saw the silouette of a tall two legged creature through the door( we had zipped up the screen and left the cover off ) Beside me was a long window (at least 3' long and 6"" tall) that had these little curtains hanging from them What I first thought to be a person was coming toward me along the edge of the cliff from the direction of the promontory and was about 100 feet away It was about 20 feet in the woods watching and the car was between us  I briefly thought about following the animal or looking for some good footprints to show the appropriate authorities, but I was alone and the animal was big, I would conservatively guess it was around 7 feet tall and weighed over 300 pounds, so I left and hiked quickly out of the area, not slowing down until I got to my truck They had run a little ways ahead of me and I was just admiring the view when off in the tree line about half way up the trail I noticed a large hairy figure approx He was very large probably eight feet tall and had long greying hair There is no question that it was bipedal; not once did I see it move quadrapedally I don’t know if there were more than one of these things breathing heavily by the window but I could hear the breathing down by one end of the window by my feet, and then closer by my head The ""roar"" can best be described as being almost exactly that (sound, duration, pausing) which is currently found on this website, listed as a potential Bigfoot ""howl"" recorded in Ohio   The pistol is an enormous confidence builder, and wanting to get to the bottom of this, I rush the bench only to hear heavy footsteps dash off through breaking brush Cabin at 11,000 feet southwest of Fairplay, Colorado, 44 acres It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up There was a light on somewhere outside, enough for me to see more than just darkness Its color was black and brown mixed and its fur or hair was thick and matted in spots He went over to the stream to fish, and I started to eat my soup in my camp chair The area around the footprint was very rough. I have watched shows on TV about BIGFOOT since  No human could run that fast,  especially across that rugged mountain, and it was at least seven feet tall Its skin was dark brown or black and was the same shade around the eyes, nose and lower forehead The bigfoot was in motion, black, and was quickly out of sight This car was in front of us by about 25 feet When he spoke of it he said it was on two legs and taller than any animal he had ever seen  I watched the media for any unusual reports of bigfoot-type animals in Colorado in the months and years after my sighting and a few reports did indeed trickle in Coming around a bend in the trail a creature standing at least 7 foot tall and covered in dark hair crossed the trail not twenty feet infront of me In 1971 I saw some very large footprints in the snow in the summer high in a Colorado wilderness area I was expecting or hoping to see nothing outside, but I saw a pair of brown eyes just inches from my face staring right back at me  There clearly was nothing between our position and the dark timber where our camp was located  The creature was partially bipedal and then would stoop like an ape and touch the ground  There are always some crazy sightings of UFO's and Bigfoot sightings Its eyes were set somewhat back from the eyebrow ridge and where ones check bones would be I was so startled that I just stood there frozen as this dark figure was staring back at me It was a year or two later and my wife and I were looking at a bigfoot page on the net and found recordings of what is believed to be a bigfoot In the distance I saw a large dark object running into the woods  Having had several days now to think about this event, and to have gauged the reactions of the few folks I have told about our observations, I am still not exactly sure what we saw and what I taped, but it definitely appears to be large humanoid footprints, made in varying terrain, showing a 3 to 4 foot gait and a foot that is somewhere near 14 or 15 inches long and about 6 or 7 inches wide Very dark body with a large head and huge hands Foot prints were not descriptive of toes, arch heel The biped was unable to climb up over 20 feet, moved back down laterally to its right, and then down to the ground off the snow We finished loading about dark, and as we started to leave, it came a downpour, so I was coming down off the mountain about 5 to 10 mph To describe the eyes without being too anthropomorphic - the eyes did not have a cold or lifeless appearance but rather a stunned but processing appearance. 7 feet to 7 1/2 feet tall  A bear's front legs hang in front of their belly when they stand and these did not Having seen these prints with my own eyes, I definitely believe it is possible At night we all played games like glow in the dark dodgeball or went inside the cafeteria to play telephone or mystery date The weather was not good as it was snowing and dark out It was clearly upright on two feet, which at that point both of us looked at each other wide eyed, like we couldn't really register what we've just saw To my surprise I discovered that not only does the area have many reports of bigfoot sightings and encounters but that it is listed as one of the top 10 places to encounter bigfoot in the United States There were no other lights on at the time, but the snow held its own illumination in the dark   To this day me and my cousins swear we saw a bigfoot. When it ran I could see its whipsy hair in the moonlight, but I couldent make out a color  He finally told me that he had found big footprints by the stream, in the mud  So, you come up over the burm from the trail and reach the plateau where you can see the entire beaver pond, it was only about 50-75 feet across, and the edge of the pond was surrounded by a fairly good amount of open land, when I would go there, I remember about 10-30 feet of grass between the pond and the trees As we continued towards the Jeeps, we found another print, much more clear than the previous print about 3½ to 4 feet away At that time my friends dogs that were sleeping in his tent about 100 feet from our camper strated to bark I am not a great outdoorsman but I am aware that some bear prints can appear almost human, but the video shows what I believe to have been clear human or humanoid footprints with no evidence of claws as on a bear  Only if this was a person, he was really tall In full disclosure, I am a bigfoot enthusiast  It also took very huge strides but in no way acted like it was in a hurry It had very long hair on its arms I examined the print by placing my foot next to it  He said they were huge, much bigger than his print, and much deeper (the thing would have to have a large foot and be extremely heavy) These prints were at least half again as big as a big human foot and the stride length was much longer than any human -- at least 4 feet or longer  Some of the signs were over 8 foot off the ground to the top yet they had been torn down with apparent ease I looked up, and at the top of a sheer rock wall about thirty feet up, I saw him By this time the heavy breathing and “chatter” had been going on for several minutes and I was frozen with fear, the hair on my arms standing on end and unable to utter a word We observed the creature about two hundred feet above the highway on a ridge-line ofver looking the road What happened next is still very vivid in my mind: My co-worker said ""do something"" so I yelled ""HEY!"" It never broke stride but it turned its head and looked right at me Shouting threats into the darkness, I’m hoping to make it clear to this interloper exactly who this elk meat belongs to They told me what happened and I instantly thought of bigfoot pushing over a tree in the woods up from the lake The legs were long and it bent at the knees like a human When I slammed the car door it stood up about 7-8 feet tall (it looked like a large, dark man covered in black fur) I started my car as soon as it got up and did not watch it continuously as it ran, but did see it for about three seconds  If I had to make a guess at the height I would say 7 feet or a little more It is now dark and headlights the only lights besides the stars The creature was a light to a medium brown and had shaggy long hair, it stood about 7 feet tall  This print appeared to be a right foot  At first we joked about how it looked like a bigfoot creature, but blew it off as my brother  Initially we though it must be an elk or deer, but looking at the spacing of the tracks they appeared to be created by a bi-pedal creature with a gate much larger than I could span (I am a little over 6 foot tall)  The tracks appeared to have the basic shape of a human foot and toe impressions could be faintly seen in a couple of the tracks  My boyfriend wanted to get some fishing in before it got too dark i did not have Bigfoot on my mind AT ALL prior to this incident  It was about 50 feet in front of us It looked like a very large, hairy, naked person with a powerful build, broad shoulders, and a relatively small, pointed or bullet-shaped head A metallic clang of the .38-barrel striking a Sierra Cup announces my approach to any lingering scavengers The figure had long legs, and was mostly all legs What I saw was hairy from head to toe, very thick with broad shoulders and lacked the long snout and round rump that bears have.  The print appeared to be a left foot  What I saw in those few moments was definitely humanoid or bipedal, whatever you want to call it The creature was again around 7 foot tall maybe taller but not much.And it had short dark brown almost a reddish coat On Dec, 20, 2000, my wife and daughter were walking along (withheld) Road when they spotted two large footprints in the snow about five feet off the road a quarter mile from our cabin The time of day was early morning about 5:30 in the morning, dark and little or no moon Though the idea of bigfoot was in the back of my mind that second night, for whatever reason my logical side wanted to explain it off as some assholes playing games in the woods I was so scared and astonished at what I was looking at I could not move.Then suddenly it turned and ran with a huge stride and it was fast I'm crouched about 5 feet from first base and the bushes were moving over by third base When we pulled up our binoculars we realized that it was an unusually tall, dark, hairy creature with exceptionally long arms and a very long stride I live in Denver, Colorado and I may have seen a bigfoot when I was in college in Boulder, Colorado several years ago As the sun went down, we left Deer Lakes but drove further away from the highway, waiting until it got very dark before we went back to town so we could se the stars really well  We immediately drove to the spot where we had seen the creature and checked for footprints  We both concluded it was likely a bigfoot 2 years ago i was driving on us highway #160 in colorado in between durango and cortez colorado i was going eastbound  (towards durango)and i saw something run across the road very rapidly from my right(south) to my left(north) on 2 legs  I know it was still dark outside I didn't know what to think, so I asked Sammy if he saw it, and he said, What was that?  We got up to where it crossed and I opened my door to look down on the road and saw a foot print and Sammy opened his door and saw a track too The stride of this figure was very deliberate and determined  The bushes near the stream were very tall and thick, and I couldn't see my boyfriend at all  I told him that I had not been, and then jokingly commented that bigfoots are   said to make sounds like that  By the time my husband and I snapped out of our daze it was gone and the really frustrating thing about it too, is that we had a camcorder right by our sides and neither of us even thought to grab it!  I'm a really bad judge of distance but I would guess it was a little over 100 feet away from us when we saw it. A large human-like footprint by Helmets Peak It continued it's stride while keeping eye contact When he looked up through the open shutter window  - he said he looked right into the face of a ""monster."" All I know for sure is that I'll certainly never forget his terrified screams! When he calmed down, he described it as dark and very hairy and a ""funny"" face and glowing eyes; it turned and ran away as soon as he started screaming  On my return to camp I cut a set of tracks that looked like a big barefoot person had passed by It was slightly leaning forward and its arms were swinging In the silence following the final roar, I felt the hair on the back of my neck stand on end and uttered the only thing that came to mind at that point We were driving and observed a hairy animal run across the road But, I could tell that the face was very dark I shouted, ""Dad, look!"" as I saw what I immediately believed to be a bigfoot 100 feet behind him I got to looking at the track closer and noticed that on top of the elk track were a set of large 16"" barefoot prints following the elk My dad did not turn around and look at the bigfoot, because he wanted to take my picture It crossed the highway in a smooth fluid motion, paying no mind to the vehicles coming in either direction.It crossed the road in three or four strides, then disappeared of to the west side of the road  The animal was huge and the arms appeared very long as opposed to a person's The trail I was on kind of funnels into the lake, and as the lake came into view I noticed a large, dark  animal about 20 yards to my right near a boulder However, what sealed it as a bigfoot for me happened later that night The creatures were jet black and you could see the arms and legs, torso and head We were not sure what it was that night but after talking about the incident quite a bit, we think we had a Bigfoot encounter We were up in the basin and Helen had gone ahead to the foot of the basin Possible footprint observation, FR 578 near Hermosa Peak, Dolores County Colorado, Friday, June 20, 2003 We were staying in a cabin northeast of Vallecitos on Middle Mountain, just off of FR 724 It walked on two legs and was out of sight in two or three steps, but what amazed me was that it didn't make any noise as it disappeared into the very steep valley below With the ground sharply slanted up, we figured something would have had to have been just about 7-8' tall to peer into that upper window One odd thing I noticed about this ""thing"" was it had long reddish brown hair from head to toe and it didn't seem to have a neck I’m not sure what I’m up against, but something tells me it’s time to back away and leave the elk to whatever it is that’s skulking in the darkness I am of course no expert in zoology or cryptolgy [sic] but from my best guess and knowing what I have seen from the past I think that my hunting party and I disturbed a bigfoot while hunting that morning We had gone about a half a mile when my uncle and I spotted both something that looked like a dead, burned tree stump that was about 7 to 8 feet tall Then it walked a few more feet and turned next to a fence and walked past a car wash and storage unit and out of sight It was not yet pitch dark It was walking upright and took long strides If the enlarging of the prints and spreading of the stride does not occur, I assume these prints I saw were not human  The face was dark and the lips appeared thin I would estimate its height to be maybe 6 foot  Maybe about 7-8 feet tall I could hear the heavy pounding of its large foot steps Its very rural when all of sudden a large up right dark figure stepped out into the road I stopped and watch it cross the road in three steps This lake is well above treeline, 13,000 ft area? Found what appears to to be a footprint in some mossy areas between the glacial rocks As we neared the spot where the droppings were I spotted a  single foot print on the uphill side partly hidden by branches  He asked him again, "" what do you see?""  He cousin seemed very up- set and said, "" I'm not gonna tell you, I know, you'll just make fun of me."" After more prodding he said, "" I think I just saw bigfoot""  It was covered with long dark brown hair that made me think of a yak The next night we broke camp about an hour before dark, and once more everything became deathly quiet again, and the feeling like we were being watched I asked the ranger who would be out there barefooted in this temperature So we could possibly have had two bigfoot encounters at or near Deer Lakes We were in a 4x4 pick up and I guessed this thing to be about 7 to 8 feet tall when that thing stood in front of the yellow sign on that white post at first I thought it was a huge bear and then relized that bears do not travel around on 2 legs and 10 to 11 foot tall bears are not in exsistence in that area I am six foot tall and could not even match the stride It had long beige hair, approx 6"" long, and a dark area around the face and elbows There have been so many sightings in the area that the nearby town of Bailey has since placed bigfoot crossing signs along their small town roads One of the more drunken members of the group started walking and shouting towards where the vocalization had eminated - he later stated that he was 'trying to communicate' - when a few of the people at close range saw what was described as 'a very tall, very powerful ape-like creature' moving at first into the clearing, and then away from the camp at great speed  As we topped the ridge we saw a large dark brown animal squatting at the edge of a dry creek bed with it's back toward us  The ground was covered in pine needles (except the road area and a creek bed about twenty of thirty yards away.)  We both stood by the large rock and realized the ""creature"" had to have been 7 to 7-1/2 feet tall because the top of the rock was at the level of our chests  (he and I are 5'10"" tall)  My mom, being in the back did not see it until the bike spun around and she slid off the back onto her feet  It was on two legs, tall and covered in hair  The ""arms"" hung to the sides just like a person about like a man's walk but I guess the arms were more noticable because they were so long I lived for about 7 years in Leadville back in the 1970’s and that town has a long history of Bigfoot reports  I started catching glimpses of a large, hairy, brown and black animal and thought we were following a bear At first we thought it was a grizzly bear since it stood on its hind legs watching us from a distance of about 300 feet i stood very still and never took my eyes off of it.after about seven or eight minutes it turned and simply walked off down the hill.i will add that i am a 30 year archery hunter, and have succesfully tagged bears in this same unit My uncle went the same direction as the bigfoot, and I went the other way in case it double-backed on us About 20-25 minutes later I was in the kitchen area when my co-worker screamed ""GET OUT HERE QUICK."" So I headed to the front just in time to see a very large hairy looking thing just walking down the street right under a light as casual as could be Anyway as I am on the first straight away I could clearly see across to the second straight away when I saw movement up on this high embankment to the left on the second straight away about fifty feet above the highway and moving down the almost eighty foot tall and almost vertical embankment  He squinted his eyes and leaned forward to concentrate on something he saw  At first I was not even going to go down to the area were I and a friend saw a bigfoot That night the kids went to bed as soon as it got dark  There was nothing that specifically proved it was a Bigfoot standing in those trees watching us drive by, but my son and I have no doubt that it was. He laughed and said bigfoot. It was on 2 legs and running really fast Just as I was about to close the curtain, I saw a very tall, rather large, dark figure stride past the entirely of the basement, across the snow At 50 yards I spot the bigfoot The only thing missing from the encounter was the lack of the famous Bigfoot stench Dirt was left on the road in a bare foot form with 5 toes.  Probably at least 7' tall My girlfriend's eyes got very wide, and she whispered to me that she had no idea what kind of animal made that noise This sound was so primal, so intense, so big, that it raised the hair on my arms and the back of my neck, and I was chilled as I have never been before in the wilderness Because of its height, gait and posture, slightly slouched forward above mid back,  and its dark multi coloring I always believed that I saw a bigfoot  A deer or elk would have left long dragging skids through snow this deep, but there was no dragging, just deep, large, single steps that would look just like a humans gait, except maybe a foot more between each step We were all enjoying viewing the Colorado River when we all four noticed something tall thin and hairy walking in the middle of the river"
Connecticut,"“It sounds like footsteps…” I continued At the Burlington Bristol Townline in Connecticut there was a woodsy area behind a Cumberland Farms store we used to go up there camping or have cake parties He was walking north with the back of his hands facing forward, swaying like a gorilla as he walked on two legs Place: New Preston, CT.,  hillside Lake Waramog, Date: 2/16/15 Saw: Looking over lake from riding in a car on RT.45 the hillside saw a black tall figure just walking along so easily, the figure crossed a driveway from the forest to the other side and continued slouching along swinging arms heading towards powerlines approximately 800 yrds away 2 legs definitely..made a very big ruckus coming through woods.. I believe the prints were of a two-legged creature with a foot size of at least 15 inches. bigfoot crossed in front of us . When we reached the spot, I looked down towards the direction we had heard the footsteps It was dark brown .  Never did we ever consider it being a big foot I put dollar bills down to document the size, I also believe that the stride was at least 5 feet between two of the prints  He sprinted down the road without me and I had no choice but to follow him since I lost sight of him in the dark It had a cone shaped head, no neck, a slim looking body, very black hair, swinging arm was very long, legs seemed shorter In a clearing of the woods I saw what looked to be an extremely tall man with shoulder length dirty blonde hair It looked to be around 5 ft tall I found and photographed three-footprints following a stream This event took place BEFORE there was ever a mention of anything like Bigfoot, especially in this area. I estimate aroud 7/1/2 - 8ft ft tall.After the incident I went upstairs and my mother told me the next morning that she felt like she was being watched for about 3 hrs at 3 am in the morning i went out the back door to do my walk around and as i stepped out onto a deck the loudest scream i had every herd made all my hair stand up.it sounded female and was only 100 ft away .i no this becaus right behind the building is a mountain that has a trail that runs parallel with the mountain.i wated till the sun came up and walked to ware the trail was and seen foot prints that i measured to be 18inches long and 5 inches wide..iwent home and check out the scream i herd on youtube and emiedatly i got a hit.it was the same sound i hurd and my hair stood up again.i no this isnt like a sighting but you had to be there to hear it In the early 2000s she decided to install 12’ ft fencing around the property, although it only encloses about 80 acres of the land she owns tall and very wide from the side. I had a few favorite spots, and one was up a small foot hill in the deepest part of the woods When I went outside to call the dog in and I saw six or seven deer running like heck like they were being chased, I looked behind them and in the tall grass a large hairy animal was chasing after them running on two legs towering above the grass which was around four feet tall at the time As we were busy picking, a large (6 1/2' to 7' tall) creature came down the steep hillside and proceeded to walk northward along the railroad tracks, staring at the 3 of us once, and moving at a fast walk The hair was shorter than Bigfoots I've seen on TV (Patterson film) and it's body was thinner than those also The body was covered in a dark brown/grayish color hair and it had the face of a primate Then began the sound of footsteps coming from even deeper in the woods It felt as if the woods lay still in wait while these footsteps made their way swiftly up the steep incline towards us As I focused in I realized this 8 ft tall creature’s arms, chest and legs were also covered in the same long dirty blonde hair As we passed him I jumped out of my seat and turned around and kept my eyes locked on him as long as I could This time, the footsteps started almost immediately He said no this was a foot, a really big foot The best way I can explain their location is that it was in a similar spot to the day before, but somewhat more to the right where the forest was very dark and the incline to reach us was less steep It was bipedal and heavy, and was coming up towards us from a steep slope down the side of the mountain/foothill I had a Sasquatch hiding in the bushes in a swamp behind my home from me stalking two Deer, it was less than 20 feet from me...it had an arm 4 Feet long with jet black hair hanging down 3 or 4 inches...I turned To make sure my back door was closed, I turned back and it was gone...We've been hearing whoops and wood knock type sounds all summer. I cant say its Bigfoot but we have something going on here At least once every couple of months we hear knocking and dragging noises against our house and on windows that are approximately 6 and half feet off the ground  It was just not something we even thought of, until years later when we realized oh my God remember that night we went camping !?  That was a bigfoot! We were young and we never even really heard anything about a big foot back then I remember the length of it's stride (about 5') and it's arms which looked like they went almost to it's knees"
Delaware," The thing that initially got my attention was the fact that the corn stalks were now dried and yellow and it appeared that something dark brown was standing there in the middle of the corn stalks I screamed for my wife and told her I believe I just heard a squatch, she rolled her eyes and said if you would stop trying to call them after you watch the show they wouldn't come and then 4 more loud knocks Having an interest in the subject of Bigfoot, I immediately went into observation mode and noted the following:  What I saw was medium to dark brown in color, it was taller than the cornstalks, it appeared to be about 3 feet wide and I may have been looking at a head and shoulders and it definitely wasn't a piece of farm equipment, a scarecrow or a human This couldn't have been 100ft away from me and was so loud that it felt like it was next to me, I don't know if it was the light music playing that had it let me hear it or the practice calling in the rear yard but there are definitly BIG FOOTS IN DELAWARE Then when it got across the road to the field they both said it stood up and it had red eyes  The brown ""thing"" was roughly 300 feet in off the road in the cornfield by itself I just started to watch the television show finding bigfoot and remembered that night and called my brother up again to get the details to see if I remembered it right."

Florida,"The Bigfoot sighter - a Belleview welder who didn't want his name known - said the beast was brown and black As I looked down the trail it was very obvious to me that the eyes were far enough apart and high enough off of the ground to justify being concerned By the time we got back it was dark After about 15 minutes of us staring at it, not believing that we actually are seeing a bigfoot it got up and walked back across the trail being followed by a smaller less intimidating one His face was not as hairy as his body ""I think I just saw it."" Monday morning a security guard for an Apopka nursery told police a 10-foot-tall hairy animal with a chestful of reddish- gray fur and small ears attacked him, ripping off the terrified guard's shirt i saw something running past the trees, it was tall brown and hairy and was running fast  There was a hill going away from the road, and a small area for runoff between the road and the hill that was damp, and in that damp area, we found a large footprint @1"" deep and as I recall about 16-18"" long I was kayaking with a friend in econlockhatchie river in orange county the east side of orlando fl it was 2003 early spring or very late winter my friend was much slower than me so I was having fun suprising these very large alligators that were sunning them selves in the early morning sun.The river is very narrow and has tight winding corners which allowed me to pop around a corner and to my delight most of the time a huge gator would slip into the river silently I would glide over the spot thinking that gator has to be lurking on the bottom.Anyway The wind was light out the west very dry and cool a real treat for a floridian I paddled a ways on a strait with the wind blowing from the woods to the water when I smelled such a strong overwhelming oder musty thick moist pugent smell I never experienced before I looked to see what on eart could it be when I saw big patch of long flowing fur it was shiny and light brown and moving fast then this animal crashed through the woods with so much force that small trees were popping and snapping as it ran away from me and the river then that smell was lingreing over the area and was so strong I finnaly held my breath and had paddle to get some fresh air.I had heard that bigfoot smelled like that but I had no idea they had been reported in fl.Anyway I had watched monster quest for years and not one person ever mentioned the smell I only remember it from seventies on tv when i was very young I never reported this til now because I felt  stupid and confused then after watching tonights episode where 2 different reports described that same smell I felt compelled also the location seemed very odd orlando fl just seemed too odd but internet searches showed many reports I thought that that was very strange as I had seen nor heard any people around at all plus I was wondering why someone was walking around barefoot About 15 feet away there was a large drainage ditch that was about five foot across and four foot deep, someone at one time had placed a log across this ditch in order to cross it We are hoping this thing does not come back as we are living in total darkness out here and will not have our power restored any time soon She slowed down to see if it was a man, of course it wasn't and she thought from a far, it had on a light green arm jacket with long hair, flowing over it, but it wasn't a arm jacket at all I looked over into the other lane and saw this dark man-like figure crossing the road I saw fingers, no hair on the palms because I could see skin, no facial hair At 5 am Feb 9 1998  Heading north on 349 a small redish long haired ape looking creature about 5 foot five-6 foot tall, picking up road kill in the middle of the road ran off in to the woods Then the sound changed and was exactly the same sound as the recording that Matt Moneymaker made in Ohio Valley called Bigfoot Scream which is actually what prompted me to write this It was towards the tree stump...I watched as this stump, which was about 3 to 4 foot tall stand up and double its size.. We all came to the roof edge and observed a tall, hairy creature leaving the basement of the house and walking upright towards the edge of the trees, directly away from us I was traveling kind of fast and could not stop until I was about 10 feet past the road I was flipping threw the channels last week watching some late night TV when I saw a program called Finding Bigfoot.It brought me back to the day my mind about that giant changed for me.I only told my mom what I saw.It really changed my life about the unknown.I was running my airboat on the upper St I do believe stronger today that this was a bigfoot I am 6'6"" tall, and these eyes were level with me, possibly a few inches upward It looked and walked eerily like the famous bigfoot video clip you see everywhere When this thing got about 20 feet from us, a surprising thing happened; the things split (there were two of them) That area of the creek is approximatly 12 feet in width from bank to bank I looked back and I saw bigfoot It had really large hands and it kinda sit on its legs when crouched down there was a musky odor like a deer in rut smell IT WAS AROUND AUGUST, SEE AS THERE WAS A STORM COMING IN, THIS WAS WAS AROUND 1991 ME AND ONE OF MY SIS WAS GOING TO GET THE OTHER ONE, WE WERE TRAVELING ST RD 121 DOWN FROM GOLF CLUB WHEN WE CAME OVER THE HILL THERE WERE FOUR, RANGING FROM 9 FOOT TO7 FOOT AND THE SMALLEST WAS AROUND 5 FOOT  WALKING ACROSS THE ROAD I was out behind my house smoking, walking my dogs around 6:30 pm, just before dark These sounds had to be made by an animal with opposable thumbs; if they were made by humans, they would have had to have been able to navigate one nasty swamp in pitch black dark with the speed and agility of a cat and inour healights about 25yards infront of the truck there was manlike object walking acorss the two lane road it was about 8-9 feet tall and its arms went down to is kneecaps it was really dark but we could see almost all of its side all the guys looked and they became concerned and frightned because there was the distinct outline of a huge man sitting at the base of that tree, plainly outlined sitting on his butt, feet streight out in front of it..Tim said it had huge shoulders and was just eanourmous..he said "" We freaked out and ran like hell"" funny thing is it was again private land and at first they thought it was a warden, but after a few mins they had no idea what it was but became extremely afraid of that massive torso sitting at the base of that tree watching them  (it was a metal door.)  and there were big bare foot prints under the door The further I got the deeper the prints went into the ground and my foot and leg went all the way to my groin area, this thing was BIG I really enjoy your website it also helps me understand that i'm  not crazy , most people would  think and look at me like i'm crazy  when i relatemy encounter, (they don't have any experience outside of the city, they will never understand until  bigfoot hits them over the head, even then they'd deny it The eyes were at least 1 ft Marion County Sheriff Don Moreland chuckled about the Bigfoot report Found footprints in the field As I was trying slowly to back away to get back to my truck I stepped on a stick and it immediately turned to look at me using its whole body to do so and then it ran off caring stick in a graceful stride through the woods. I couldn't see any feet and it was about 1/8 mile away so I didn't see any facial features I caught a quick glimpse of a tall hairy figure standing in woods and then running After about fifteen or twenty seconds (perhaps a dozen footsteps, crunch…crunch…crunch) I remember one of us supposing it was a bear standing up but that was quickly batted down since shoulders were clearly visible, it simply looked like large hairy man All three of us looked out the window to see what appeared to be an 8-10 foot tall hairy being I couldn't make out what it was so I walked up closer when I saw him turn towards me face to face and only about 15 feet away  Anyway as we got closer the figure just seemed to be all dark colored with hair I began to hear what seemed to be footsteps in the woods maybe 5 - 10 yards to my right  Growls, knocks and running on two feet through swamps This made me dismiss the Bigfoot idea We were sitting in the brush and heard a loud crunch, thinking it was a big buck, when my husband and I turned to look about 80 yards out we see a massive human like figure that was covered in meduim longish brown hair looking from behind a large oak tree at the end of a bottom, towards the entrance of a branch head The road that I was on was just wide enough to fit two full-size trucks passing each other, and the swamp monkey, that's what we all called the supposedly made up animal that lived in this area, crossed the road in two strides I had been watching for deer for maybe 30 minutes, when directly in front of me in the thicket maybe 100 feet, sound began to develop  The break was about seven to eight feet in the air I really wish I had my dash camera installed at that point IT STOOD ABOUT 7 TO 8 FOOT HIGH  It was in a cleared area that had probably been controlled burned at some point, so I clearly could see a figure covered with dark brown fur from head to toe When we returned, almost an hour later, we found a tree freshly broken in half, the break being about eight feet from the ground The officer I was talking to turned his head and his eyes got real big Head was missing and front legs were ripped off We also noticed spots where it walked through the tall grass I would say that it was between 6.5 to 7.5 feet tall, muscular but rather skinny, long, shaggy hair about its entire body, with a tan to reddish brown appearance When it jumped down into the embankment the arms went up in the air as to help keep its balance or not hit anything   It was just after dark as we returned back to our camper (grandparents motorhome) from the camp ground fishing pond MY GMC IS CLOSE TO 7 FOOT AT REAR AND THIS WAS HIGHER THEN MY SUV AND TOOK UP HALF OF THE WIDTH OF THE BACK WINDOW HITTING MY TRAILER HITCH MOVING MY SUV He arrived at my house and I asked him to take me back to that spot, when we arrived you can see his skid marks where he slid to try and keep from hitting it, we shined a light into the woods, that's when i seen it, it was at-least 9ft tall and 4ft wide, I myself didn't really believe in bigfoot until I seen it with my own eyes....... Hey guys and Lady, My name is xxx and I have never seen a Bigfoot or Sasquatch I slowed and pulled over, finally stopping my car as I tried to frame what I was seeing in terms I could understand, The “person” walking from the woods was huge, well over 7 feet tall Long arms and large head stood over 6 to 7 feet tall it was on 2 feet, it turned, i went to my knee to brace for a shot if it came toward me The legs looked darker under the knee joints, looking back that was probably cause it was wet went into the woods, whatever it was stayed at least 100-200 feet away from them the face which was covered with short hair  It looked like it could have been about 6 ½ - 7' tall The creature’s hair was black and gray in color and was slicked down against the lighter skin, which could be seen in some places through what appeared to be wet hair So even if a man could don a suit and act like an eight foot tall living creature, how did he manage to walk down a steep embankment that was grassy and wet? Any human would be on his ass or tumble dangerously down that embankment  This thing was a foot taller than a man because the breathing noises I had heard were definately well above my head and I'm 6 feet tall! What I experienced that night was many, many, many more times frightening,...than you can ever imagine There were no footprints because it was walking slightly into the water This animal made the hair on my arms stand on end and chills run down my body Well just over the bridge the road curves slightly then straightens out, I had my high beams on like I always do when I pass a wooded area (I am a strong believer in Bigfoot) to try and catch a glimps of the sasquatch, Well that night it paid off! What I saw was a figure about 8 and a half to 9 feet tall and was hair covered, my light had made his eyes glare and he kinda squinted his eyes a little due to the light I am guessing For some reason, all I could think was “That’s a four foot tall parrot” I was able to get the car turned around in the opposite direction, but when I moved forward about a foot, the car sank deep in the sand My eyes were directly on the animal as it walked, upright, across the rest of the trail and into the palmettos I grabbed all kinds of legos, and after I had grabbed the last lego that I could have possibly held, I sat up straight and there in the window were two piercing red eyes As soon as he said that to my left in the dense tree brush I saw out of the corner of my eye a tall dark figure stand up about 8-9 feet tall (approximation but it was huge) I saw something dark brown, upright and moving very quickly across the row between the trees We jumped into Joe's car and followed the Deputy when the beast stepped out of the darkness and was hit by the police car there was a stink in the air i tryed to see if i could see it again but it was gone .i walked the road from one side to the other it took me about 7 or 8 strides to get to the other side.im 6,1 .the area is very woody scrub oaks and tall pine The only thing that we can figure is that during the day we had taken our family fishing in the grove and we were followed back by what I honestly believe to be a bigfoot it was 8 to 9 foot tall The the hairs on the back of my neck stood up.I turned around and i saw a 8 to 9 foot tall creature it was covered in black.I slowly backed away just watching it and its head turned the other way and it walked off and i have never gone back to that one spot.Please i need you guys to come out as soon as you can. One thing that stood out to me: when the arm swung up, I noticed the palm area was much lighter than the rest of the arm, almost a light grey or even off-white color, which was in stark contrast to the much darker hair that covered the other areas of the arm, torso and back Height: 8-9 feet Weight: 4-600 lbs The ""mom"" was 8 to 10 feet tall with brownish-gray hair MY BEST DESCRIPTION OF WHATEVER IT WAS WOULD BE A HUGE FOOTBALL PLAYER IN FULL SHOULDER PADDING (6-7' TALL) WEARING A FULL LENGTH LONG, SHAGGY FUR COAT We looked at each other and my friend had tears in his eyes I took my shoe off and put my foot in the print, I wear a size 11 1/2 shoe and the print was larger than my foot. At the time my knowledge of Sasquatch, Bigfoot or the skunk-ape was limited only to what I had seen on t.v My brother left the garbage bag hanging 10 feet away from us and we went to bed  Its hair covered most of its body, but it had bare places on its face and elbows Okay, we lived in a mobile home meaning it was on blocks, and no dog, even on their hind legs could peek into the window It was a loud splash like a rock or heavy object was thrown because it hit about 15 feet from shore he was hunched and he was black then we went down there and we didnt see him then we saw footprints and it wasnt just any footprints they were prety big they were about 3 feet and we didnt here anything cuz we had our helmets on and the atvs are pretty loud. It appeared to be brown, about 8-9 ft tall and no face IT  WAS INDEED ABOUT 6-7' TALL BY MY BEST ESTIMATE I was 6 feet 1 inch tall and weighed 120 pounds  I eventually was blessed enough to take over 100 photos of her as I had waited for her to possibly exit just a few hundred feet further down the road  It was  a large creature, approximately 7 1/2, 8 feet tall covered with grayish black hair walking across the highway But it was covered in hair Its hair on its head was long and seemed angled to its shoulders What description I can give is this: ""it"" was tall, 7 ft maybe My first instinct was to think it was a bear, but then as I continued to fixate on the animal, I realized it had very long black hair and was extremely broad in the shoulder/lat area The creature looked at least 6' ft tall THIS THING WAS HUGE IN SIZE AND HAD TO BE ABOUT 8 TO 9 FEET TALL Especially on the arms and shoulders The minister said the creature ""had dark, lighter-than-black hair on its head and chest, not much on its arms, and none on its face As we were walking through the woods we saw what seemed to be a large extremly hairy creature Having never been to Lake Mack prior to the 15th, I had earlier looked at the Google Maps application installed on my Blackberry to get directions Then i got to thinking this figure was standing up and not on all fours and was so tall I thought it couldn't have been a man stealing our food It was standing approximately 50 to 70 feet from us I am a non-denominational christian and I don't necessarily believe in ""bigfoot"" What I saw was a living creature, everything articulated perfectly, head, arms, and legs While driving through the Ocala National Forest in Fl on Highway 19 a couple of years ago, I look from my car window to the right and saw what I believe was a big foot looking back at me  I had B&W film in my camera, left over from the stars shoot, and took a few photos of the footprint It didn't sound metallic; it was very much like wood-on-wood, with a duration of three or four seconds between each whack, which I counted at three  As it turned, it appeared to be holding something in its arms.  The arms seemed to be raised in the air as it made these undulating motions  It was dark for more than an hour while that Gator sat there in the dark There were no ears on the head, but it's eyes shown yellow in the light and the sholders appeared like a football player's The hair kind of stood up above the head  Suddenly, the other than human walked on hands and feet to the middle of the road and then stood erect I disagree, it was lean and too fast to be a bear walking on hind legs I could just make out a shape, it was large, grey or brown covered in hair Only I was staring level in its eyes weight would be around 400 lbs (my best guess).I could not tell what the hind feet looked like due to the amount of hair but I did note that they were longer than that of a bear After a bit my cousin starts frantically trying to open his door which I don’t know if it got locked and he left the keys in the ignition or the door doesn’t open from his side, so I look in the rear view mirror and there standing is this huge dark figure ( here comes the goose bumps again) standing there, in the dim light you can see the fur texture and the muscles, so I turn around and look through the window and I see it just standing there like if it was shocked to see us there and I remember as soon as I opened the door and my cousin  started the car it took off to the right and we hauled butt to the left towards our neighborhood I do remember it was just kind of walking in a small area like it was trying to decide what it was going to do and I remember its arms were long just down by its side and swaying I'm not sure how big Bigfoot tracks usually are but I've never seen anyone with feet that big That arm was attached to something that can only be described as a bigfoot tall and had brown hair This thing had medium to dark reddish/brown hair/fur, when it snarled/growled at me I was fishing off the bank relaxing & waiting for the guys to get back.It had been about an hour since the other person turned in.It was around 11:30 at night when I heard the most piercing scream I have ever heard in my life!.....It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up stand up!!! I have heard panthers scream and bobcats and this was a more high pitched sound!I was turning all the lamps on in camp whem about 30 seconds after the first scream, I heard a second I got maybe thirty yards off the road down the skidder trail and I am not sure what it was but the hair on my neck stood straight He was big, well over six feet, had a massive chest and arms, and was covered in shaggy dark hair It was tall, black, and had thick fur that appeared to be semi-long and coarse Could not see the face well because of all the hair I was raised out in the sticks, as it is called, in the foothills of North Carolina, and I know that your average nocturnal critter, raccoons, opossums, etc don’t just flee at the sound of a quiet human voice As I approached the footprints, I compared them to the stripes in the road I saw its head rise up first, then its back, then it appeared to go to all fours, and finally pushed itself up with its long arms onto two legs I could see the brown body hair as it turned it's whole body all at once, bent its head, and went into the brush/woods Suddenly, we heard crashing sounds, like footsteps only louder   [I]t was standing in the tree line kinda squatting,standing very still,and looking at me,it had reddish,brown hair,long arms.oval head,its face was kinda blurry,iwas approx It then grabbed two nearby small trees and began to shake them and my eyes lit up A large creature jumped up from a squatlike stance like it was startled and raised its arms over its head  There are empty grated lots directly across the street from my house (about 125 feet deep) and then approximately another 25 feet or more of dense palmetto scrub and primarily pines and loblolly bay trees down to the lake shore The time was about 8 pm and it was dark and raining a little As we sit up and was talking he described a tall looming figure which walked up and was looming over the lean to was looming over it Our bear here are jet black and if they stand and you have the rare chance to see that, they aren't very tall The lanes are separated by a wide grass median, maybe 50 feet wide that serves as a drainage feature for the highway They both turned to run back to their parents and the witness said when she turned back the creature was walking away on two legs  One summer night we both woke up with a feeling like something was watching us, and when we looked at the window we both saw a dark figure looking down at us through the window ""I've got some information about Bigfoot,"" the tremulous voice on the telephone said It had long dark brown hair My guess at it's height is somewhere between six and seven feet tall at the top of its head 4.5 feet tall the area where the mouth and nose is was short hair and skin appearance.I could also see that the long hair on the arms did not go all the way to the hand area It was covered with black, shaggy hair we were able to see its eyes which were dark I have not had a sighting of him yet but I do have a picture of a foot print and we have heard howls and knocks There were many different sounds, from growling and snorting to footsteps Suddenly, right out of nowhere, (with only our headlights for illumination), a tall, huge “black form” rushed from the right edge of the roadway and came toward us, (in a perpendicular path as if to cross the highway) I would estimate that the smaller creature was about three feet tall Whatever it was it was able to make a leap from the street and across a canal and land on it's feet We have alot of trees on our property and this thing was as tall as our orange tree (about 8 feet) None of us recall seeing a face or any other clear details considering that all that was really visible was a jagged hairy silhouette against the dimly lit woods We jumped off the dock to get a closer look, it was exactly how a big foot print looks At that instant behind the vehicle  closest to me I saw a tall, dark figure on 2 legs swiftly cross the road from south to north  the mobile home sat about three feet off the ground at that time, so the bedroom window alone had to be at least 8 feet from the ground Realizing it was much taller and moving I pointed it out to the others, turned to see if they looked, when suddenly everyone bolted What I saw was very large, hunched over, and moving quickly toward  the wire fence and was a greyish color and the hair was longer, so it was not a loose cow or large hog At first we thought it was one of the installers working with us, but as it moved closer to the clearing you could clearly see it was not a human  As my eyes follow a 3-pack of the large birds up off the road and cross over the the right, I see a man walk into the woods up ahead I looked down and found a footprint in the sandy trail it looked like a huge foot both wide and long We went to where we saw it and noticed a footprint in the wet ground When I moved (in 1974) to south florida, neighborhood kids would tell me stories of a bigfoot-like creature (they called it a ""skunk-ape"") roaming the fringes of the everglades with the occasional sighting We had just passed a cow pasture about 30 feet prior, so I babbled, ""I a...a...a think it was a cow."" We drove silently for a few miles The smaller creature appeared to be completely limp from the neck down, but its eyes were open and it was moving its head and looking toward the trees to which it was being carried They saw something walking up right covered with gray hair My nephew tried to step out the places it appeared to step but the stride was to wide for him These days we both use each other as our witness that on that April in 1994 we both did truly indeed see a Bigfoot It is probably human but who would be out there barefoot?? We ended up laughing quite hard about it after we named him Eddie the Yeti and I will ad this is not the first time I have heard or smelt something out of the ordinary while in the woods. Had a lot of hair. It started to get dark and I decided that I was going to get out of there a few minutes early I have never been able to say that what I saw was a Sasquatch, Bigfoot or Skunk Ape (the most common term in my area)  We saw exactly the same thing …  a very large bipedal (7’ or more) standing just over the rise (could see it from knees up) with it’s back to us It was getting dark out so we couldn’t see any detail on the face The second thing that struck me as odd was that my uncle's red nose pit was awake but still curled up at the foot of the bunks We estimated it to be between 7 to 7 1/2 feet tall and 2 feet wide There were no prints in the footprint, like what my shoe left behind The creature took 3 or 4 very distinct strides before its lower body became obscured from view by some undergrowth I could tell right where it crossed because there where big wet footprints on the road A large dark brown animal, standing on the side of the road, about 6 and a half feet tall The hair was more like an orangutan These were tall dumpsters Its rear end was pushed up high from the ground, about 4 feet or so, but when it got to the other side of the road it stood up and ran on two legs  We are the only ones who sit on our lanai after dark in this area It intriged us greatly when we looked to the left and saw a foot print that was not a normal size  Both my buddy and I had that whole hair on the back of the neck thing going on big time The hair was brown  in color and approximately three inches in length They both thought it was a very tall, naked dark human being I looked over to my right and saw something large and black about a football field distance away They were both dark brown color from head to toe A tree about 25-30 feet from the dock started rocking violently  The distance between the tracks was approximately 5 feet on average and the depth of the tracks where the heel had sunk down was 3 plus inches It sounded similar to some of the Bigfoot sounds, hoots, we listened to in my Biology class, but they were longer. THE FOOTPRINTS WENT THRU A PUDDLE OF WATWER THAT WAS FROZEN ,OR HAD ICE ON IT  TOTAL TIME I SAW IT WAS AROUND 2 TO 3 SECONDS BUT AS IT WALKED AWAY INTO THE DARK IT SEEMED TO KEEP LOOKING BACK AT ME. One of the other installers ran down to the creek and found that our cooler was gone, as well as the rope and stick it was tied to The officer I was talking to said when he told me to look, the subject had crossed out of my line of site around another building 100 feet to the south of our location  She immediately stopped the car just a few feet away from this thing not wanting to hit it, and just stared in shock at what she and her Son were seeing Someone had cut down some pine trees and nailed two sheets of plywood to them about three feet off the ground I never had the thought “skunk ape” or “Bigfoot”…I truly wanted to find a rational explanation for the creature that crossed the road (in just a couple of steps) and continued, unhurried, towards the line of trees on the other side This morning there were 2 large footprints in the sand pile And it wasn't like it was eyes looking from below The creature continually stood upright on two legs, was approximately 7' tall, had hair covering it's entire body (except for the face) and was rocking back & forth I looked to my left and about 15' into the woods I saw a pair of glowing yellow, human shaped eyes staring back at me It was a dark mound of crouched flesh and soggy hair The sun would only shine in spots through the top of the trees and I could see the hair/fur shine maybe every 5 seconds or so/ This thing made noise/sound only twice from itself, once when it first rose up, I interpreted it as a ""Damn now I have to move"" moan/grunt.. It was about 2:00am and we hit a pair of eyes that appeared to be approx.7 to 8 ft There were 6 tracks in all covering about 30 feet of ground As I was walking home, early one evening, I heard heavy sounding foot steps on dried leaves in the woods along the dirt road It was only 300 feet back to a clearing behind the director's mobile home trailer, and I know I covered the distance faster than any Phys Its arms hung down nearly to its knees Standing in plain sight was a BIG dark figure Whatever it was, it appeared to be large, at least the size of a person, but it was dark, with a wide body structure, and even from the distance at which I saw it (maybe 300-500 yards) it looked as if it was covered in hair His arms were long and appeard to hang nearly to his knees We had one smaller window and beneath that is where we kept our toy chest, and in front of it was a chair It was very hairy and we could definitely make out a head and shoulders When we got to where they lead us there was bigfoot nealing next to the stream drinking  Both startled we put out life jackets on and got ready to leave when we heard the footstep start back up, and they sounded as if they were running away at a brisk pace and it sounded like it was a long stride We had began to cook dinner and were still carrying on conversations about our sighting of a hairy creature two days prior, with the other installers ribbing us saying we must had been drinking on the job and such When I slammed the door, I looked across the passenger seat out through the passenger side window and saw the creature about 15 feet into the woods as it got up and stood up on two legs I was inside sitting in my chair so that I could see him The clearing was about 50 feet in diameter That is when I looked down and seen these huge foot prints that appeared to be barefoot A note of interest; the witness told us the hair on it's head looked ""slicked back"" as if it had just been combed, not as if it were wet As I was driving less than a minute a car heading to me was speeding and flashing there headlight highbeams.I didnt know if it was teens playing around or somebody that had to much to drink,so I blew it off.As I was coming to the curve there is a fence maybe 4 to 5 feet tall  He found, what he believed to be, hair on some brush The person with the spotlight swept the light across the side of the road, and all 3 of us that were in the back of the truck saw this creature standing about 25 feet from us, and back off the road in the trees I followed the trail in both directions for approximately 150 yards and the footprints remained consistent in both directions  I was looking down at my camera adjusting the ISO settings and I saw something large move out of the corner of my eye (to my left) approximately 200 feet away It was very tall, and broad As I was hitting the treeline with the light there was no sight of any movements, eyeshine or anything so I stepped as close to the waters edge as I could Its arms were held close to its sides While deer hunting in Milton Florida I saw a large reddish brown unknown animal run on it's hindlegs through a cleared powerline area, 10 miles north of Whiting Field Naval Airstation I roughly estimate that it was around seven feet tall; its color was not really distinguishable due to the poor lighting If it ain't a bigfoot..  I immediately felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up There was something in the water staring at me very dark colored black looked hairy At the time I did not know much about the bigfoot but my dear friend has since educated me and I am totally convinced , especiallly since reading this article on Lake Co  Its upper legs were thick and powerful looking across the shoulders, covered with dark brown hair with a redish tint standing on two legs Until one night I was home alone with my puppy dog.We were sitting on the pourch, and you couldn't see three feet in front of you The witness believes that the dog walked up on a Bigfoot and was kicked by the creature 8' 6"" to 9' tall.  There are tall, 6-7 foot, plants at the end of my property The creature was about six feet tall, with reddish-brown hair all over it's body  The best description we can give is it is a two to two and a half inch light brown hair, which is wavy with a kink close to the middle of it  we never been bothered other then that night this creature screamed at us and we took it as it did'n't wan't us there i felt we disturbed something, invaded it's territory, i hope this helps for after i started my own research i came to the conclusion that these creatures do exist call it what you want (bigfoot, skunkape, sasquatch) they are real and they don't bother us except when we invade their space   I then saw that there was hair blowing on its legs, long hair As we continued to stare it slowly moved slightly to its left fully exposing itself from behind that small clump of trees, as it moved it raised its left hand up and outwards in order to grab a tree branch while at the same time leaning forward as if to get a better look at us, my brother said that when it did this that from his particular angle he could see long hair dangling from its arm He further described the creature as being approximately 7' in height; 250 to 275 pounds with a muscular, ""squatty"" build and was covered with reddish hair  I looked at the tall grasses surrounding the area and they were not blowing in the same manner I then heard something moving off towards the northwest (I would guess about 100 feet) Id like to add that when I realized what I was looking at that I was 100-150 feet away Regardless I continued to walk, and the footsteps were remaining parallel with mine, and it bacame clear that whatever was two my right was walking on two feet from the stepping pattern One of the guys saw its eyes and said they were huge 20 to 25 feet as i was going around the curve my headlights caught something that looked to be 3 to 4feet taller than the fence  The bedroom window was only about a foot wide and a foot tall and was only about one foot from the ceiling in a few strides After about a minute had passed of no further movement, I saw a tiny dark portion of the creature peek out from behind a pine tree that was growing near the side of the road about 15 or 20 feet in front of me It's eyes are very dark almost empy looking I have a few, where I live in Charlotte county, borders the web reserve, and is woods for miles and miles, when I started to build my home, just after hurricane Charlie, I had an rv trailer on my property to live in while my home was being built, so I could keep an eye on the building supplies, I had a hot tub outside of my trailer and I would take a soak in it every other night or so usually after midnight, many times I would hear what would sound like someone smacking 2 2x4s together some distance away, and sometimes it would come from different directions, I would sit there thinking to myself why in the world is someone working out here in the woods at 1am, but I just blew it off, after the home was built I didn't hear the wood smacking anymore, because I was in my home and not outside late at night, then I had a deck built on the front of my home, my home is a 2 story home and the deck is on the second floor in the front, after the deck was built we started using it at night and would you believe it I started hearing the sticks hitting again every once in a while not every night, still I was thinking to my self why is someone working so late at night, then I was watching a bigfoot show and saw that they bang sticks together to talk to each other and then it all made sense to me, about 5 months ago one of my lids to one of my fish boxes were lifted off and about 20lbs of mullet were taken out of my boat in my yard, I went out to my boat around 3am to get ready to go fishing and during my walkaround of the boat to check the lights and tires I noticed my ice box lid not on, the lid weighs around 40 to 45lbs and has a bungee cord on it, the bungee cord was still attached but the lid was pulled to the side and fish were taken, and I had a weird feeling that something was looking at me so i fixed the lid and jumped into my truck and drove off, also about 3 or 4 months ago I took my son on a cubscout camp out and we had a small group of around 12 to 15 children, usually there are over 1000 people at a camp out but this time it was just our pack on a special camp, I woke around 230am to use the bathroom and then laid down to go to sleep then I heard a yell that lasted for about 10 seconds and it sounded like one of the yells that I have heard returned on one of the shows on tv, I was born and raised in the woods in fla and am a commercial fisherman and know all the sounds that you will hear in the woods and near shore, and in fla we have a bunch, some from normal animals like foxes or bobcat or panthers will make you get chicken skin and your hair stand on end, but the yell I heard that night was like nothing I've ever heard, it didnt scare me but I knew what it was. The face was dark ( again night time ) it seemed ape like The only reason why we just saw the legs is because we were looking down in front of us so we didnt step on one of the resident water moccasins  About an hour into my nap i was awakened by my friend who appeared panicked and was motioning me not to make a sound my head was on the glass of the drivers side of the sports car we were in he was shaking and pointing at the glass where my head was touching the window i didnt lift my head i slowly rotated my head around and looked thru the glass which had a metallic limo tint on it the king you can see out but not in and i saw the head and eye of a ape like creature trying to look into the car i got nervous we had a gun in the car which i had a permit for my friend was slowly trying to get it from under the seat but i stepped on his hand and motioned no dont do that the ape-like creature was touching the car and continued to try to see in for a good five to ten minutes i had put a reflector plate that was a lightweight tin foil in the front window as well it was trying to look in the front window it walked over to the dumpster which was about fifteen feet from where we had parked i noticed a really strange odor kinda like a skunk but worse more rotten smelling my friend was holding his nose and about to loose it the creature was nosing through the garbage reaching in it had very long arms and was over six feet tall covered in a reddish brown blondish fur shaggy looking,but very tranquil acting and because i did not see any breasts i assume it was male i really couldn't tell, it didnt find anything in the dumpster it grabbed a McDonalds bag ripped it apart and threw it continuing to lightly pull through the dumpster trash for a good half hour looking back at the car a few times then it started back towards the car i didnt want to spook it or make it jump on my car or anything it started to walk off past the drivers side front of the car through the pines and by this time it still was not daybreak but getting close and it continued walking in the Northwest direction we sat there and watched it walk into the swamp the only camera we had was in a locked luggage in the trunk of the car and my cell phone did not have a camera neither did my friends , we obviously couldn't sleep so we started up the car and went straight to the other side Flamingo I've always had a casual interest in the bigfoot dilema It didn't seem to notice the guard rail at all, just went over it in stride it seemed At this point I did think Bigfoot and looked down at the dog but she was calm and seemed happy Shining the light into the woods we did not see any signs of an animal, no deer, no bear, no low branches for an owl to be perched on, just a bare spot in the woods where the eyes were coming from The hair of the chest was slightly orange in the bright sunshine (Just my opinion) I have never thought about this being a bigfoot until a year or so ago and then it all sort of began coming together for me I knew right away that this was not a regular animal or man because it was extremely tall, dark and fast, although it did not appear to be running, the strides covered a great distance.We continued towards our destination and arrived at Bulow Plantation Ruins, a state park where we fish 1979 or 1980 I went back in the swamp and woods in naples  off of floridian ave  where i lived  and we came acrossed a metal cage trap  a tall trap where if  you go in and touch the meat the door will slam behind you  Iwonderd about the trap i knew there wasnt no bear in the area  but we were around the caGE  AND THATS WHEN WE HEARD A LOUD KIND OF ROAR WE RAN OUT OF THE SWAMP AND TOLD MY MOM AND SHE WANTED TO GOBACK THERE BUT IWAS TRYING NOT TO  It stood about seven feet tall and had the shape of a man, not a monkey It started running, I looked at it as it gained speed and its hair was flowing in the breeze, there was no standard locomotive process when less then 100 feet from me just at the woods edge I heard a very loud yell/scream I looked up to see how close I was to the Bayhead, when I saw, what at first was just a dark object at the edge of the bayhead It appeared to be wet because the hair was slicked down against the skin I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me so I looked harder at it and It took off running At first, I paid it no attention, then when the walking stopped, I looked at where the sound come from and saw this very tall hairy creature looking at me from about75 yards away  It took up a quarter of the roadway,  3-4 feet across, I would estimate 4-5 foot at the shoulder The bigger one was a dark brown with a hint of red in the sunlight They all had long arms, hardly any neck and man can they run fast She described it as being ""furry"" with red eyes well we were rideing our atv's and we turnd an corner and in the distince we saw a big black thing,  at first we thought it was another atver but as we got closer it started to look like a person cuz it had alot of hair ...he was just standing looking at us then my brother pointed and said ""look!"" then we all saw him turn and run into the bushes I saw a bigfoot while driving between Bronson and Williston on 27 east, in June of 1991 A couple weeks ago we all heard it and it sent my then 10 year old son running into the house, still light out but getting dark It wasn't facing us and due to the height of the bushes and palmettos, a lower half the body wasn't visible to our eyes I was stunned and replied ""Yea, Huge brown legs cross in front of us and he replied "" I thought it was just my eyes""  I then realized that it had hair all over its body It had kind of a flat face, a flat nose, its eyes were sunk in its sockets."" Whatley said he quickly went back to his truck to get an ax because ""me and that creature was going to mix it up,"" but by the time he returned from the truck the creature had disappeared We found two footprints but no other signs of them IT TOOK 5 STEPS TO CLEAR ABOUT 30 FEET IN TO THE WOODS .I HAVE BEEN HUNTING ALL MY LIFE HERE AND THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME They were like human eyes but not quite It was pretty much hairless It was about 70 yards ahead of us, it appeared to be carrying a small bigfoot child in its arms,it appeared to be about 8 feet tall and completely covered in hair. She then turned to me and said, "" Dad, cows don't walk on two legs.. I walked south from the Trailhead near Coral Farms about 7:00 The fence is 4.5’ tall and it was another 3’ higher and just as wide The structure was about 20 feet from the fire and my motorcycle was parked on the center stand another 15 feet to the other side of the fire As i walked away from the camp and into the darkness of the night, I reached my Jeep, as I was opening the door, I had a feeling someone was watching me The hair seemed to be standing above it's head but there wasn't any wind It was standing about 3 feet in the road on the west bound lane The hair was not shaggy, but smooth like a dog  The limb that snapped was only about 5 inches in diameter and 15 or so feet off the ground I was startled by some heavy footsteps outside on the grass and as I turned to the window I saw a huge shadow pass by as I continued hearing the footsteps Figure was taller that 6 foot As I approached closer I could see that he was walking on the knuckles of his front arms, appearance was dark brown shaggy coat, not like smooth sheen coat or  fur that would be on a Florida black bear In the weeks before this happened to me, there were several sightings of bigfoot reported in the newspaper It seemed a little bigger than mine and was covered with short silvery-gray hair Before this I thought that stories about Bigfoot were interesting but I would dismiss them saying that I would believe it when I would see it We mesure the hight of them by what they walked by and the larger one was around 7 1/2-9 foot tall and the smaller was around 6-7 foot tall We were walking along a dirt/road trail along the focka canal system to find a good bass spot, as we were walking I thought I saw large brownish colored legs ahead on the trail My bigfoot sighting accurred on Saturday, October 27th, 2012 about 6:00pm It was last bow season around the middle of sept in Ocala Na.forest, I was in the tree 1/2 hour before daylight, i had an encounter with a black bear 2 or 3 days before in the same area, it came out on the trail on the way to my stand 20 yards away from me, i have a game cam on my bow that takes good video, & i took a video of it crossing in front of me to show my wife that all the bears that i tell her about were real, Now she believes there are bears, But knowing how & what bears look like in the wild & sound like when they are running away or walking to you, this was no bear, around 45 mins after daylight i felt like something was watching me then i heard a loud sound like a big tree had fallen, but it wasn't one, it was something big that been thrown at my direction, maybe 250 feet away then a scream like i have never heard before let out like a pissed off kid that had not gotten his way & it left in front of me crossing back & forth as if it was trying to let some others know to run or get out of the area , scared  the S#&*^%$ out of me as bad as it made out a scream, the scream went till i could not hear it anymore ,at least a 1000 yards away, i was in the Lake Delancy west back area i think it was off 66 not to far from the Ocklawaha river, to this day i will never go back to this area with out a gun even during bow season , till i see what that was i will not trust the Ocala area.Thank god for my Fla gun permit, i am not a little girl, just not stupid, Hope this helps you find something to prove that they are here , but  you don't have to convince me i am 99% sure thats what i heard , I live in Middleburg where a lot of your sightings take place in Florida, i hunt Camp Blanding & Jennings Forest where i lived off live oak lane till i was 17, i have walked all of that area & when i was 12 i was chased by something for a 1/4 mile 1/2 hour before dark, it smelled like nothing i had ever smelled i my life & it had a grunt i will never forget , it gave me the same felling that something was watching me just like in Ocala, but i didn't see what it was that time either, i was in too much of a hurry to get away & home to a safe place, my Grandmother if she was still alive would tell you that i never opened the front screen door, i busted right threw it & grabbed my 22 rifle & sat on the floor waiting for it, lucky for me it had stopped the chase 100's of yards before my home, but i wasn't taking that chance, to this day i still will not go anywhere with out a gun close, I am 6ft 1inch &275 lbs, but i am not a fool The witness states that the female had hairy breasts and that both bigfoot walked without locking their knees. Laying on the ground 8-10 feet from the tree line was a branch from a pine tree We worked till dark and cleaned and packed up our tools Its head was kinda square, its arms would hang down about where I thought its knees would be. A large bipedal, hair covered animal stood up from behind a group of palmetto bushes My arms let go of the legos and they dropped back into the chest Numerous times while being left alone I can remember the eerie sensation like we were being watched and the hair standing up on the back of my neck Hair Color: Black 6/7 ft tall,long reddish brown hair, and was built like a side by side fridge,very square When we went home a guy friend of my cousins was interested in this phenomena so i went back with him and showed him where it occured and the footprint but it had slightly been messed up  At that second, this thing stood straight up on two legs Earlier in the day we saw a strange ""footprint"" in the mud also. The tracks had a stride of approximately six feet, with a depth of two to three inches   The thing looked half human and half ape!  The creature was about 7-8 feet tall as well  I just finished reading one from the Lee County area that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up My Brother in Law was on his way to my house in Liberty County, driving on County Road 270 known as the Torreya state park road just outside of Bristol in Liberty County, when he seen this huge tall black creature walk across the road, he said it took 4 steps and it was gone I stared at those eyes for minute and than ran down the hallway As I stood up and started to go to the wagon I turned and saw two eyes staring from about 20 foot away AS I TURNED ON THE LIGHT IT LOOKED DIECTLY AT ME THEN TURNED TO THE RIGHT AND WALKED BACK INTO THE DARKNESS BEHIND AN OUTBUILDING THAT BLOCKED THE LIGHT There was very little hair around the face It was the bare footprint of what appeared to be a large man, toe prints included Eyes were dark looking had reddish brown hair that had a shine to it in the sun .Looked to be about 7' or taller  IT WAS A BROWNISH BLACK AND LOOKED KIND OF RAGGED.IF I HAD TO GIVE A GOOD HEIGHT ESSTIMATE ABOUT 6 OR 7 FT TALL I walked roughly 1000 feet into the brush and found a pine tree with a good view to set my tree stand up in There approximately 10 feet to the right of them was a large human like figure I without a doubt heard a whooping noise and a loud prolonged Bigfoot yell It was dark brown to black in color, stood approximately 6 1/2ft  We were about 40 – 50 feet apart I had put my stand out the day before and just parked in pitch black dark area The face of the creature was a dark grey color, with very large dark eyes The feet where huge Ed experience that I might have had in High School but it followed me so closley I could hear its breathing and it was coming from above my head and twenty feet or so in back of me The next day after work my dad, daughter and I went back to the location to look for hair, footprints or any other signs of the animal with no results At this time we were convinced that no human had made these tracks because of the lack of other vehicle tracks and the fact that someone walking 3 miles barefoot in this terrain with one bad foot was unlikely  We looked at each other and asked each other jokingly, “Is that Bigfoot?”  It did not sound like any human we had ever heard  As she was driving along all of a sudden a hairy upright creature walked right up out of the swamp on one side of the road and continued walking out in front of her car, and then it just stopped And it wasn’t a man, unless he was covered in hair from head to toe. tall, it appeared to be standing in a clearing about 20 ft There were no sounds made that I could hear at that distance and by the time the hunting crew came back to pick me up it was too dark to investigate further. As we were pulling a string line, abruptly, a dark, bipedal form stepped into our fence line about 60 yards ahead of us  On a branch about seven feet from the ground we found a hair sample The sound was followed by a few footsteps, then silence I cannot give more details of the bigfoot but I can say for myself that I didn't perceive any danger from it  It was about an hour after dark and it was starting to get cold While it was running on the asphalt it looked like a lemur running on all fours, once it hit the grass it stood up and continued running bipedally without skipping a beat and made maybe three steps until it was in the woods One footprint was on the dividing line down the middle I am 5 foot 6 inches  It had a dark face which did not register with me  That's when I started hearing those heavy foot steps on the dried leaves, again  He was probably about twenty yards or less away from our little campsite, walking throught the tall (2-3 ft.) grass I felt the hair on my neck stand up and about that time, I heard the same low growling noise straight in front of me that we had heard in July It was standing there on two legs with a human-like shape It looked as though it had a pointed head and we thought it stood about 7-8 feet hi my name is eric and i felt i needed to write this.me and 3 friends were camping in richlom wild life management area on labor day weekend we were just sitting around the fire when all of the sudden i noticed it got very quiet and all the bugs disappered then we haerd what sounded like a tree being up rooted so we grabbed the spotlight and started searching what it was we found a good sized pine tree half pushed over then we sat back down and as soon as we did we haerd a very very odd growl then we stood back up and started panning the spotlight when we saw a very hairy 11ft object we stood motionless as we looked at it then it darted off and then thats when i left camp site and went home my number is *** *** **** if you have any questions thank you. It looked so much like Bigfoots, that I figured it must be a hoax. I told him no, look at where I'm looking and tell me my eyes aren't playing tricks on me we had a pretty good dry season one year an we went back to the pond to see how bad the water had gone down and noticed very large tracks of some sort, as we were approaching the pond first thought was one of the cows had walked through but as we got closer they were human foot tracks but abnormally very large tracks It had no white to its eyes.The eyes where all brown with black pupils 3-400 feet away It was so fresh that you could still see the thermal lines in the mud from the bottom of the foot I was on my way back from a delivery in okeechobee on I 95 near mile marker 158 in when i noticed people hitting their brakes and pointing out to the right,upon looking i saw an 8 foot tall hairy creature whose arms were past its waist in lenghth,standing upright but shoulders were hunched over,it was taking small strides in between the cypress trees behind the fence on the side of the road,about fifteen feet into the trees.I couldnt see it face,but its whole body was black hair,it wasnt thin by any means.I didnt see any features that would have made me feel that it was female..It was about 3:15 P.M on Friday the 21st of January 2012. About 1 minute after disappearing into the tree line, the creature reemerged, this time walking completely upright on two legs, just like a human My foot got caught on a root of a tree and I fell Both me and my wife were very shakened and I looked at her and just said ""Did we just see a Bigfoot?!"" She answered back ""I think so, I really think so!"" For the rest on the drive we were a little freaked out, and when we got home, put the kids in their beds, we sat up the rest of the night going over and over again on just what we had just witnessed. The figure that I saw was taller than the vehicle ahead of it and it appeared to cross the road in 3 or 4 stiff-legged strides My mom and my brother and sister were together near the road, but I wanted some space, so I was about ten to fifteen feet away closer to the end of the space The creature looked like a male around I am guessing 6 to 7 feet tall with a thick body, thick legs, wide shoulders  As I laid on top of my sleeping bag and ready to get some sleep, a tree had fallen 20 feet or so in front of my tent with an extremely huge thud, or so I thought it was a tree It was wide across the shoulders with hair and looked like moss hanging from it BUT IT WAS DARK SO IT WAS HARD TO TELL  Brock looked around for the creature and for signs of any footprints I would guess that it was about 6-7' tall It then put its arms forward, moving out of the crouched position, and then quickly crossed the road in front of me using both its arms and legs to walk on all fours, just like a four-legged animal It was very large (at least 6 feet tall or more) completely black in color with a VERY wide chest from front to back As I got closer I saw that it was not a man but a creature that looked like a man but with (approximately) three inch long brown hair covering it's body from head to foot As we got up the trail by where I saw movement one of my sons noticed some foot prints, that were larger than normal and right next to some deer tracks What ever it was, was about 2 maybe 3 foot tall judging by the trees and was very black and resembled a primate However, my feet took me into the house and up the stairwell  The hair was not thick and bushy  It was a dark tan in color but had a little black around it's shoulders It appeared to be crouching down because the peek appeared about 3 or maybe 4 feet up the side of the pine tree from the base of the tree on the ground It walked through the scrub for what I would estimate to be about 15 or 20 feet, and then stopped, again completely obscured from my view They were too far off, and besides, I never knew a Bigfoot type creature existed in central Florida, at that time The ground was to hard to leave foot prints and it was covered in pinestraw and leaves So we walked the boardwalk and I looked out to the cypress heads and squatting down at the base of a cypress tree was a dark figure It looked like tall thick brush or woods It was a bigfoot and it was huge! I had to hit the brakes, it was so close to the car I know that I heard and saw bigfoot's shadow So we just laughed about it most of the day and joked about Bigfoot but never did we actually think that was what may have been outside of our tent and eating our food, We had to go in to town for more groceries that day Distance from the animal was 50-60ft away.I could tell that he had more of a round shaped eyes, from this distance they appeared to be dark in color with a lighter color of hair around eyes (short and greyish brown, older in  appearance) same hair color would be around the side of face and what would be the area where the ears would be Its chest was 2 feet above the seat as it was bent over the bike The woods are thick there so, someone or something would only have to stand a few feet away to disappear It was tall and had reddish brown hair, tending toward brown I've always been a skeptic of bigfoot but now I'm definately a believer The creature was approximately 7' tall, bulky, reddish dark brown in color and continuously walked upright I went into the room, sat on my legs in the chair and opened the toy chest There’s no way I could hear an owl call that far away and the last two were dead on/textbook Bigfoot calls The developers had a drive made by dumping a pad of coarse gravel, about 2.5 to 3 feet high, about 300 yeards back into the swamp  Have you ever heard of a bigfoot doing this to make himself less visible in the woods?  Under the poor lighting conditions I could not tell what color it was, it looked gray in the shadowy lighting, and it looked furry or hairy Once we got out of the stand we went to go investgate what had happened, and that is when we saw the footprints left in the sand When this thing screemed in our window, to reach the window from outside it would have to be at least 7ft tall When we left the trail head there were not any other vehicles parked and vehicles are not permitted off the grades.It was 30 minutes till day break and still very dark when got to my spot The fires had been raging for weeks and people in the area were reporting missing pets, some of which were inside 6 foot privacy fences (UPI) - A 67-year-old Baptist minister who says he hasn't had a drink in 40 years tells how he stood eyeball-to-eyeball for 30 seconds with a great, hairy creature in the Ocala National Forest Still there was a gully between the guard rail and the tree line, maybe 20 feet deep tall   It ran like a man, upright, It was 11pm, so naturally the color was dark in appearance The first, that after reading one of your articles, I now feel very strongly that I was being followed by a ""Bigfoot.""  I lived on about 100 acres that butted up to Cecil Webb (a Game Reserve of apprx The trees were very tall and even the palmettos were very thick and tall so I`m not sure how tall  When it leaped it didn't swing it's arms out or bend it's knees to jump it just leaped flat footed, pushing off I had noticed myself that the steps sounded bipedal As I was looking around I noticed a tall dark brown hairy figure just standing there looking at me I can’t wait! My Bigfoot radar will be at peak level! I saw a ""hairy man"" crawl from the water, stand up and walk across the road One of these was on a rock and another was found on the trail while following the footprints It appeared to be mostly covered with orange/brown hair, un-human long arms and an odd shaped head (wide, pointy and large) with a very short neck  I don’t know if this is even possible to be bothered by a Bigfoot in The Villages She said she saw something ahead of her about 300 feet big and hairy standing near the road and the closer she got it moved away from the highway into the woods  Neither of us would admit we were afraid so we stayed all night (but didn't sleep much)  The next day I looked for footprints or disturbed soil or grass and found nothing. The creature had very large eyes. There is without a doubt a Bigfoot in Chito Nature Preserve It’s extremely foggy out tonight The footprints here were identical to what we saw at the first trail The animal had long hair all over its body I reached a distance of about 6 feet from the object when it stood up As I turned to run I seen a tall figure through the pepper trees, I didn't stop to see what it was but it was huge and wasn't on all fours as I reached the fence It walked up to within a few feet of the hut, then turned and walked away Roland observed a brownish colored bipedal creature about 300' west of the  road, at the edge of the brush A 22-year-old hitchhiker reported sighting the legendary Bigfoot, saying the beast was tall, dark and stinky Whatever it was didn't take notice of us right away, but as we got closer it looked up and raised its ""arms"" above its head as if it was waving at us  On the edge of our yard, just 6 or 8 feet from the tree line, was a large, crouched figure Newspaper Article : Chronicle (Houston, Texas), July 2, 1980 ""POLICE THINK MYSTERY FOOTPRINTS ARE FAKES"" ALTOONA, Fla My family found a track of footprints on our hunting property It was a footprint, similar to a humans across and though it was in a slumped standing position it had to be 8 feet tall with long muscular arms and long chest and mid section like its legs were shorter than chest area It couldnt have been about 40 or 50 feet away This creature was dark and hairy and was walking on two feet It was dark, but there was enough light to see what I saw It walked slowly with its arms hanging low and a hunched over back The color of the hair seemed to be dark On a previous Previous trip out to my mother-inlaws land I in stalled a tempory gate in the barbed wire fence I’m not saying, for certain, that what I heard, that night, were Bigfoot calls, but now, I have a good explanation for what has mystified me for years  It seemed as though it never missed a stride I judge it to be 3 1/2 to 4 feet tall and between 75 and a 100 pounds One evening after dark, me and a buddy was watching the movie from the projects side of the river, you could not hear the sound from the movie but at least it kept me off the streets I could actually see the outline of the ribs through the skin and hair that covered it  I would imagine a bigfoot encounter to be much more exciting than this But I convinced myself that it was a bear, for whatever it was had enormous lung capacity, but it always bothered me that it was obviously walking on two feet, and it left without making a sound.  I looked for tracks or hair left on the plants in the area but found nothing (The researcher, in this case, has examined and photographed the plaster casts.) A couple (names confidential) was out watching birds and wildlife when it began to get dark The 1st was tall and quite big, well over 6 feet The patrol officer I was talking to sped off in his vehicle in the direction of the trees and I followed on foot Never tried to harm us or make any contact but the thought of it still raises the hair on my neck The creature ran with a long, fast, heavy stride as it crashed through the palmettos until it could be heard no more  Brock further explained that this creature was definitely not a bear, that it's legs were too long to be a bear and that it walked upright the entire time of her observation It was pitch black and very quiet, except for the footsteps This thing had to be 7 or 8 feet tall and huge  I waited for a few minutes while I listened intently and then I heard the palmetto fronds swoosh open as something exited them and stood just 15 foot or so on my right side of the tent It was between 7 and 8 feet tall I was kinda frightened camping and being alone in the dark so he told me that to comfort me I saw no hair, there was no smell- just a bed of palmetto fronds laid out nicely in the middle of the clump I think i saw either Skunk Ape or Bigfoot It ran on two legs to the north across the highway IT WAS DIRECTLY STRAIGHT ACCROSS FROM THE PORCH ABOUT 40 TO 50 FEET OUT IN A SMALL AREA OF PINE TREES I remember this distinctly because I was IDing foot prints of animals and insects  I didn't even believe in bigfoot before this  It looked around for a moment and jumped down; what must have been 20 feet. There was rain and we came up on what we thought was a person along side of the the road but as we got closer, what we saw was something that was around 7 feet to 7 1/2 feet tall.Long dirty shaggy yellow looking hair As we were watching the tree we heard something heavy footed walking around the pepper trees off to the side of us, my friend freaked out and took off running out of the tree line toward the houses As it crossed the road the arms swung slightly, especially when going over the guard rail It was crouched down slightly and then stood up as we got close.It was about 8 feet tall Not really any hair on his face IT'S EYES WERE LIKE CICLE ORANGE RINGS At that time I saw arms that moved but really saw the separate legs and saw what was matted hair stuck together from the leg He definitely had an ape-like face and hairy body I noticed its face was very flat, with no snout or jawline, but with hair all around it There were a few scruffed places but the distance between them looked too far apart to be foot steps  I also had noticed the noises of the footfalls were widely spaced apart,...parallel but yet on an intersecting tract The farmer said that  the bigfoot comes into his garden and take his crops As the animal approached the edge of pavement, he then stood up on it's hind legs with a slight curvature and legs bent, he then crossed the road on its hind legs arms swaying or swinging (longer appearance of arms as that of a primate)as I approach closer to the animal and start to slow my vehicle down, this animal turned its head and glanced partially, (matter of factly)  The hair was long, reddish-brown So, at this point, I was looking at its torso through about a 3 to 4 foot clearing between the scrub below and the branches above One nite a deputy stopped and said they had a Bigfoot sighting in the Ocala National forest, and being the curious type, I asked where and he told me I do know that whatever is may have been convinced two grown men, both of them, to immediately go out and purchase handguns to carry during each and every future outing! Not sure where the sound clips of the growls come from on the ""finding Bigfoot"" television series.. My daughter immediately assumed that it was a bigfoot track The old man and his wife would tell me stories about this Bigfoot IT TOOK THE DIRT ROAD IN 3 OR 4 STRIDES! and looked our way not stoping while it walked we were kind of far away we were on one side of a gully it was on the other It's frame was very large from the hips up and it was covered with shaggy silvery-gray hair When we returned home we told our children but then we said our eyes must have been playing tricks on us as it couldn`t have been what we thought we saw it must have been a tree along the road We were out driving looking for a bigfoot sighting, and after driving for over an hour we had one #1) and observed 2 Bigfoot crossing the road from west to east I remember it was around 2am to 4am and we were driving home and before our entrance to our neighborhood there is a small lake with a patch of forest in the middle of it, and across from it there is the neighborhood playground and a daycare which was pretty dark at that time so my cousin decides to pull in by the playground to smoke a cigarette We rushed around to pack our 4 man tent, lawn chairs, coolers and get groceries for the weekend and a case of oysters Me and my buddy were out in the woods hunting in Pierson Florida on ninemile rd we were driving out and I noticed something big and brown in the ditch on the side of the road crouching down then it stood up and walked back and fourth across the road then crouching back down we know for a fact it wasn't human it was about nine feet tall. Every hair on my body stood up right, I had instant goosebumps from my head to toe, and every instinct told me to flee The hair seemed to be short  We both turned around and saw a dark figure moving the palmetto bushes aside with it's hand to look at us, then duck back down behind the bushes Driving through  Florida and saw two large eyes about 6 feet off the ground Over an 11 year period I found footprints And the height, maybe 8 feet The hair was flowing like it would if it was blowing in the wind  My best estimate would make it 6' 5"" or taller  There was a small sapling (8 - 10 ft tall) next to the large tree, with surrounding grasses about 2-3 ft tall  A somewhat fluid stride for its massive size All four of us were at camp which was set up on the bank of Blackwater Creek, about 15 feet from the waters edge While bowhunting from a tree stand in a row of trees looking out over a field, I saw a very large animal walking on it's hind legs come out of the woods towards me, turn to its left, walk in front of a large oak tree, then turn to its left again and reenter the woods this was in 07 and i havn't thought much about it until last night i was watching Finding Bigfoot and BoBo made a call and the hair stood up again, it wasn't exactly like it but pretty close By now it’s dark The hair appeared to be long and shaggy or so (to stretch our legs) and I dropped a line in the canal Anyway I was outside fishing and I had caught a couple of snappers and had them there next to me in a bucket, I was dozing off when I heard a noise behind me about 30 feet away in a small canal directly behind me, I was lying down in a lawn cot and not in view of the Skunk Ape With no bears in the area (especially ones that are bipedal), there was only one explanation for what was out there with us that night. As I saw it take those couple of steps I could see the arms swing with the motion of the legs  We would typically wait until it was fully dark before we would go out  This thing, whatever it was, was huge!  I'm no genius but I'd say it stood as tall as 6'5"" possibly 7' THE TOES ON THIS FOOTPRINT WERE EXTRA LONG FOR A HUMAN AND IT HAD NO SHOES ON IT Hard to tell the exact color because it was dark except for the light outside on the house, but it did appear to be a darkish brown color, I am guessing over six foot tall because he stood over the Palm tree about a head length Prior to this experience, I was not a Bigfoot believer I could feel the eyes staring into mine, and I watched them blink, slow and deliberate, just like a human Here is what we saw: It was about 8-9 feet tall, and covered with long dark fur  My friend and I were shocked, we thought it might be a bigfoot but decided to go hunting The footprints measured  approximately 13.5"" in length, approximately 6"" in width at the toes and approximately 3"" in width at the heel I couldn't see any specific colors because of the light but I'd say it was dark brown ""It was standing upright, in the middle of some palmetto bushes, and that sapsucker was at least 7 1/2, maybe 8 feet tall She said she had heard these large sounds, almost like foot steps, except she said that they covered far too much ground Description of it: About 8-9' tall, Reddish brown colored hair, hairy all over, arms that literally hung to the knees and it stood slightly crouched Less than twenty feet away I remembered thinking to myself  Before reaching the area of houses, I spotted what looked like a young pre-teen holding a tall stick vertically this ""Thing"" stood at least 7 1/2 feet tall and ran upwards on two feet Off to the right side of the road I saw what appeared to be a hairy animal standing about 6 ft But it is one that plays itself repeatedly in my mind, And when I hear people scoff at the notion of a giant, hairy, bipedal animal roaming the rural parts of the country, I keep quiet and I feel a little sorry for them As I walked or tried to walk in its stride, it was a stretch for me as I'm a pretty big man myself, 6ft.3in It stood fully erect, the light shine of the eyes were almost gold, it reacted to the light hitting its eyes like a person would, by throwing it's forearm up in front of its face, let out a chilling sound (not a grunt, more like a short howl) unlike anything any of us had heard, it then turned and fled, vanishing like before He was huge, about 12 feet tall and had silver-gray hair The figure in front of me was much broader than I with very long and heavy arms I appeared to be human shaped, bipedal Also near by I found skelatal remains and hair from a bear that seemed to literally have been ripped in half tall with light brown hair cross the road first  It was slim, not heavily muscled, and was covered by grayish-brown hair or fur When we looked we saw a large upright walking (like a human) black big foot type of creature He was hairy all over with tangled reddish brown hair We never went back to look for any signs but I have been back to the area since then and I believe that there is enough room to support at least a breeding pair of bigfoot/skunkape whatever it may be! I know that what i saw was not a bear and way to tall to be a man or even a tall man.  She said she had gone outside just after dark to go to the nieghbors house at the time and there he was standing across the neighbor's driveway across the street  We have never heard anything like this before...until...we watched a special on bigfoot and the gentleman from florida stated he had audio The direction the sound came from, was also the direction I had seen the eyes in the woods previously I was driving on Markham Park Woods road at 5 am and saw a bigfoot on the side of the road. it stood up on just two legs and continued to scamper until it crossed the road and then disappeared into the woods The ground was white sand and there were no human foot prints anywhere It lurked in the darkness in a lightly forested area off U.S to 8 ft.tall, about 4 ft  Brock described the creature as about 7' tall, covered with a furry coat of thick dark brown hair and what appeared to be a patch of off-white or light colored hair on it's chest Informal speculation centered on whether the creature was the infamous ""skunk ape"" - Florida's own version of Bigfoot and the abominable snowman - reportedly last sighted in the Everglades. Looked more like a Bigfoot to me."" I stuck with my ridiculous ""cow story"" until she was much older Roland described the creature as being  approximately 7' tall, long brown hair, standing upright when walking or  running, having a smooth face and resembling a gorilla He guessed at least 7 feet tall I WOULD SAY THAT OUR CAR WAS ONLY ABOUT 10-15 FEET AWAY FROM THIS THING we then went to where it was standing and about 9 feet up was a broken branch from that pine tree A man on the show said a three foot tall hominid ran in front of his car in NC I had just rounded a curve and began on a straight-away north to northwest toward the entrance to Little Talbot Island State Park, which is on the right side of the road, when, in the distance about 150-200 yds ahead on me, I caught glimpse of a bipedal figure standing on the West side of the road just off the right-of-way, not moving It had a cone shaped head, Very longs arms  But from my taillights, I'd still say it was dark in color THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER TIME WHEN THEY WERE SEEN AND IT WAS IN THE CITY OF WILLISTON  I WAS WORKING FOR THE CITY AND WENT FOR A CALL AND IT WAS  IN THE DUMPSTER AT THE TOP OF THE HILL, THIS ONE WAS A YOUNG ONE, HE WAS ABOUT 5 FOOT TALL, WHEN THE TRUCK LIGHTS HIT HIM IT RAN I saw what i thought was a black shadow standing 8ft tall in the woods in front of me It is dense woods with no campsites, or foot access It was very tall, had long arms about to its knees Well today I was at my daughters babyshower and the cousin was there for some reason my 12 year old decided that it was a good time to blurt out I saw a Bigfoot, correcting him I said I heard a noise, and of course he said that I heard a Bigfoot I again corrected him and said that I didn't know what it was and elaberated that it was out on the property It was completely covered in thick hair, all the way to the pavement It was the first thing I thought of as it was on two legs and all the other animals were on four I ONLY SAW IT FOR ABOUT I MINUTE AND IT LOOK TO BE  ABOUT 72 PLUS INCHES TALL, WITH A HAIRY BODY AND WALKED UPRIGHT I heard something big running towards me and it sat down 20 to 30 feet in front of me on the only blind spot I had Its arms appeared to b reached out as if to hit the car  I thought maybe an owl..but they have yellow eyes, and there were no trees close enough for a bird or animal to perch on and be that close to the window I did not believe in Bigfoot and teased my husband because he believed When the couple were asked about further details, of the creature, they advised that they never saw the face and were unable to advise as to body hair It was running into the woods on two legs, and moving very fast It stood about 7 1/2 feet tall and must have weighed about 350-400 pounds It was pitch dark out, with no moon, and there was twisted jungle and you can imagine that kind of plant growth if you've been to the Glades Since the Finding Bigfoot program came on air and as more information comes out I hope to get past the jokers In fact, I was under the belief that the Patterson tape had been debunked and bigfoot was probably a myth I thought nothing of the SUV until this tall creature stepped onto the road and in two steps had crossed the lane I was driving in and was into the left lane and my view of it was then obstructed We have always been interested in Bigfoot, so I knew that it stinks but didnt think it was in central florida I must confess, I'd be thrilled to think I might have seen a bigfoot, but I just don't know because my first thought was that this is just some poor idiot who was going to pass out from the heat in the wilderness (UPI) - Most investigators figure its a hoax, but there is enough doubt in their minds to order casts made of the size 18 footlike prints found in a remote area of the Ocala National Forest The creature turned and had totally disappeared within just a few steps away from us It was very muscular, covered in dark brown fur with a patch of white in the chin area  The sound came from a tree line about 200 feet away at the edge of Horseshoe Lake  The creature had hair all over its body except for around the eyes, nose, and mouth of its face Dee Kirby, called out to make casts of the half dozen 17-inch-by-6 1/2-inch footprints found near a bulldozer in the vicinity of Camp Ocala, a federal job training site The hair hung lightly over the sides of the edges of it's foot It was very wet with the hair laying slicked to the skin, much like what you might see with a wet, long-haired dog The creature was running in their direction but at a long even stride  Just as we got away from the tree line something landed in the water about 50 or so feet from the boat  So after the creature rose out of the crouching position we all ran up the hill to the house to get a camera and a .270 we returned to the scene several hours later to find the pork chops gone the fish gone the poles scatterd around on the ground and we had all had our shirts off since it had been hot and they were laid about 11 feet up on a live oak branch with no sign of the creature left Its face seemed human with a flat nose, its eyes were small and dark The smaller one was not as dark as the bigger and had more of a redish color to it The officer told me that he observed heavly built individual who's estimated height was between 7-8 feet in height It was hair! Matted down, wet hair  However, I was at a very safe distance and in a moving auto, so I might feel differently if I met him on foot Further back from this was the scarce remnants of a burned down house, we rarely explored back further than this due to the increasing darkness, heavy foliage and swampy ness I was walking near the swamp 3 days ago and found a footprint that measured 16in long  The hair is still yet to be identified  This thing walked on two feet and was taller than a man  I was on my regular path through the woods when I saw a lone, large, dark figure  I think I saw a Bigfoot I call it a bigfoot because I am certain of what it WASN'T As the couple looked closer, they realized that it was a very dark complexioned man-like creature that they described as being well over 7' tall, 300 to 400 pounds and looking like a linebacker for a football team... It appeared to be trotting, and its shoulders twisted back and forth as it ran, but its arms hung straight down at its sides, not pumping back and forth like a human's would From what I could see, the top of the hand and arm was very hairy We never mentioned that from the first experience, but we heard it and it did sound as thought it was two footed Also, If there is a credible source to send the hair, to find out its origin, please send us a lab We had just gotten a fire going and it was quite dark by now The face which was covered with short hair I remember thinking it odd how someone could navigate the woods in total darkness without a flashlight (which is why I figured it was someone drunk out to relieve himself) It looked like the common version of the bigfoot stereo-type I see today but back then it just looked like the common ordinary ""boogyman "" to us Me and my friend have been fishing in the glades for over 25 years and have much experience  with wildlife , bors gators, deers black bear, i've even seen panthers and have done a some tracking, i have found footprints that just don't add up; bare human shaped prints in the middle of a cypress swamp, i've seen what looked like a urangutan in the swamp looking at us from behind trees and disappearing and me my friend would always ( this type of sighting twice), jokingly state that someone's pet had gotten away I tried to imitate the step and stride and could not I would estimate that the creature was about 8 feet tall   The fur was longer than that of a deer, yet not quite as long or as deep or dark as a bear i am 6'6' and it was taller than i am.the color was a shi--- brenal brown I stayed motionless while watching this thing, which clearly was NO tree stump start to walk deeper into the woods, heavy steps each time it walked, it was between 7' or 8 feet tall, had hair/fur covering it It also had a really strong musk we could even smell it after it was gone the bigfoot walked acorss the road and put its hand on a bob wire fence pole and broke off the top of the pole and walked over the fence and disappeared, we went back the following day and saw the fence post broke the bob wire fence bent like it may have been stepped on and and all the brush was broken down going into the woodline we didnt go any further thenthat.  Because of the number of alligators there, I at first thought an animal was getting bitten and dragged into the water as we heard water splashing and the yell continued and went from sounding hurt and suprised to angry and mad  (I had heard for a long time that there was a big foot in that area, but have never heard, smelled, or seen anything...well into our 40's we never thought we would.)  The yell lasted approx 5 seconds, going from something sounding like it was hurt fighting and then angry As it grew darker I changed my direction and then began hearing a screech/growl that I was unfamilar with  It did not appear to be as big as I would have imagined, but was probably about 5 to 6 ft tall I was close enough to see the size and it was big, I cannot tell you how tall it was only a guess The sound appeared to come from about 15 feet in the woods behind me I became aware of something way off to my right of the path I was walking to my cabin I heard scattered footfall noises I have never experienced anything like it, the way it made the hair on my neck stand up  It was covered with very dark hair, no neck … what I would call bullet shaped and was from 125 to 150 yards away i had a sighting of what i belive to be a bigfoot We do believe the area is habitat to big foot One guy said ""Its big whatever it is"" And another turned to me and said ""it sounds as though it's walking on two feet"" We were setting up the tents and I looked out into the open field that was about 100 yards away and saw a very tall, I'm not sure what to call it, thing running across the field  Its shoulders and head were visible for perhaps another two or three strides and then nothing could be seen because of pine branches and the fact that the creature moved beyond the area illuminated by the flood lights on the house And it was a bit skinny, with hair all over it's body. The lower part of the animal was blocked by bushes, but they saw all they wanted to see and said it stood about 7 to 8 feet tall The hair was later lost The rear legs definitely seemed shorter than the front I could see his eyes moving around but he was not going to move a muscle  Judging by the height of the grass, we guessed it was about 8 feet tall and by the size of the torso it weighed probably around 400 pounds  He had big dark round eyes, lots of hair and just stared at me till I took off  Looked just like a large ape man, covered in hair I was out hunting small game in Camp Blanding,on the still hunt side,close to Cemetary Road,I had a friend of mine about 150 yards to my right and about 30-40 yards in front.I saw something running between us,going from my right to in front of me,it was between the two of us.It stopped about 50-60 yards in front of me and turned and looked at me,I stood looking trying to figure out what I was seeing for maybe 30 seconds,I then got down on one knee,and watched about 45 seconds,it turned to its right,my left,and was gone.It was a dark brown,allmost black,running kinda like an old man that had back problems,bent over a little at the waist.It was on two legs,not four as all other animals in the woods have.I could see the arms moving as it ran,just as a man's would when he is running.I am 6 foot tall,I walked to the spot I saw it,loooking  at the tree it was beside,and was looking to see if I could tell how tall it was.From what I could tell from what I saw,it stood about 7 foot tall.I looked for any tracks,found none as it was a swamp,nothing but water,but you could see evidence that something was there from the way the grass in the water was laid over.I called to my friend,asked if he saw anything,he said no.We both started walking,hunting more,all the while I was thinking about what I saw.We walked approx The prints were about 4 to 5 feet apart when it walked, and about 1 to 2 inches deep I didn't mention it earlier because I never really thought twice about it, but my fiance and i were watching TV and it was a bigfoot documentary, i asked him if he remembered the event, and he said no, but then told me to go ahead and report it to the BFRO. I didn't stop to investigate due to the face that it was night time and I did not want to have a face to face with what ever I saw alone on a dark road The light revealed a body glistening with long hair  The animal had to be 7-8 feet tall As it got nearer I heard several heavy, bipedal footsteps, almost stomping, coming very close to the wood line bordering the road It was dark brown in color and covered in hair If I had to guess, it was probably close to 7 or 8 feet tall The Bigfoot crossed from an oak hammack into an area of pines and tall palmettos  Although still dark, there were clear skies at the time, and I could see the silhouette of the tree line Raised the hairs on my neck and I got out of there I rode my bike back to my camper as fast as I could and elaborately told my mother and my sister that I just saw Bigfoot Just before disappearing, the small creature wrapped its legs around the back and stomach and clung to the creature’s chest with its arms It looked at me with these red eyes.i felt numb,and frighten.I always think about the other person that was driving that night,what did they see.The sight has been devloped since then, trees almost gone  It also stood only about 5.5 to 6 feet tall at most From what i saw of the creature it was very tall, I'd say around 7-9 feet What we saw was most definitely not a bear, because this creature walked on two legs for the whole sighting, besides we have seen many bears out there, and we know what they look like. we got to the other side & ther it was the biggest foot track I have ever seen  It took me two days to realize I just saw a bigfoot I would also like to note that it was running on two feet, not four  I could hear large footsteps and something that sounded like it was scooping water or slapping water, I really can't describe the sound The foot prints were proably 16"" long and far too wide to be human It had both arms of the smaller creature grasped in its right hand, and was dangling the juvenile along by its side, with the legs of the smaller creature almost touching the ground When I was approximately 80 to 100 yards away, it stood up on two feet There was time for a Bigfoot to hoof it on out there and check out the scene, hey, he even had enough time to pack a bag lunch Had long brown hair all over it I have watched shows where people talk of Bigfoot sightings, and I always question them The creature just walked right out in front of my car, never stopping, walking with purpose, swinging both arms, and I really don't recall the creature ever turning its head to look toward me It was extremely bulky across the bust, with very muscular arms, and I have no doubt that it could have easily busted out the windows and ripped me to shreds if it so desired I had sat there and stared at it even closing my eyes and then looking  again or averting my eyes and then looking it kept staring The creature was 5-6 feet tall weighing about 200-300 pounds  It was really tall, I'd say about 6ft or so  I explained while others were watching the hogs run to the left of the bus I was looking at the flooded pasture to the right and had seen a large bipedal standing slightly over the rise First, I’ll start with the fact that I have never put much stock into the Bigfoot phenomenon  Once in the road I could see the hair moving in the wind as it chased after us, I could see the front legs moving but the shoulders never broke a visual horizontal plane Two or three weeks later I decide to go fishing at the gulf and was driving past the area I hunted at when out of the wood line a big hairy, black bigfoot ran in front of me with my bright lights on  When we heard the audio, we both jumped to our feet in shock, as it was the same type of yell we had heard up river...It is a sound you would never forget. 40 feet to my right a creature came right out of the brush and walked right over to my bike I remembered seeing it's foot later Me and my friend Kaiti were walking Flat Island Preserve in Leesburg Florida Lake County it was about 9:30 at night we were walking the nature trail when we heard a something hit a tree over and over we aproached the area where it was coming from and seen what i think was bigfoot it looked at us for a second and ran off it was about 8 feet. My sister says it was a Bigfoot! My Mom tells the story that it was a ""big ole hairy hippie!"" More like a man than an ape Another strange thing was that he seemed to be dressed in all brown from the head down to his knees (the tall grass covered his lower legs, so I can't say if this guy was wearing shoes or socks) I didn’t look outside the tent, and since I was unaware of the possibility of a Bigfoot creature in the area, it didn't occur to me to check for prints  It made our hair stand strait up  I glanced to where the sound was coming from and saw a tall dark animal running toward my car When I stomped my foot into the mud I still could not reach the depth of the suspicious tracks The creature was covered in a slightly reddish brown fur and I would estimate it was 8 feet tall Approx. A large, hairy, ape-like humanoid standing in the middle of a dirt road at approximately 3:30am It never stood on its hind legs  He said, ""Steph, you know I dont scare eaily, but that scared me so bad it made my hair stand up on ends.""  Well we looked around and didnt see anything but we didnt go behind the shed because it is wooded against it The Hair stood up on my the back of my neck and I was instantedly on alert I almost could not come to terms with what my eyes were seeing The witness feels she was either very pregnant or carrying a young Bigfoot One night in early April of 1994, my two daughters and I were driving in our car, headed west, on SR 16 near Penny Farms in Green Cove Springs, Florida  It took about three strides before it went from on side of the light to the other, the strides were long and smooth, not at all jerky, and it looked like the knees remained bent as if it was not standing straight upright but slouching somewhat, and the arms swung low It was about 8' tall, and was running straight across from me about 50' away I could see them dart back and forth, very similar to how a terrified or trapped animals eyes look It looked tall, according to her about 6 feet  The footprints on the trail had left deep impressions where the heel contacted the ground and footprints much larger than my foot were also seen 1/2 mile from where I saw whatever it was,and he saw a VERY large pile of feces on the ground,we both looked at it for a while,poking at it with sticks,trying to figure out what kind of animal it could have come from.We both have hunted for over 35 years each,and have never seen anything like this.We saw alot of grassy materials,and alot of berries in it.No hair,bones,or anything that you  would see from most carnivores in the woods. IT HAD THE HAIR ON MY BODY STANDING STRAIGHT UP! IT WASN'T UNTIL I HOLLERED TO DWAYNE, TO STEP ON IT, WHEN WE SAW THIS THING FINALLY MOVE This resident inquired if we did foot patrols through his community? Which was at the time was sparsley populated On the south side of the river, squatting at the edge of the water was a large dark haired skunk ape It had about 3 inches of hair hanging down from the wrist area that was longer than the rest of the hair on its arm  This thing was walking fast, with a deliberate stride and a slight forward stance The friend of mine noticed a set of eyes shining in the woods while looking down a small trail It was much taller than any living thing I had seen before It was a warm day in June of 2005 it was around noon and me and three of my friends decided to go fishing we had cooked left over pork chops as bait since where we were fishing on private property and we were tresspassing I have been reluctant to say anything about this, after about an hour or two of fishing the older of my two friends said ""Hey (name) I think theres a bear in those pallmetos."" So I being the oldest of the three decided to go over to the bushes and check it out when I got about ten feet from the bushes I saw two dark brown eyes filled fear and curiosity I stopped dead in my tracks and then the creature let out a loud grumbleing noise so naturally being as terrefied as I was I let out a yell which is when I saw the creatures eyes go from fear and curiosity to rage and anger then it rose out of a crouching position to tower about nine feet above me I can distinctly remeber the odor coming off the creature and around the eyes there was no fur the creature also had a very noticible mark on it face right above the upper lip I cant remeber if it was the left or right side, the creature had a flat nose kind of like a gorilla and human mix the skin was really dark and course the creature had extremely long arms and also there was no hair around the lips the fur was really dark and notted sort of like a matted dog Bigfoot that I was fortunate enough to have encountered one The hair was long and silky not matted or tangled The tree is about 25 to 30 feet tall We had a large fire pit about 4 feet across and we had a big fire going It was like a person of color whose skin is darker than the sides of their feet These eyes were in the middle of the window, so whatever it was had to have been tall enough to be able to look in The way the fences are all I could hear were like footsteps moving along the fence toward the trees I saw one shadow really dark moving along the fenceline...it wasn't a person because the shoulders were way too wide and bulky and it wasn't even fully upright I looked just past the spot where it was in the road and it was on the side of the road and was bending down a limb from a 4 or 5 foot pine tree peering out at me Once it stood up it looked to be about 6 foot tall  Brock explained that her children would often claim that they saw a bigfoot creatures around their property and in the swamps Once it rose up completely on two legs, its head was obscured by the tree branches above, while at the same time, its feet and legs were obscured by the saw palmetto and other bushes below  He said the thing was at least 7 or so feet tall hiding behind bushes just staring at him one night  For example, either his hair was very, very bushy, or this guy didn't have much of a neck It looked about 6'6"" to 7' tall, long arms, very hairy, resembled a man more then an animal I was on a gravel pad about 2.5 to 3 foot higher than it was He stated that, ""its hands hung almost to its knees and it moved in a hunched posture."" When questioned further, the witness stated that it moved with its knees bent in ""almost a glide"" and that its arms stayed by its side as opposed to swinging back and forth It had long arms and  I could see the eyes a little, it was at least 6 ½ feet tall and around 250 lbs That night for dinner we cooked chicken legs and turkey meatballs over the fire 7 feet off the ground ""(The prints) had a full four feet of distance between each of one,"" he said, speculating that if they were real the creature that made them must be 10-to-12 feet tall and weigh close to 1,000 pounds I kept wondering what a tall, naked, hairy “man” was doing out in the woods at that time (or any time) of the day They interviewed the driver and a couple of riders who stated seeing a large hair-covered animal walking upright near the edge of an island in the swamp 8 feet tall and had obviously articulated muscles as it moved from the edge of the road, down a gully and into the tree line In front of me crossing the road was bigfoot it stopped just off center on the road I will never forget the chills that ran up me when I heard theses sounds.The next morning we did check the area and we did find weird type footprints that looked not like human nor were they a bear or any other type of animal that I am familar with Suddenly as we sat there, we heared what sounded like footsteps What I saw was slim and covered in reddish brown hair I was driving on the far right side of the highway in a heavily tropical wooded area when I saw what I first thought was a man walking fast about 50 feet away from the highway in like a grassy meadow with thick brush or tropical woods behind him The moon light source was behind the creature, so consequently eyes or facial features were not discernable 160lb male & 100lb female), 3 black bear, a bobcat and a 13 foot aggressive alligator in the middle of the road and numerous snakes and other alligators It sounded bipedal and it's steps were louder than mine Right as I flipped on the lightbar, and it shone down the road, I noticed a large creature moving across the road on two legs  The fur was not especially dark and was certainly not black We all got out, checked out the trailer, checked the passenger side of the car, looked for a corpse, looked for blood, looked for hair, but found nothing at all! The best I remember we even turned around and drove back past the point of impact but saw nothing! It will be passed off as a bear, (I am certain), but I do not believe a bear could possibly be that big, move that fast, or suffer that kind of impact without being injured I had heard, from time to time, about Bigfoot in the Pacific Northwest, but this was the farthest thing from my mind that day across the shoulders, covered with dark brown hair with a Reddish tint standing on two legs We later went back and found a brown/red hair hanging from the bottom of a branch.  the thing that got us both was the red eyes that almost glowed in the dark The doors had not been installed yet no more footsteps but more harsh breathing My two sons saw Big Foot at Buck Lake, Ocala National Forest, a couple years earlier. As we off loaded our equipment and cleared the overpass rails we headed down the side of the overpass; we were shining flashlights around the pond  to make sure we didn't step on any snakes or gators, something screamed at us (now mind you that there was only about 2 to 3 feet of space between the pond and dense woods i can't imagine how something can even get in there)  with such intensity that i felt my chest rattle my heart almost stopped; it felt like whatever this was was right in front of us and it did not want us there!! we are not  amateurs we both were carrying high powered hand guns  and could not locate what this creature was or where it was yet it felt like it was right in front of us Just watched a TV show which made reference to the Skunk Ape/Bigfoot of Florida  At the edge of the woods was what appeared to be a bear, but it had red eyes 41 when she observed a creature, that she indicated was approximately 1000 feet in front of her car, cross the road Then loud thrashing and intentionally loud moving about from just within the treeline, in the trees and behind 6 foot reeds/brush just on the other side of the drainage ditch between the road and woods  About 2-3 blocks from the intersection of Koala and Collingswood we stopped and saw what I first thought was a very large dog, on all four legs, in the swale about 20 ft Suddenly I heard it very close to my head, no more than a feet away, and it sniffed deeply several times as if it was checking me out Her feet hit the floor upstairs at the same time mine hit downstairs...We assumed a bear, but never could figure out why a bear would hit the house and how it could hit hard enough to shake the house, waking us both up.  It made the hair on the back of our necks stand up the dir, it was heading.it was dark colored, to far away to see a face I grew up in the area and had covered on foot, horse, swamp buggy, canoe, etc He turned a corner from one trail to another, and ""bigfoot"" was standing at the intersection of the two trails The knees almost hit the ground before it came up again and out to the side of its foot. I thought I was seeing things but it was a reddish brown hairy arm The stride was long, maybe about 3 1/2 to 4 ft tall) it was completely black and had breasts It had hair that was brownish/red in color.This was not a bear Even though we live in the country we do have a few houses around us and the only thing that I could come up with is that it had to be some kid messing around and at that time I became mad and yelled "" you might think messing around here playing games is fun but I'll tell you I have a gun and someone could very well get hurt messing around like this in the dark"" When I turned around I say a bipedal ape-like thing looking from behind a tree I can't think of too many kids with feet that big It happend so quik that it was a blurr, but i do know that the hair was a dark brown or black color Had us pretty scared as my car was parked just 100 feet we had seen it  As we were passing East at Long Creek I looked to the left and saw what looked like a pile of dark Spanish moss looking grass It was running upright on two legs Finally, I couldn't even confirm his skin color, because I literally only saw dark brown over his entire body, including his hands Both guys put their foot in the print and it was way bigger than their foot in width and length couldnt be a persons foot I haven't seen anything but I've heard yells and growls that have made my neck hair stand up in the past The hair was very thick on the arms and shoulders but less so around the side belly and back areas ""I'm six feet tall and it was bigger than me It was not a man, it was entirely too tall The comment was made by more then two people that it sounded as thought it was on two legs It never made a sound, but it tilted its head back and forth like it was trying to figure me out during the time it watched me..I have sinced purchased a camcorder, but I haven't seen it again..the one I saw, I would guess it was about six to six and one half feet tall Just to describe the location a bit; this wooded area had a nice canopy of trees and was somewhat darkened even in the bright daylight It was out of view previously, as I was able to later conclude, because it had been in a completely prostate position in or behind about 3 or 4 feet of saw palmetto It was black or very dark The closest I came to one of them was about a foot, I walked up on it On all fours it stood about 21/2 or three feet tall. Honestly I had never heard of a Skunk Ape in my life, squatches and bigfoots yes I had, but being from New Mexico I had never heard of a Skunk Ape It scared my dad so bad that he stalled the truck trying to get out of there! As I look back on it that probably was not the proper response but things happen  I stopped a thousand foot away or so and there she was as I looked back, standing in the middle of the road of which I just passed peering in the opposite direction Newspaper article: Sentinel Star (Orlando, Florida), October 5, 1977 LURKING BIGFOOT TRICK OR THREAT? Halloween is still three weeks away but strange creatures are already being seen around Central Florida this week I started to get a little frightened, because the area where the footsteps were coming from was a thicket of Brazilian peppers - difficult to walk through during the day, and nearly impossible to manage in the night I was stunned to see that which I had assumed would be a raccoon, actually stood at least 6 to 7 feet tall, walked on two legs, and was covered with brown hair, (was somewhat skinny) The bigfoot ran about 100 yards across the road in abount 20 seconds It had stopped at the edge of the road and must have eaten bay tree blossoms because up about 10 to 12 feet in the tree you could see where it took the blossoms and there were pieces of the blossoms on the ground I started heading back the way I had come and within 200 yards of the table were some bare foot prints that appeared human At first, I thought it was some big man walking through the saw palmetto; it was definitely bipedal, which is what threw me later IT HAD TO HAVE BEEN LARGE BECAUSE AS IT RAN 10 TO 20 YRDS INTO THE BRUSH, IT WAS SHACKING AND PUSHING TREES OUT OF THE WAY.AND THESE TREES WERE DICENTLY THICK(A GOOD 6 INCHES).IT STOPPED ABOUT 30YRDS IN AND GAVE OFF A WIERD BISTURBING (IN MY BEST DISSCRIPTION) A GROWLING SNARL.ITS HARD TO DISCRIB.THATS WHEN I YELL **** THIS AND RAN BAC TO CAMP.I COULD HARDLY FIND MY WAY BACK TO CAMP MY FRIENDS HAD TO HELP ME.THE BEST PART OF THE CREATURE I SAW WAS PARTALLY THE BACK OF ITS HEAD to 8 ft.tall, about 3 1/2 ft  My eyes are darting down to the road, up ahead the highway looking for the tow truck, back to the monstrous mess in the road About 30 minutes later we heard another load crunch and right behind a pine tree we looked and another 80 yards out heading towards the bottom we see the same large hairy human figure turning and heading deeper into the creek bottom. I was talking with a dear friend who really is into the bigfoot movement and she told me that it HAD to be a bigfoot as bears do not run upright and really I guess I knew that  After it got about 50 yards closer I alerted my wife to ""turn around"" because I realized that this was not your ""average jogger."" It walked with a smooth, long stride with arms swinging about two feet in front and back I actually put my foot in its prints as i walked deeper into the swamp  I ran over and went into the creek, only about a foot deep, to see if I could catch up with him, but there was not a trace It was dark, red long hair.  It had such a thick build with gray hair or fur covering all of its body"
Georgia,"This is my second sighting of bigfoot in the same state about 40 miles from my first sighting  Further, the legs and rear were much too thin to be that of a bear  I admittedly have bad eyesight though, even with glasses on at night THE HOWLING LASTED ABOUT 15 SECONDS ( THE WHOLE TIME I WAS WALKING BACKWARDS TOWARDS MY HOUSE )THE WHOLE TIME I WAS WALKING AWAY I NEW WHAT EVER WAS MAKING THAT SOUND WAS VERY BIG AND I WAS VERY SCARED, (I DONT SCARE EASY , IM A 6 FOOT 300LB MAN )  I WENT INSIDE MY HOME AND LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW FOR A WHILE AND NEVER HEARD OR SEEN ANYTHING AFTER I GOT INSIDE   and realized that we had heard tales of Big Foot in this area and after researching what we saw, we know 100% that we saw him I felt the vibration under my feet when it moved Then I noticed it was over 7 foot 6 inches tall covered in long black hair The hair was almost dread like, it was long and matted I could see it moving for about 5 to 6 feet before it came to a tree where it stepped out from behind the tree and looked directly at me  However, as I watched from 50 feet I noticed the complete absence of a tail It was all covered in black hair and its arms were dangling to its sides, which is what made me notice it in the first place.I'd say it was over 8 feet tall He said it was about 8 1/2 ft to 9 ft tall, greyish in color I walked back up the embankment expecting to see people,, what I saw in broad day light, probably 30-40yds directly in front of me was what I can only describe as what appeared to be a fully erect gorilla, except his face didn't protrude out,it was flatter,and the hair was the color of a squirrel, browns, black, silver & a slight tint of red when the sun reflected off him.He was standing there, head slightly tilted back, squinting his eyes,soaking up the sunshine, just as I was.I couldn't comprehend what I was looking at at first   I have seen big foots on our property,  wood knocks so loud it scared me to death  I will never forget the experience and because of it, I am especially interested in Bigfoot. The creature was standing completely still with its long arms hanging at its sides The one thing that I saw that I will never forget was its 2 big yellow eyes that were staring straight at me  I was 12 or 13 at the time when I  had 3 different encounters within about 2 weeks’ time with something that I now believe to be Bigfoot it sounded like whatever it was started getting closer.when all of a suuden we all seen limbs from the magnolia trees moving and out step this figure into the fire light.it took 2 more steps, then we all could plainly see it.it was around 6'5'' or 7' tall with a huge broad chest maybe 3' wide It was about 45 minutes after dark,we were standing out in the driveway close to the road away from the house  Near Griffen GA a bigfoot was seen by a home owner and a police officer got a good imprint of the large foot print  Near where Austin Bridge intersects Mein Mitchell Road; we saw what I would describe as an animal with the basic body structure of a bear but standing on it's hind legs;  and a face that seemed more wolfish than anything else Perhaps as close as 200 feet It took 2 strides and it was gone All I could see was the silhouette of a person/thing, but it stood 1 1/2 to 2 feet over the top of the fence He related that he could close his eyes and still hear that scream and he could feel his hairs standing up I observed a large, upright form, dark gray in appearance on two legs cross the road in front of me As it was getting dark, they headed back to their truck I stayed until it was completely dark and I fished my flash light out of my backpack It was dark brown in color and had matted hair covering it's body Terrible smells like I can't explain and foot prints in fields While we were in there one old horse that stays in at night was in his stall and he would NOT calm down for anything, not even food! He circled in his stall yelling for 45mins It was getting dark and the terrain was getting to difficult to continue and I had no light The deer carcass was gone, but hair and intestines were left behind I thought it was a man at first, but it was too large, too dark, and fleeting It was at least 9 feet tall and about 4 feet across at the shoulders It was middle of summer and the Mosquitoes were really bad so I decided to wait until after dark to go because they usually calm down after sunset Both of them are avid deer and turkey hunters with primitive weapons and firearms and have spent a great deal of time in the woods Bud said it had to be a werewolf for the longest, till I said it had to be bigfoot. What I saw was a tall, lanky , humanoid  creature that looked almost ""helmeted"" because of the way the head hair fell straight down similar to a woman with long straight hair  While that corner of the yard is dark and lights barely shine there from the windows, there was definitely nothing taller than the fence and nothing that looked like a head and shoulders  Seemingly walking straight at us was a 7 foot or large large black creature I couldn't see any facial features or individual features of hands or feet Place: Cherokee County, Georgia Conditions: Clear, Crisp Weekday Morning I live in Cheokee County, Georgia in a semi-rural area of small horse farms and subdivisions It had hair all over its body  Suddenly, the heavy bi-pedal footsteps once again began to stalk us in the brush as it did when I was by myself This to me was clearly not a bear,as much as I have been in the woods I have never seen anything like this ever! We all five got real scared and jumped in the truck, which was facing towards the house.We watched it go around the house towards the left,as it went it looked in the windows on that side of the house,then it disapeared in the darkness.We tried to tell our parents what we saw but no one would belive us,they tried to tell us it was a bear,but we knew better Again no sightings but interesting because nobody actually spotted the ""bear"" either! And lastly along the mountain road at a heigth of 9-10 feet off the ground there was a 4 inch sappling rung and twisted completely around! My dad once spent 3 months in the woods living off the land in the late seventies in north Georgia  Once we exited our truck, we found a shallow hole that was about three to four feet in diameter that appeared to be an old fire pit Whatever it was, it was big! We could hear it walking in a steady crunch-crunch that sounded to me like it was walking on two feet As we headed toward this shadow it took off running still on 2 feet toward the new graveyard  I figured that something was propped up against the fence and just looked like a head and shoulders in the dark and that maybe the hair was some spanish moss caught on whatever it was The creature was probably close to six/seven feet tall But as I approached the object I saw this was either a GIANT of a man in a shaggy fur coat, or a HUGH animal I had never seen! It was standing on two feet, and its arms were long, this I noticed as it turned its head toward the car, it dropped one arm to its side  Back then there was a lot of tall grass and bushes between our house and the road behind our house; it runs along under a high power line path, with just a small trail going from our back yard to the road behind our house When it came up on our side of the gulley I saw a large ape/man like hairy creature jogging toward us on the path on two legs  I am not saying it was a bigfoot, because I could not see it well enough to say that for certain, but I don't think it was a person The sound was so strange and unnerving that he said the hair on his arms and neck stood up All I could see was the silhouette of the shoulders and head and hair sticking up over the fence I could see the foot falls & the thigh muscles bounce Next came a loud scream from the same area, I looked and saw a pair of eyes It was about 8 1/2 feet tall, massive in size and covered in red hair IT HAD SHORT LIGHTER BROWN HAIR ON IT'S HANDS JUST LIKE IT'S FACE.IT HAD LONGER REDDISH BROWN HAIR FROM IT'S WRIST ALL THE WAY DOWN IT'S ARM As we turned around there was a big ten foot log (about the diameter of a car tire) laying there It stopped short of the edge of the creek and was behind the bushes standing about 7-8 feet tall My friend who had heard the sounds the weekend before came back to camp with matted hair he had found near his stand and when unrolled some of these were almost 20 inches in lenght The body except for the Face and Palms of the hands were covered with  neat short (one inch)dark brown to black hair flecked with gray hair It was still too large to be human, wider and thicker muscled than a man but not as stocky as the Patterson footage, that is why I say it may not be heavier. It was about 7 to 8 feet tall It was obvious it was a footprint because you could see the toes in the clay It kept movin its head around tryin to get the light out of its eyes I could tell the sounds were close, by the brushes and leaves making a noise and with a few mins I could hear it passed under my tree, I tried to shine my light but it was useless with the fog and darkness.Whatever it was, it continued on pass me still making those sounds Several months later he told he had someone at the U of Georgia look at them and was told the were not horse or pig hair but without further testing they couldnt determine  I saw something about 7.5 - 8' tall step out from behind a tree, swaying back and forth looking at me from either side of the tree  I seen this tall figure (roughly 6 feet to 7 feet in height)turn and stare at my headlights I then looked out the window to see a large thing, well over six feet tall, covered in hair right below the window He covered his face from the head lights, he took about 2 steps into the side of the road where there was a fence post about 5 to 6 feet tall, put his left hand on the fence post and easily hopped over the fence and took off His arms were huge, like the size of thighs, they were very long I could see his face looked human but wasn`t, he was all black but face and hands looked like dark grey, his hair was all black long and matted, had dark eyes and very strong massive arms and legs. The witness told them that it was taller than himself, and he saw the silhouette and the eyes as it kept moving towards him This thing was completly hairy and it's face was dark but I could tell it was human-like because its head was like that of a human head but hair all over - but not on the face The arms were longer than any human arms Over the years since I have come to realize that the Bigfoot egnima is world wide, in all wild places. We first thought it was a rock that had rolled of the side of the steep terrain when suddenly a large black/brown human like creature was slashing at the water with it's long arms  As we sat there on or bikes we could see the bushes and tall reeds swaying back and forth I can't come up with any other thing that could be that tall and that could do what it did I do recall its face was hairy, not smooth I would estimate, given that the fence is about 6 feet tall, that it was at least 7 1/2 to 8 1/2 feet tall  We have no idea what we saw and don't have the time to really investigate, however, we know that it was at least as large as a large grown man, walked on two feet, had weired looking long arms, and didn't show it's face to us It was late afternoon and she was coming around a curve in the road, when a tall (6-7) ft tall hairy biped slowly crossed the road in front of her car, almost causing her to wreck I began to walk in the direction of the other person to say hello and that is when it stood up and I could obviously tell the thing was about 9 to 10 feet tall Dark hairy color and was standing on 2 legs IT WAS COVERED WITH LONG HAIR FROM HEAD TO TOE  But as we looked closer it was only on 2 legs instead of 4 In addition to three-toed tracks, we found a series of tracks that looked like the bare feet of children! following our trail of footprints - I am convinced to this day that the creature that had screamed at us was probably a female - with babies! This was the only time we found a trail of tracks I didn't get a clear look it happened so quick, but whatever it was was big (if it was a side view like I assume from the direction of travel it was thick maybe 2 foot) I remember in detail, his face was distorted almost, and darker Experiance #2 A friend and myself were on Kinchafoonee Creek in Lee Co.between the bridge at HWY.32 walking up the middle of the creek fishing  towards Pinewood Rd.This area is covered in very thick woods on both sides of the creek with no houses around.I had told my friend about the bigfoot creature I had seen 2 weeks earlier on the creek,who was not with me when we saw it It was actually very quiet it didnt make a sound before we saw it stand and we didnt hear it land or stride away, as if it was stalking or observing us! Of course we were all extremely scared after seeing it initially It was a big creature, 7-8 feet tall, and crossed the road from left to right in 4 steps It was pitch dark and dead silent except for this tremendous whoop Back in May 1998, I  had taken my first trip to the North Georgia Mountains, specifically the Tallullah Gorge area  I don't think it was a bigfoot but it was something weird like a werewolf  As I road my bike along the road I noticed that when I would get to this one spot there appeared to be something in the tall grass making a loud deep grunting sound The last footsteps that lead into the woods from the red clay were so enormous that I began to observe them Another time we had found, further back in the woods, a large footprint shape with no discernable features such as toes, etc NOTHING ELSE COULD HAVE BEEN 7 FEET TALL OR THE SAME COLOR IT WAS.THIS HAS LED ME TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS SOMETHING LIVING IN THE WOODS BEHIND MY HOUSE. There were footprints around other than ours, however, we didn't see anybody from the start of the trailhead and throughout the hike I would guess within 750 feet After about 15 seconds past, he and I both screamed out, ""did you just see what I saw???"" I have never been a big believer in the legend of Bigfoot, but I know what I saw tonight And it had long hair or fur on it's head I could see the body and head, with the body extending down into the grass which is about 3' tall Not scared, almost home, never had heard of Bigfoot  Its eyes glowed red in the headlights While preparing to check inside the brush that ringed the stream inlet area, a large man/ape creature,10' to 10'6"" tall (estimated weight 1100 lbs.) approached me with an unhurried pace at a distance of approximently 20 feet I think I might have seen a big foot on May 30, 2012 I saw a very dark brown/black constant colored tall humanoid figure standing on the left shoulder of the road , quarter facing toward the road and toward the direction of our travel Said it even frightened him and he is a seasoned hunter of many years! My story may sound make fake, but believe me, I know exactly what I saw that day and it was a living, breathing Bigfoot. I think it has run the bigfoot on to our property It had wide hips, and its arms were almost to its knees At about halfway to the other town (Meldrim,Ga.) it looked as though the light at the far end of the tracks was getting brighter.We pulled off the side and backed up to the ditch that parallels the railroad bed to wait to see if the light got brighter.While waiting my wife and friends sat and talked and I climbed back onto the tracks on foot to watch the light On the other side we found another in the mud, which appeared to be the opposite foot As we got past it I realized with the height of our sequoia and its chest being in the door window it had to be 8 feet tall or more  That is when we saw it come out from the reeds, it was massive, hairy from head to toe standing upright like a man, but not a man These two footprints were several feet away from each other! A BIG step! I have a picture of the second print It started to move towards the road walking on two legs That is when we heard the animal scream and run toward us by the sound of the stomps in the leaves! Afterwards, we discussed what could possibly have made such noises!? A monster? What? We did not know, but somewhere in the conversation, the possibility of a bigfoot came up, and that seemed more plausible to our fourteen year old minds He was walking upright with long strides, his arms hung down to his knees, and his head was extremely large THAT'S WHEN I SAW A LARGE BROWN HAIRY CREATURE.I COULD SEE ABOUT HALF OF IT'S HEAD, DUE TO THE CAGE PART OF THE KENNEL.IT HAD VERY LONG REDDISH BROWN HAIR GOING FROM IT'S FORHEAD DOWN AS FAR AS I COULD SEE The body was all big boned muscle, no body fat and had thick arms and legs It had to way around 800 lbs., It really looked like a big human covered in long shaggy black hair My oldest brother called into the woods thinking it may be a lost hunter, but there was no response.We walked about another 20 yards and the foot falls continued.This became a big concern due to the fact that what ever was walking in the woods would eventually meet us going to our vehicle due to the shape of the trail, cutting us off from our vehicle tall and weigh between 200 and 300 pounds This was no deer and I don't think it was a bear unless it was walking on two legs I am almost 6 feet tall and my head doesn't come above the sequoia.  I noticed they were of a person walking barefoot, at least 18 inches in length and about 5 inches wide A huge, 7 foot tall, ape-looking creature that was covered in tangled hair As we passed by the church we noticed this big shadow standing (on two feet) under the light tall,looked to be about 400-500 pounds, walking upright with a slight stoup or slump at the shoulders, but the shoulders were very wide,coverd in hair I caught a glimpse of something very dark colored and man sized running towards the backside of the Island It was getting dark, summer, and we were heading home  Since he did not believe me, I made him a challenge to go into the woods with me where I had heard the footsteps The foliage was mostly dense tall pine trees with all kinds of honey suckles and black berry vines and muscidine vines  I had never heard of Bigfoot and just thought it was some big person walking around barefoot enjoying the mud (red Clay) 8 to 10 feet tall and covered in hair you could see the front of the house real good because of the night light right in front of the house.where we stood was dark being away from the light.As we talked we noticed something come around the right side of the house,the only way to come from the direction it came was to cross the creek that bordered the back yard  This creature called Bigfoot automatically came to my mind because I knew it had to be powerful to produce that sound The gorund around it was totally dry, but the ""chewed"" bark was slimmy wet, like spit IT WAS ABOUT 5 1/2 FEET TALL I stopped and turned my light on and tried to shine it on the thing, but it began to turn away from me as it took very long strides as it walked on two legs Its stride was long, he covered a country two lane road approximately 18 feet in width with probably 3 steps This thing's chest alone filled the entire window and its arms were straight down  I could see that the rear legs appeared longer than the front, and the head was closer to the ground It was about 80 yards away and I knew that if it started running, it could probably easily run me down as it had extremely long, gangly legs This is where we noticed what looked like very fresh,really  big foot prints crossing the sand bar.This made us stop right there and head back very quickly for or vehicles I took the other two guys to show them, and on the way there we saw a footprint in the mud that looked like someone walking barefoot except it was appro  I also noticed on the red clay of the ground some big footsteps that came from the Officers Housing into the edge of the woods where I was walking into He said he could not open the trap, so he was going to cut his foot off As this happened, I jumped off the saddle onto the horses neck, let go of the reins and puit my arms around the horses neck I had left my gun in the truck and only had my pocket knife to cut the lines-as I worked with the lines I heard a sound I had never heard before very deep very loud breathing then I smelled a strange smell the smell made me feel uneasy I was unable to see anything but as I backed towards the truck it moved out into a clearing and I was able to see it from about 10 feet The sun had already set, but it wasn't dark yet, twilight I wondered how and why this could occur, but after my sighting, I knew that the Bigfoot had killed these young calves as well as some of a neighbor farmer's goats  Needless to say, I had trouble sleeping and did not ever sleep with my window open!  I have continuously had nightmares about Big Foot even to this day!  It is good to read other stories such as mine. THIS LARGER KENNEL WAS AT LEAST 6 FEET TALL  As we stopped, heavy footsteps began to run towards us Anyways they rushed back to the truck and on the way outta there the guy tells him that he saw what was suppose to be a myth, a sasqautch.The guy doesnt go in the woods at dark, if he goes hunting, and he tells me the guy has never been back there hunting The reason I think it is a bigfoot is because there is some property behind ours, and they have been clearcuting all of it It never turned to look at me and just loped across the road and off in the dark The creature stopped aproximately 30 to 40 feet from our tent.(Our tent was in a small valley, and wouldnt be visible to someone coming from the backside of the Island unil they were upon it.)There was a minute or two of complete silence His legs and torso seemed normal (as compared to a human) but his arms were longer Whatever it was, the hair on my neck still stands when I think about the tree shaking after it leapt to the ground It was getting dark, but the moon was full These little pine trees were taller than him I WOKE UP MY WIFE THE NIGHT THIS HAPPENED AND ASKED HER IF ANY APES HAVE ESCAPED FROM THE ZOO OR CIRCUS THAT I MIGHT OF MISSED ON THE NEWS AND SHE SAID NO .I DIDNT THINK  AT THE TIME THE HOWL I HEARD WAS A BIGFOOT UNTIL I HEARD SOME SOUND CLIPPINGS AND READ MY NEIGHBORS REPORT NUMBER 14887 At the same time we bothe looked up above us and there was a Bigfoot standing 10-15 feet from us As it took off you could hear the foot steps, very heavy  I left immediately because I was frightened and came home to look on the internet for bigfoot sounds The thing I call Bigfoot was ripped, very strong While he was doing that 2 of us were in a stall with an other horse and something hit the outside of the barn right at that stall It's arms were were like 5 gallon buckets at the bicep  It was so tall it seemed to walk hunched over dragging its arms This creature cleared the road in three steps at a normal stride My first impression of it being a man was because of the general shape, but the dark figure wasn't wearing clothes and had to be over 10ft It appeared to be over seven feet tall It stood on its back legs and appeared to be brownish to dark brown with some lighter brown to grey around the facial area   It had to be about 9 feet tall I steadily began to walk out of the woods and as I did, I could hear the heavy bi-pedal footsteps stalking me from the left, deeper in the woods from where I was at  I found on the Oregon Bigfoot site the sound  As it ran it appeared to be taking what looked like 8 to 9 foot steps from left leg to right leg, it ran upright just like a man swinging its massive arms back and forth, and the dogs didn’t stand a chance at catching it The shoulders were broad and squared and its long arms swung from side to side as it walked at a very fast pace Its starting to get dark and as we come to a straight away about a half a mile long with pastures on both sides of us fenced in, I see something big and black in front of us about 10 to 20 yards in my lane of the road I thought it was a cow so i slammed on the brakes at that time this figure (BIGFOOT) stood up from a crouched position standing about 8ft tall with long black hair turned and looked at us He appeared to be 6 foot 2 to 6 foot 4 it was 8:30 am me and jody was going fishing and when we got there a camper was there and a few people so he got out and was talking to them and i went to the side of the pond where trees where in the water to bass fish i was there about 10 minutes when the hair on my neck stood up i looked around but didnt see any thing so i went back to fishing and i could feel someone watching me so i turned around and at the top of the bank behind me i saw it standing there watching me its hair was reddish brown the top of its leg was about the size of my chest and im 44 inches in the chest it was the biggest thing i ever saw id say between 9 to 10 feet tall as i was looking up its body it turned and started to walk away i never got to its face to see it but the size was breath taking i froze in my tracks i couldnt yell i couldnt move i was just there and on a 12 foot back it was just standing there it never made a sound i dont know if it was there when i walk up to fish or if it come up on me but i never heard any noise I will be more than happy to explain more about my Bigfoot sighting IT HAD AN ARM THAT WAS ABOUT 3 FEET LONG The skin was a dark grayish color around the face, head was extremely pointed, like a dunce hat almost, no neck,large pectorals visible under the hair Also saw butt muscles flex all under the hair My wife and I were returning from TMT Farms Christmas display when a bigfoot crossed the road in front of us But this was not a cow, I know what I saw, he was on two feet walking and hopped a fence and ran toward the woods She said it looked like a bear on two legs walking, with the face of a gorilla It was very large, around 7-8 feet When I had reached the part of the trail that forked off into an open field of tall grass/wheat like stuff, that is where he stopped Tall and moved rapidly from left to the right side of the road NOTHING WAS THERE! It was very dark and my son started throwing horseshoe in the direction of the noise It looked like a bipedal ape! It had something white in its hand! That's when it registered it had hands and not claws Saturday morning, opening day, I made my way to my tree stand around 5am,a dense fog was beginning to roll in off the lake and with the darkness and fog, visibility was zero even with a flaslight For years we would find crazy things out there that just didn't make sense like trees bent over and I remember a big hole like 20 feet deep maybe 40 feet wide round We were walking into the woods but were still within eyesight of two houses and a field They both fumbled with their guns trying to reload and to get in the truck as it was almost full dark by then After probably 5 seconds the rustling stopped and it was totally silent As we began to walk up the hill, there were sounds of heavy foot falls in the woods on the side of the trail But the thing was very tall, possiblly 8 feet It picked up speed and started to run still on two legs Just 1 simple stride from this giant thing and it was out of sight of the opening We found no foot prints but the brush had obviously been disturbed, there were also several stones by the side of both tents that seemed to have been thrown there IT HAD SHORT LIGHTER BROWN HAIR ON WHAT I COULD SEE OF IT'S FACE This creature appeared through the thermal sight to be one constant color from head to foot, have no clothes on and to be fairly tall, approximately 7-9 feet This was about 3:30 pm with about 3 hours of light left as it is getting dark about 6pm It came up out of the ditch when I was about 20 or 30 feet away from it  Only the hair would move It was his eyes that I remember most  6-7 ft tall covered in hair walking on 2 legs like a man I thought at first it might be a tree or bush, but it had a discernable head, arms, torso, and legs I herd a noise that sounded like foot steps in the woods Never before have any of us seen, heard ,or even thought about bigfoots being in these woods,ever! My father and I had just purchased a set of 2 way motorola radios to communicate between each other while hunting The distance it covered was about 15 feet and it did it in a second and made no noise We saw the top of its head which was a reddish brown with hair covering its facial features There was one street lamp on a telephone pole down there near the end of the road on the left side, and it was under this lamp that we noticed a large, cone-shaped dark area It was more like a positive defensive move.The face was rather like a Gorilla(Dark skin and Dark deep set eyes, the head sloped back and was neanerthal shaped, had no eyebrows,prominent lips but not protruding, jutting square chin, no ears or teeth were seen,prominent nostrils slight nose (not flat like a gorilla) and an aged look to the face That's when I seen the hair fade into short close hair So if I apply this to what I remember seeing when I was younger this creature was absolutely huge at least 8 feet tall and weighing easily 550 pounds! It was tall but had a slightly more narrow build in shoulder area width than the animal in the Patterson film Typically while looking through the thermal sight at a person you can distinguish clothing, hair, equipment they may be wearing, etc and be able to judge their height with the surroundings they are standing in  At first glance I would have thought my eyes to be playing tricks I started to notice that it was getting late, and my father had told me that he did not want me in those woods after dark She had seen the same thing and even told me that whatever it was had reddish eyes We have found 3 foot prints, these are NOT ""giant size"", but they are much larger than human THIS THING IN THE WOODS HOWLED AND STOPPED THEN A SECOND ONE HOWLED AND STOPPED NOT MOORE THEN 75 FEET AWAY At around 6 foot tall it looked wet as if it had came from the river it also had green river scum on its left leg and side I watched a show on The Discovery Channel (I think) a while back and they played a supposed recording of a Bigfoot, then I realized this was exactly what I heard After I had finished hunting at just about dark - 7PM or so.I stopped back to see if I had any catfish this is on a winding private dirt at least a mile and a half from my uncles home There was this rock about thirty feet into the woods from the power line If I see or hear any thing else I will send you more info, but from what I have already heard I think it is a bigfoot I hit my brakes and realized that it was wearing no clothes and was covered in hair like a bear, but it walked upright and hunched more like a man or a huge ape like thing I really do not know what to say but the most important thing to me is trying to protect this animal, aka Bigfoot THE HAIR COLOR ALMOST SEEMED GRAYISH It had a HAND- not a paw.the hands were huge will hair on them and long nails The creature was estimated to be seven foot tall, and quite skinny  It was Auburn-Brown and had very wirey hair He had sharp pointy features and darker hair was on the top of his head and down the back of his neck, spreading across his shoulders to about the shoulder blades and fading out It was very tall, about 7 or 8 feet, and had long brown hair that covered it's entire body  The hole was about 10 foot in diameter and about a foot deep, it looked as though it had been dug out by hand there was also strands of long dark hair all around in the hole  He observed them leading into the woods and said to me that the prints must be those of the Bigfoot monster We got scared, as the sound had come from only 50-75 feet behind us in the swampy part of the bottoms As we were about three hundred feet from the creature, it appeared dark grey like a shadow Also later on through the years family members would come across very large foot prints and sometimes big red eyes looking in windows at night.  We drove up to our tee box and a friend yelled at me - ""Dave look there's a bigfoot.""  All of us were about forty yards or so from a large black creature walking from left to right up a slight hill The thing that got me was its reddish brown eyes The hair around his face and neck was very hairy and wirey looking (blackish-brown) with piercing eyes and it had teeth but missing some and all yellow On the way back around the field, we noticed a huge footprint As we got the fire roaring with flames licking about ten feet in the air, the thing finally moved out over the next ridge across the creek so as not to be seen  We were driving slower than usual because it was so dark and there wasn't alot of traffic on the road, making sure we didn't hit any deer I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes and sat up to listen Along the edge of the power line, for about a 20 foot stretch, there were tree limbs, about as round as my wrist, and a good 15-20 foot from the ground, broken and snapped off We both unassed the tent with our six volt headlights on and our shotguns at port arms The could feel the hairs on the back of my neck raise up and chills come over me I walked around a deadfall and about 40 to 50 feet from me it stood right in my path, on the trail,(footpath) Its arms were huge and long with massive hands He was at least 7-8 feet tall I seen his ribs, the muscles in his hips and thighs, and legs, and partly his back I still thought it was a very tall person until I got to within 20 feet of it and the smell became extremely bad It had a cinnamon- dark brown hairy looking body He  stepped in the door and grabbed a MAG light to take a look and when he did he saw a sillouette of a bipedal creature approx 8 foot tall and 75 yards away stand up near the pond and quickly run towards the neibors house which is to the right and behind him While on 301, about 10 minutes into it, I was driving at about 70-75 miles an hour when out of the dark, a black, hairy, tall thing crossed the road in front of us tall and had a huge head 3 times the size of a man's head and it stared at me as I passed by  Well Tiger started running around in circles and whimpering, I looked at my neighbor and asked him “what was wrong with your dog” and he said “he did not know he had never seen the dog do that.”  Well next thing we knew Tiger is tucking his tail between his legs and running all out for the house It never occurred to me until later that what I saw was a Bigfoot Hair was clean, looked groomed almost WE CAME DOWN A HILL CLOSE TO A SUBDIVISION, AND A TALL MUD RED CREATURE WALKED ACROSS THE ROAD IN FRONT OF US  While walking down the path near the Officers Housing area, I showed him the footprints in the red clay It stopped and turned towards me from about 60 feet away and took about 5-6 steps towards me in the bushes It was black and it had long hair, like a shaggy dog It was very dark with very scant traffic and we were the only car in sight The clear cut was located at the foot  of the southeast end of the Horse range mountain near Loudesville campground In White county Georgia We had a hand full of run ins with the sasquatch and his offspring.The first time we saw it was when it came up to my infant sisters window and she was mocking it,I think it got confused one night and went to my moms window and started grunting and scared my mom so bad she tried to climb up under my dad,he told her he thought it was probably a bear(that is until he saw it for himself)my mother went out to get the note off of the door and it was about ten feet at most away from her,she ran back inside and when she was able to speak she told my dad what she saw,my dad went into the bathroom and shot the larger one,One night we had acetylene tanks being thrown around by the larger one ,she said he was black,hair from head to toe,arms were past the waist line,nose was not like a gorillas,was more like human nose.We heard a noise outside one night and went out to look and found hair embedded into the wall of the outside of the house.It always came to the house at night,It was very curious,always looking into the windows,my aunt heard something one night and ran so fast that she actually put an indention into the wall of the house.My dad said one night all of my uncles came over and they were looking around the house for it and one of my uncles yelled down from the roof of the house that my dad was leaning against it,and when he turned around and looked up at it,it got spooked and beat the hood of the jeep and destroyed it.In our area where we lived there was always goats and cows etc..found with their intestines gone,no meat was eaten.It did always smell like a septic tank when it came around.We went outside the next day after an incident with it we went outside and our neighbor who owned cows had five cows laying on their sides,dead with their insides gone,next to the cow field where the pond was.Then when i was about fourteen years old we moved back to almost the exact spot we lived in when we had experienced it the first hand full of times,we cleared the woods across from where we lived before so we could put the trailer on the property,I was sleeping one night and thought my alarm went off,i checked it and apparently it was some other noise that woke me up,i looked out the window and saw an eight foot tall hairy creature running from my window,my dad went outside right away and did a cast of the foot print.We had a friend who was a game warden when we lived in west palm florida who went out and and was recording what she thought was a bear,she was in her vehicle out in the middle of the woods,on the recording we heard a howl like sound that was unlike anything we have ever heard,it sent chills up our spine,and then it started shaking her vehicle side to side,then it ran off.  The shoulders and arms were HUGE It's arms hung down at it's side as a human would It chased us and got to within probably 15 feet of us It was tall, not slim but not thick and covered in grayish - brownish hair While watching it I started noticing large yellow eyes that I assumed was an owl Bigfoot sighting If it was a person it was a very large, very tall, very hairy person It's eyes looked red, I guess from the glare of the head lights To date, I know it was the Bigfoot creature because of the footprints I had observed earlier in the red clay We saw a tall (about 7 feet tall), bulky, lumbering figure coming toward us, from about 30-40 feet away The crash site was small, about 100 feet by 30 feet because the Cobra crashed in one piece and then burned, so the whole area had that fuel smell and that ""burned flesh"" smell.  I then smelt something horrific and heard footsteps on the deck Then I heard them the next evening right before dark This huge rock had been recently overturned but the thing was about 4 or 5 feet wide by 3 feet tall The dirt road is approximately 15-20 feet wide It sounded like a horse running thru the woods (noise from the breaking of limbs and heavy foot steps pounding the ground) I would hesitate to call it an encounter because it was dark and from an undetermined distance I KNOW MOST SUPPOSEDLY SEEN BIGFOOT SIGHTINGS DON'T HAVE POINTY EARS, BUT IT'S WHAT I SAW  It was so large I could see its muscles in its legs (thighs) Stewart Ga we were conducting wargames my squad was moving through the woods when we started to hear a very low growl then a hi pitched scream as soon as we came out of the woodline to the south of my squad we saw what we thought was an an opposing force we were about 250 feet from the animal so be again to close in on it we called out twice to it and again we heard the growl it then stood up and we realized that it wasn't human it was between 7 and 8 foot tall and realizing that we were in danger we began to back away at this point it began throw rocks toward us and then took off there was about 300ft between it and the wood line and it took it about 20 seconds to make the distance the rest of the night we heard strange sounds from the woodline from what thought was multiple creatures The hair on the head was long and stringy, but the rest of the body hair seemed only two or three inches long and layed down rather than sticking out in a fuzzy fashion He was about 8 feet tall and way bigger than a cow The rest of his hair was lighter in color and was close to the skin, like a deer Seen, heard, smelled, footprints, etc  Just a few moments went by when I started to hear some heavy bi-pedal footsteps in the grass and leaves near me at about 50 ft Within 3-4 seconds after disappearing behind the cedar tree something big hit the water about 5 feet from the end if the dock where I was sitting and a fear came over me like nothing I've felt before  But we explained to her that it was no bear as it ran upright just like a man only taking huge strides, and that the dogs had no chance of catching it THIS WAS TOTALLY OUT OF CHARACTOR! I could hear something following along beside me but each time I stopped to look it was as if a flash of dark just ran by I shined the light in its face and saw two red eyes and a head and right shoulder The sound seemed to be about 50 feet away and moved from left to right out of range of my headlamp repeating this loud whoop IT HAD TO BE 7 FEET TALL BECAUSE IT WAS TALLER THAN THE KENNEL  I climbed up and it was still dark out, about 30 degrees When he woke me up to hear this we jokingly said ""maybe it's a bigfoot"" Am very familiar with Bigfoot and thought if I ever saw one it would be walking away or from a distance, and be a unique experience to remember for a lifetime, but it was nothing like this The vegetation was extremely thick in this area due to being a swamp and about 10-12 feet high I was sitting on the tailgate and my girlfriend a few feet away tending the fire As it was getting dark we set out with a map and compass My stand was about 40 feet into the woods from the power line near the overturned rock  We could not get him to step foot out from there The first thought that came to my head was a bigfoot I was sitting in a deer stand (box 12 foot high on stilts) about 0530 AM We started describing to each other what we had seen and the first thing I told her that it looked to me like it had reddish colored hair It was around 8' tall I was approaching the longest bridge between ROCKY FORD ROAD & Rt 53, I saw something that looked like very tall man standing near the side of the bridge  This thing was a good 9 feet tall with hair all matted to its body I have heard a strange “mournful howling” (as I’ve heard it described) several times in the middle of the night, but last night it was only 50 feet from my house at 2am When I stepped up on the step something came toward me so I back up to the front door and shined the flash light out back and it was a good 2ft above the deck with red eyes The figure was standing still,  very vertically erect with both arms loosely down at its sides We didn't notice if the foot falls continued, by this time we were all pretty scared and were working just to get back to our vehicle and go home.We made it back to the truck with no further incidents.We had all been raised in the woods and new the sound of most animals that normally would be encountered, but this was something very different It was about 7:00 7:30 in the evening the sun was starting to set, not dark but getting there 8 feet tall and was about the color of a deer I truly believe with all my heart that what I saw that day was a real Bigfoot It had long hair and it was not really moving He said he steped out onto his porch(which  wraps around his house) to sit in his chair and have a smoke It then seem to stride over the back side of the ridge away from us I noticed it stood up on two legs He was only a few feet away from me At that point I froze and the hair stood up on my neck I NEVER THOUGHT TOO MUCH ABOUT IT UNTIL A SAW A SHOW ON BIG FOOT THAT MENTIONED SIGHTINGS IN THAT AREA. tall to see it through the dorway like I did I saw a large dark figure with eyes that seemed to illuminate red in the moonlight Then I said to her that I didn't want her to think I was crazy but it looked to me like it was walking on 2 legs...not 4"
Idaho,"I was afraid the bigfoot would hear me They stopped by the waterfalls to look around and came upon a large footprint on the timber trail The eyes seemed to be about level with my eyes as I sat on the horse  The first time I heard this sound other than my encounter was on your Finding Bigfoot TV show. It was one of those sounds that makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up We stayed too late and it had gotten dark, as we passed over this stream I saw something off to the side tall.the things hand was wrapped around a approx.6inch dia.tree and it's thumb and index finger were touching.it made no noise.he said it probably wasn't much of a plant eater due to his seeing a hint of teeth protuding from it's mouth.it changed my dad after he saw this thing.he has never been the same since.he used to be quite an outdoorsman.he quit hunting,dirt bike riding and camping immeadeatly after this incident happened.he does not talk about it at all.he said if things like that are out there he doesn't need to be out there. The 19"" TV was sitting on top of a tall wood storage box next to the wood stove directly across from the couch This is where the hair on the back of my neck started tingling, which prompted me, sitting in the middle, to turn around and look behind me  My overall impression was that they were incredibly tall and rather slender Generally they seemed bipedal and if I took a really long stride (I'm 5'11"") I could walk naturally in the tracks It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up tall, with really long arms that he/she swung like a cross-country skier as he walked., and taking rather long strides as well. He was no more than 10 feet from me  the truck was shut off then i heard and felt big hands grab the cab and sleeper bars and shook the truck about 2 times then 3 times just short gentle shakes then a semi truck started rocking side to side like it was a rag doll i jumped up and quickly looked out of the passengers side window just in time to see a dark reddish brown creature take 2 strides into the young douglas fir trees and it was gone, the only thing was i was parked about 20 to 30 feet from the tree line i was so shook up i drove to billings mt when we got turned around the lights from the vehicle couldn't hit it so I decided to step out with a flashlight when I shined the light on it,it stood up on it's hind legs about 30feet from me.It was standing in a borrow pit and it was at least a foot taller then me,Iam 6 foot tall.When I seen it I started yelling at it & it ducked down every time I would stop making noise it would start to raise its head again.When I backed up & got into the bronco it jumped up & ran after us,& chased us quite aways On November 4 2006,Me & my family were driveing through the foothills above Idaho Falls near willowcreek when my sister,fiance,daughter&nephew said they had seen something off to the side of the road I was a bit concerned about camping in the site after the campground was officially closed, but figured that as it was already getting dark, it was unlikely that we would be confronted by a ranger The scrub aspen hit the tallest bigfoot just below the shoulder I decided to write because a few months back I saw a show that had a man  that was recounting his Bigfoot sighting in Ca I tied the horses up at the mouth of this canyon and decided to hunt for a few hours before it got dark on the ridge on the north side of Bear Trap and south of Temple Peak  The hair on the back of my neck stood up as I looked down at the tracks  I even pointed it out to my 12 year old son, that that stump looked just like a Bigfoot I never have been a believer in the Bigfoot stories and legends but have since changed my attitude  As I rode along the trail, the forest canopy closed overhead and I was riding on something of a game trail through the cool, dark forest I showed my friends and we looked for more tracks but that's all the tracks we could find was the ones coming from the water out of the water and into the water by that time it was starting to get dark and we needed a start the hike back so we started the hike back If there are more stories of people actually trying to find Big Foot I would be most interested  And the way they were running with their arms long and stretched out, jumping over logs and such  She was maybe less than 5 feet tall, and heavy built with short legs I had never been in this area before, but my instructions were to make way through the forest and walk straight downhill.  After awhile, I was expected to breakout into a clearing where here will be a saddle with a few rocky knolls which would drain into some ponds at the bottom.  This entire area is known as the ""Bloody Bucket"", for what reason I wasn't sure and I didn't ask!  The hunt was planned out that my friends and I would slowly walk down through this are hoping to scare out a mule deer or a bull elk and having the big game cross the path of another hunter in our party.  We were spread out so far apart that we couldn't see or hear each other.  As I made my  way into the opening, everything was just as was described to me.  I could see where I needed to end up and meet even though it was a ways away.  I came out right in the middle of the opening and walked down to a rocky area, stopped to take a breather and looked around.  All of the sudden down to my left about 100 yards away I saw what appeared to be 3 erect dark brown beings walking down a trail near the trees as if they were in a hurry.  They were in order of height with the tallest leading the way, then a slightly smaller one followed by the smallest of the three which was trying hard to keep up with the other two.  As I took a deep breath to gather myself, to see if what I was experiencing was what I thought it was, the leader turned around and waved his/her arm in a manner as if to tell the smallest one to hurry up!  They continued to speedwalk into the timber and faded away.  I was very shocked, nervous and somewhat frightend  They told me they had seen a dark object moving in the shadows and were frightened that it could have been a black bear sow with cubs We also discovered the tree snap was actually a twin pine about 5 inches in diameter that was broken about six feet up from the ground My sons head was about a foot lower than mine while I sat on the horse  The stumps were 8 to 10 feet tall in the area, and our Sasquatch was real good keeping a stump between us so you could not get a good look at her I was waiting outside when I saw a dark figure just beyond the tree line As I sat there, I saw what I thought was one of our hunting party walk across the slope, about 100 feet below the ridgeline It was getting dark enough that the head lights on our ATV’s were illuminating the trail and passing trees but still enough light in the sky so you could look around and see hill sides and clearings We rode about another 50 yards and came across some huge footprints...they were not bear tracks....very human in form and very fresh And the south side where I found a breakaway portion of the overhanging bank and the only possible footprint just next to it on the south side of the breakaway, where I thought the animal climbed up on the bank out of the creek  I could fit my boot covered foot into them and they were definitely bigger than my boot The dog and I were about 8 feet from her My cousin tried but could not get much more than a hundred feet up and had to turn around These windows were approximately  7 feet from the ground on the outside If the south of the tree was where they were standing side-by-side, that would make them in the 7-8 foot height range  My friend said, ""What the hell is that??""   I joked, ""Bigfoot!""  He immediately said it is someone splitting wood I had seen on ""In Search Of"" that bigfoot tracks were about 18 inches long and looked exactly like big human prints, which wasn't to be the case with this track We both thought it sounded like it was bipedal and I thought it was a very large man outside of some caves and they played a taped recording of what they presume is Bigfoot In the midst of full stride turned and looked full into my face, then continued its course down the incline out of sight It was dark brown to black in color My girlfriend was sitting about four feet away and after shouting into the forest that I was armed and would shoot if threatened As I was mentally visualizing the small bigfoot or mutant grizzly that had made the print, the silence once again intruded on my consciousness It was the high forest and the trees were between 8 and maybe 40 feet high, with little underbrush  Before I could walk back to the tree which was only about 15 feet behind me, the branch had stopped moving As I came over the ridge, I found myself on a very steep, shale-covered slope about 500 feet above the stream At this point I have tears in my eyes and scared to death my husband was sick to his stomach almost to the point of being sick we were both so confused on what just happened we started driving and about 400 yards up the road on his side again he seen something move at the corner of his eye he looked quickly and these branches on these trees about 7 feet high were moving right in a row like something very tall had just ran through pushing them out of its way I've heard the expression of putting one's foot in his mouth but I really felt awful when I realized I'd just screwed up the only possible track that we found by putting my foot in it She said she couldn't see anything outsde from up there ,so I flew up the stairs using my hands and feet As I approached the scrub aspen I realized how tall the bigfoot was  Behind the brush was a small meadow and a dark timbered basin surrounded on three sides by steep rocky ridges I was walking down the dirt road when about 200 yards from the camp out from the right of the road a large 7 or 8 foot(Mabie Taller.)grey bigfoot came out about 10-15 feet in front of me  The heel portion of the right foot was quite visible but when I first noticed it I was facing the creek on top of the overhanging bank shows were jokes, but finding your site helps me realize I did see Bigfoot We caught only the briefest glimpse but the creature was easily 8 to 10 feet tall and covered in brown fur The night of my encounter, meeting Bigfoot was the last thing on my mind and I must say I was confused by what I saw as well as being left utterly speechless Grabbing a flashlight, I walked 75 feet or so back to our vehicle to get my 9mm pistol 95 About 10 miles north of Council well after dark I sat there on the horse staring at the two sets of eyes for about 1 full minute We came across what appears to be a large foot print my husband wears a size 12 and this print was a few inches bigger.""i have a photo"" The couch was positioned along an outside wall beneath a row of 3' wide x 5' tall picture windows Let me start by saying I'm a non believer in Bigfoot, but what my Uncle and I heard and smelled one camping night I can't explain Its strides were over double mine and Im 6ft  Then as suddenly as it started, my intense feeling of anxiety was totally gone  He kept telling me it looked him right in the eyes and scared him so bad he couldn't move or talk He had really long arms and was at least 8 feet tall, maybe more But my two lights didn't have enough candle power to see the outline of bodies with the eyes I could see the reflection of the windows in the darkened TV screen The trail went through a dark canyon that seemed to have thicker vegetation then the main Eight Mile Canyon  It was much darker obviously, but very much human The footsteps got closer and closer and then the animal was in our site It was not like the dark black eyes you see on other forest animals So I was laying in bed at my cabin near Saint Marie’s Idaho in Benewah Creek Road up in the mountain and I heard what sounded like wood knocks get closer and closer and it was just my mom and I at the cabin and I didn’t hear foot steps but something that sounded like a hand hit the wall where I was sleeping and startled me to death and it could not be any other animal but a Sasquatch  The hair stood up on the back of my neck I was coming up to a curve in the road where to my left is the embankment down to the river about 40 feet, and a cliff to my right If indeed there was something or someone outside of the window staring at him then they would have to be at least 7 - 8 feet tall because the window is about that high off of the ground outside of the cabin  I heard footsteps very near my tent We set up camp that evening and was just getting ready to fall asleep when the most hair raising howl, scream, grawl I ever heard in the wild As it was getting dark, with a bit of adrenaline and heavy handed throttle I managed to climb my ATV over the smaller end of the tree I don’t think it was a large person; it was very dark and the animal obviously had no man made light.  Its arms swung from side to side like any human walking in stride  After only 20 minutes,my buddy tapped lightly on the window, and once cracked open said something big had walked completely around the car and was now positioned about 15 or 20 feet in front of the car He thouht that it was a little unusual that the 'bear' was walking very steady on it's hind legs more like a human The eyes were reflecting mostly bright white with a slight tinge of gold I was driving into a curve before Wiegand Private Road when approximately 40-50 ft in front of me I saw a very large, dark form walk straight across the highway, right to left I couldn't really tell what it was except that it walked on two legs and had dark fur.  Curiosity was out running common sense and fear at the moment so I pointed the spot light in the general direction of where the creature was last heard and turned it on, the creature whirled as the light hit it and began boulder hopping up through a steep rock slide, on two legs at incredible speed and agility As I lifted by foot out of the track it looked as if my boot heel was just about where the toe prints might have been if I hadn't stepped on it  We did not drive over to look for any footprints as the car was usable on roads only  It maybe took it two or three strides to accomplish that and it was fast I noticed it had dark skin on its face and yellowish eyes  The creature, which had previously been hunched over slightly, stood up on two legs and looked directly at me These steps were large, silent and punctuated with his long arms swinging with his strides Being 6’3” I would guess this being to be about 8 feet tall We found a lightly used trail that went into a dark canyon Again the water was hip or waist deep and again the animal crossed without changing his stride or pace and never shook off  A large hairy creature came up the embankment in front of my car, crossed the road and went up the embankment on the opposite side of the road I had camp all set up by noon, wo I decided to go for a horse ride and maybe hunt a little before dark It appears that nobody is really looking for ""Big Foot"" when one crosses their path It was covered in dark hair from the top of its head down  At the moment the lights came on we saw in front of us not much more that 15 feet away at the edge of the small clearing a bigfoot at about 6 feet tall, dense black fur and completely standing upright with arms to the side The bigfoot looked just as surprised to see me as I was to see him She agreed that they could, in fact, be Bigfoot prints. I thought it could be a moose, but I have watched them walk before and I don’t think the sound would be bipedal I looked at my friend and said, ""Did you see that?  ""What did we just see?""    We pondered for a minute,  and then I said, ""Maybe we just saw bigfoots .. Then it hit me what I was really seeing (BIGFOOT) The tree was about 12 to 14 feet tall and bent tip to ground before springing back up I was playing with my dogs about 200 feet from the campfire right before sunset I sat on the horse for a couple more minutes looking for any glint of eyes as they moved away from me but I never saw them again  She had long beautiful wavy hair and her hair on her head was long enough you could not see her ears I looked very closely for foot prints but could not find any clear prints in the hard gravelly ground That hill was taller than the one I was on As far as estimating height, my dad is 6ft tall, and this thing was much taller and broader...but not fat...kinda “lanky” I retreated back away from the woods and after a few minutes sat in my chair with my flashlight and pistol in my lap I don’t think it was a bear, unless it was a very large one (there are no grizzlies in that area), and I thought that the stride length was much longer than a bear’s But it was definitely standing erect, slight forward slump and very agile on two feet, not like a waddling bear standing on its rear feet The creature was very tall, even at this greater distance That day I recorded the tracks and took pictures with my foot next to its foot but I of course lost the phone snowboarding in Bend the winter after No other animal would go down such a steep and brushy incline on its back legs or with such ease Myself and five members of my family witnessed a strange event while we were out rabbit hunting after dark on a warm and clear night in the spring of 1963  The peak was more of a tall hill covered with tall grass and I continued up to the top Chasing after it with flashlights was never mentioned or considered as we would not have felt comfortable approaching it with a minimal light source in the dark I remember thinking, “boy, he is going to get shot, dressed in dark clothing like that!” It kind of made me mad because he was walking a rather brisk pace, not even stopping to look around for game Brandon then told me he saw a large hairy thing, hunched over, very tall, bigger than a bear and had peircing yellow eyes The face looked like a gorilla but with longer hair and ""smarter eyes"" Years later, a friend of my moms, who knew about my sighting, gave her an old local newspaper with a story in it about multiple bigfoot sightings occuring with in a 30 mile radius of home during that 1979 time period.  I saw what looked like a very large Bigfoot standing at the top of the ridge near a tree I arrived back at the horses just as it was getting dark As we took off on foot back toward camp we had formed a line, my step mother in front, then my brother, followed by me, and my dad was taking up the rear I wear size 12 shoe and my foot next to its foot made mine look small Seemed to be at a stand still but was in a stride position, as if when I saw him he had been walking paralell to us but I only looked long enough to see him in between steps I cant find it anywhere.we continue driving no luck at all don't even see a deer we decide to turn around and go back in this same exact spot which is now on my husband's side he slams on the brakes and says what the hell is that give me the gun, I hand the gun and lean over him to see what he's looking at its a tall black figure with a head no ears very wide shoulders and couldn't see the bottom part there was a tree in the way he stares back and takes a step to the left behind a tree all this happened within 40 seconds or so he vanishes again Immediately there was a call in reply that sounded agitated,  They proceeded to call back and forth, progressively getting closer to my location, and it was getting dark  Although I had grown up in Northern California and was familiar with Bigfoot lore, I had pretty much filed it away as a neat story but not something to believe in  I remember that it was dark colored and hairy with long arms that swung sort of in an exaggerated way One evening we decided to go up the canyon to the southwest and explore a bit before dark They took some pictures with their phones and with my daughter's friends foot next to it I was at the front walking up on the bend point, it was thick with willows up until 15 feet from the flowing rivers water I always wondered what Bigfoot thought about sixteen people coming down the trail at this time of night, costumes and all After 2-3 more instances, with my 3 dogs cowering at my feet, I decided to respond ""There is a bigfoot outside."" I whispered  I told myself that it was probably just a large stump that looked like a silhouette of Bigfoot on the ridge There standing side-by-side at approximately 25-30 yards were two sets of eyes Then the one on my right slowly turned to it's left and verified to me that it was the eyes of a predator We are positive 100% positive this wasn't a bear or person we're convinced what we seen last night was,  had to of been bigfoot. I estimated the being to be about 8 feet tall judging from the height judging from my height on the ATV at the time in relation to its arm height The other thing that very much bothered me was that I never took my eyes off of what happened but somewhere between the figure walking across the highway and walking off the side, it disappeared We realized that it was slowly starting to get darker so we decided to head back to camp He said that it was very dark in color and was very tall and hairy,  After it had stared at him for a time, it proceeded in walking towards where he was standing There was deep snow on the ground and it was cold, dark, and snowy on that day This call made us nervous as we both felt it was made by a person who was creeping around our campsite in the dark messing with us From a promontory, large dark colored, sitting, sometimes turning Sasquatch was observed Masses of sticks were then woven into the frame to produce a hollow area approximately 6 feet by 12 feet The figure was tall like an adult, slightly hunched over but not hunchbacked, the arms were not a whole lot longer than would be considered normal Their arms were long  At the time it looked 20 feet tall (I was only 7) but in reality was probably 7 or 8 feet tall and it didn't take it long to cross the road and down the side of the mountain I just stood there looking back at it, when suddenly it broke out into a stride along the length of the tree line and it silently disappeared into the night I never saw clearly what was lurking in the darkness but I'm sure that it was Bigfoot.  There were no other tracks that a human would make such as footprints, snowmobile, or snowshoe going up this ravine After a couple of seconds it sensed my movement and looked directly into my eyes It seemed about four feet tall and I thought I don’t remember seeing it there on our way in a couple hours ago The next day, my sons ( ages 13 and 9 ) asked me if they could go up a tall hill and come back down I was hunting for deer when I came across foot prints with toe impressions  Eventually, I reached the foothills on this warm and dry Idaho summer day I was looking to my right and the mountain was steep but about ten to fifteen feet up on the side of us the mountain leveled out alomst like a narrow path in a ring around the mountain then continued on a steep angle as far as the trees would allow me to see Lets go take a look.""  My friend said,   ""No way,  I'm not going down there if those were bigfoots."" We talked about what we saw I had the distinct impression that it wasn’t an owl, but a person whooing for someone in the dark woods, like someone trying to contact a hiker who was late getting back to the car (though there were no other cars in the area) I estimate the height of one at approximately 8 foot and the other 7-1/2 foot We turned and saw the silhouette of a very large bi-ped observing us from only about ten feet away They swung their arms in fairly long arcs as they walked; much like a human power walker Its kinda creepy the unnatural sounds I've heard all over the mountains and woods across Eastern Idaho but never thought about bigfoot cause I had never found any FOR SURE tracks  I say usually because it was totally covered in deep snow They said it looked like the back leg was missing and saw another bone a few feet from it By this time, it was dark and we couldn’t see anything beneath the tree canopy outside of our campsite I always hunt until dark and walk out at night away a tall, black, muscular, hairy, creature was standing behind a small tree with it's hand wrapped around it staring straight at my dad.he said it's domed head took up a good quarter of the scope.he said the things gaze was inhuman and he started to shake uncontrolably.he looked at it for a good minute and a half ,the thing stood there like a statue the entire time he was looking at it.he then dropped the thing from view and then pulled back on it and it was gone.he didn't want to alarm my mom who had no idea what had just happened so he told her they better be going and off they went,back to the truck and then home.my dad said he didn't like the things eyes.he finally told me this story a few years ago.he said it was highly intelligent looking,no neck.head set low between the massive shoulders,domed head,long coal black hair;shorter on the face area,he could see it's massive chest rise and fall with every breath it took,my dad estimated it at about 10ft  It had gotten quite dark and we had a lantern hung in a tree over our cook table and Coleman stove I told him that I thought I had seen him, but saw no rifle and almost shot at him as he was dressed in dark clothing One of the sets of eyes was higher up than the other  He looked like a 10 year old boy with hair all over it So to sum it up: the tracks were roughly human foot shaped but very large-too large to be human That 15 feet was just pure sand all at the tip of this bend  For some reason, my eyes immediately traced the distance from the former location of the shadow to where I had rode out of the treeline As they turned and walked into the timber I saw very long arms, almost to the knees The hair on my arms and neck stands on end now writing this nearly 12 years later He felt sudden fear race through him as he felt it's eyes lock onto him  Well he said that someone reported a bigfoot sighting around there about 3 years ago, and they saw the tracks Looking down in the middle of the creek where the screaming was coming from there were the eyes of a predator {eyes coming out of the front of the head} It was covered in an orangish, redish, brown hair from head to toe I imagine one could make up a Bigfoot story if they wanted to, but I doubt one could make up the scenario that led to my encounter Oct 20 6:15 PM Observed 2 big foots walking up the trail that I was hunting on I was approx 6 foot tall at the time and the aspen was over my head  The perspective effects of looking through tree trunks made it difficult to say exactly, but visibility was maybe 100 feet  It was dark and cool and there was no movement or noise 30 feet in front of me  I am not sure if this is at all related to Bigfoot activities  I remember thinking that the sasquatch was not as hairy as I would have thought and that it was not as tall as I had ever imagined  I came around a bend and saw a huge dark figure on two legs, upright bounding right up the mountain side to my right  My first thoughts were that it was a moose because the impacts of its feet/hooves were those of a heavy animal Its not a place you want to be bare foot. It appeared very tall and covered with dark brown hair I remember the walking motion of the legs and the slight swinging motion of the arms I must have blinked my eyes at just the right time, because all of a sudden the eyes disappeared and I didn't see which direction it went I had my six foot son stand in two different clearing places they could have been standing on the far bank  As I reached the treeline, I could only see a few feet into the dark forest  It was an enormous animal track and my first thought was that it was a bigfoot print He said,"" yeah...it was huge, hairy and fast!"" It [the sasquatch] was about 17 to 20 feet from the top and in two or three strides it made it to the top It was approx 19in long and it looked just like ""a huge human footprint huge"" I was sitting in a lawnchair in front of the house I asked my Uncle if he heard that and his eyes were wide open with a quick ""yes"" That's when all the hair on my arms and neck stood straight on end  Without mentioning the word bigfoot or sasquatch, I looked at him and said ""Is this what I think it is?"" and he non-chalantly replied something to the effect of ""We see this kind of stuff around here all the time"" After they left – the witnesses went to the place and observed crushed dry grass, very large stride traces of foot prints in the dry terrain and were surprise by the remarkable scale of vegetation versus the clear views of these bipeds  As I turned and admired view, I started to get that ""you're being watched"" vibe and my eyes were suddenly drawn down to the dark treeline The two legged creature peeked out from behind the tree and then ran 10 feet over to the next cottonwood tree and hid behind it The right hand was similar to a humans with fingers and a thumb, all dark in color On September 22nd we decided to go bear hunting on the other side of the mountain, we also had a key for that gate we drove in 11 miles and to the left of me there's and old clear cut but saplings growing and must be at least 10/15 feet tall I see something black and standing tall and moving through these trees I realized that I saw someone, very distinctly bipedal, walk across the highway The bigfoot spun rapidly on it heels and dashed into the cover of the woods.  In front of us across the road ran a huge hairy animal We both know what we saw...big foot. I could see the moonlight reflecting off his green eyes and for the whole minute or two that we stood frozen staring at each other he didn't blink once Dad was probably 50 feet or so lower in elevation than I was To my left BF caught my eye as it started to slide down the embankment, on its feet I think he could still see something out there in the dark that I couldn't see To this day, I really do not know what that was on the skyline, and I am not convinced that it was in fact a Bigfoot (I am a beliver), but it was something that I can not explain.  I should note that I never heard this sound being emitted by the animal, all I heard was the impacts of its feet I will never forget what I saw! There, just a few feet away was a sasquatch peering in the window But we had heard no vehicles drive in, saw no headlights or flashlights, and it was too dark and overcast for a person to drive or walk around the woods without a light It was an intense stare down as I was not even 15 feet away from it and I could see it's hair on its back intensely sticking up as I started to move me and my friends around her What I saw was a quiet tall long haired bipedal mamal with the hair from head to toe, complete four steps to get accross the road"
Illinois,"as i walked back to my chair and told them to keep there lights off And each one of its leaps, bings, jumps, whatever it was 15 to 20 feet at a time and it was gone  I can't say that it was a big foot but I have no other explanation for it What Mary and her husband saw: It was Thursday morning February 3, 2011, the blizzard had finally stopped dumping some 3 to 4 feet of snow with drifts much higher The closest thing I have heard is similar to a peacock but sound bites of Bigfoot screams are pretty much dead on It was too far away to get any more specific on the coloring but this one was much more heavier and hairier This particular sink hole was approximately six feet deep in the center tapering up to about 2 feet along the edges i asked was it about 4-5 feet tall he said yes I could see the hair moving on its body but its head did not move  I would have to estimate it was 7 feet or more tall It was tall enough I could see its whole body  On this night my wife and I were going to sit on the front porch with my Grandmother and sister when we started to hear a sound that raised the hair on the back of my neck and as I type this out I get that feeling all over again Now it was a very dark night, it was really hard to see even a silhouette of the trees with the skyline, let alone anything else out there plus we had the fire going so it was even harder to see even if you had one eye closed you know I was on the side of the road facing north in my rear view mirror I seen a tall black figure walk behind my vehicle it crossed the road in 3 strides This thing had long black hair and very shaggy I found only torn twisted horseweed and snapped branches about five and a half feet up I believe it was a baby Bigfoot as I have heard rumor and stories of this public land from countless people and friends of being chased up trees, rocks thrown at them, and their stands being ripped to shreds. In summary: • The animal was 7 feet tall But on that episode of Monster Quest the “in search of Bigfoot” crew were being told by the landowner (an area on the Texas-Louisiana borders) that there have been many sightings on his property ( The trees stood exposed out of the sink hole at a minimum of 12 to 14 feet in height.) The barn sat to the right of the house about 300 yards away and the horses were standing nearby The dogs barked and howled, but did not go any nearer than 500 feet to animal When it hit the road I could see very large legs spread wide in a dead run with large swinging hairy arms His hair was all over his body but his face was a bit different than some of these on tv Right about 30 feet before the bend in the road I parked my car there and I was showing John where I saw the animal the first time  It was a very bright moonlit night and I could tell that it was dark brown or black in color I looked down and saw a footprint in the ice I went to my sister's house approximately 1/4 mile up the road and got her camera and we went back and took pictures of the footprints in the snow I have good eyes and looking for deer, when I noticed this big human like figure Shortly after this I spotted a footprint, classic human shape with five toes, in some dried mud He was more black like leather around his eyes and mouth i called i little foot though because it didnt look that t tall only 4 -5 feet I was walking up a field road that passed thru a patch of woods that led to a larger feild on top of a hill a few hundred feet away Going west on Lorenzo Rd 1 or 2 miles west of I-55 a big foot walked out in front of our car I walked maybe less than ten feet and I heard a few more grunt noises toward me and they seemed like they weren't that far off, I had that feeling that someone was watching me and as I stood there I heard it went from a grunt to, oh I would say, a loud more of a scream or yell It stood there and looked at me and was approximately 5 feet in height on all four feet It was very tall, body was huge and the eyes just stared at me. John - I felt fortunate that way, the only thing I can remember in detail to this day, close my eyes and remember The light was just wrong but it looked like it was hairy and had long arms. The animal seemed to be a dark gray with little or no hair, we could not tell for sure though grandma found them big footprints It starts out as a high pitched siren type scream that makes every hair on your body stand up My hair stood up, I thought “What in the world is walking in twigs and branches?” And I said “Who’s there?” and I stopped, and I’m thinking “a couple of my friends know and are they pulling a prank?” And then I think I said it again “Who’s there?” like that We also noticed that approximately 75 feet or so and to the North of the footprints a fairly good sized tree of maybe 3 to 4 inches in circumference had been snapped and bent over I was almost home and I live on West Lake Drive then all the sudden I just see this two legged being about 7 to 8 ft tall just bolts in front of me into the woods just across from my house When it ran it didn't pump its arms   I got the feeling again of being watched and remember carefully looking around out of the corner of my eyes, to see any movement in the weeds or trees I was out here with a friend where we had a log, six inch thick by six foot long physically fly out of the trees and land within about three feet of us She said, ""Did you see that?"" And I said half jokingly, ""what Bigfoot?"" She said, ""you seen it too?"" I told her I thought it was a tree that was cut off at the top Very bulky looking, It had redish brown hair and glanced at me for just a moment I also could make out impressions in the dirt on the trail going in, that looked to have been made by a foot of about the same size Where ours has an arch this looks like the footprint is curved  I could make out the outline and see that it's groin had cleared the washer and that it was covered in hair  In shock I turned to look at my cousin, his eyes were as big as mine and we found ourselves asking, ""What the hell was that""?  He agreed It wasn't human. I found no fur/hair on any branch or the dog run fencing It seemed to move effortlessly cross the road, in only a few strides I walked a short distance, I notice a path through the tall grasses It was nearly dark by this time and the sound came again but this time it was a very, very loud screech, almost a scream so close I instinctively held my ears My sister and I looked at each other for a second and “Bigfoot” was gone – disappeared instantly It landed on its hind legs, took 3 or 4 steps, then went to all fours and ran faster than I have ever seen anything run into the treeline I seen something tall and black, about 7 feet tall,  run real fast across 12th Street in Lawrenceville about 3 weeks ago. The last walk we went on was kind of late, from 6 till about 7 pm after dark Most have the creature being the size of a big boned man around 6 foot 4 all was quiet and dark and sure did smell bad Its eyes were kind of darting back and forth, that is how I got to see some white and then I turned around and ran, I was scared, I was really scared It would make sense to me that the Bigfoot would move to a different location because all the water in the area dried up Since then I am a believer and I know that bigfoots exist In the same proximity we discovered two other footprints which were approximately the same size This is the second time that I have seen Bigfoot in my lifetime It wasn't until a few years ago that I heard a sasquatch vocal on a website, and my hair stood up because the vocalization sounded exactly like what I had heard that night. 54.....we were on the water an hour or so.....we were fishing north east of the boat ramp.....in a small inlet....we had been fishing in this area for approximatly 10 minutes or so.....and we all heard a rucuss on the bank behind some brush....we both saw a large long reddish brown haired creature running on two feet at a fast pace....it appeared to be taller than 6 feet....it reminded me of an orangutan...except taller.....my wife said...what the ### is that......I said I dont know but keep us away from the shore and lets stay on the water....she said you know I don't believe in big foot,,,,but what was that....I said I don't know...it's not a deer,,,,the hair was redder and long.......maybe a bear...I don't know......  As I stood there, fixed, it suddenly stopped and turned a little sideways and looked straight up into my eyes...like it knew I was there And he was about eighty feet away, seventy to eighty feet and he closed half that distance in three steps before he veered off the hill at a forty-five degree angle, ran down the ridge which is about an eight per cent grade for about maybe about 150 feet and then hits the valley of the two ridges and went up the next ridge which is about as steep and tall   He would not have made it fifty feet Had burnt orange hair, stood 6 ft tall, had massive legs and eyes the size of silver dollars  As I started going down the hill I noticed eyes off to the side of the road My wife and I went Franklin Creek area for hiking and we found a bigfoot track by the creek It looked to be around 4 n a half to 5 feet tall The area surrounding the cemetery is rural, the cemetery itself has a fence around the rear part of the graveyard however the best that we could tell in the darkness is that it looked like there was an open field to the rear of the cemetery and it appeared that on the other side of the open field there may be more substantial tree coverage Stan - How tall was it? Jim - I would have to say eight foot range  It was broad built, what I could see, and the arms were long The one I saw was as shiney black as could be, looked very clean and neat as if his hair had been combed He wanted to see what kind of eyes it had I don't really spook that easy but when the hair stands up, something is watching you You could see the heel and the ball of the foot as well as toe imprints  I know most reports I have seen do not describe ""bigfoot"" with ""glowing animal eyes"" but this did and they were very bright Tom – Anyway when I came in from that I went to check email and Facebook was up with the link for Chatham for the story they just published in the paper about footprints and Messing With Sasquatch I have pictures of a foot print and a hand print that I took in the forest preserve that is on the east side of my town The squatch was 3 and a half to 4 tall The second encounter I got a series of pics that aren't the best but show a dark figure walking away Creek flooded and the footprint gone. I remember the swinging of the arms out in front of itself like it was pushing it's way through the corn and it was still daylight but it was getting dark at this time due to daylight savings time ending this past weekend. It didn't run until I got about 20 feet in, that's when its pace picked up I remember joking about it being Bigfoot trying to warn us away from his area then hearing more strange noises and another giant splash After never hearing any news story about a missing Polar Bear I put in the back of my mind always suspicioning that it may have been a Bigfoot When I saw it I hit my bright lights, it had two legs and it was hunched over like it had long arms draggin right above the road It made a gesture [raising of arms] that was all I saw After we showed the neighbor the footprint, he told us that his dog darted out in the backyard one night then immediately came running back and cowered near his owner for the remainder of the night It was long haired, light colored, and just standing in the field I would have guestimated it was about seven feet tall, maybe taller, and we locked eyes for just a matter of a few seconds, then it rounded the tree that it was standing next to and took off down the slope of a gulley and I took off up the path running like crazy  What makes a print like the one we’ve found on our property?  There’s two plausible possibilities; (1) A very large, very heavy man or woman – with a 14+ inch foot - is walking around out in the cool spring air with no shoes, trespassing on private property, out in a rural part of the country, risking arrest or a bullet I just kept saying 'who would walk barefoot out here it's way too cold?' If it were a large animal it had to have its arms wrapped around the tree and shaking it, that is what I imagined   Later one friend helped me measure my stride at a dead run and my height and I was able to use algebra to determine that the creature must have been between 7-9' tall I said “There is something back there, but I’m not going to go look after dark not when it’s something powerful On Sunday, October 23, 2011, the witness had an unusual experience at his home and the next morning found a large footprint outside his living room window six to seven feet tall It didn't seem to be extremely tall, but what caught my eye was the huge muscles on its legs and arms I said to myself out loud ""f***ng Bigfoot!"" It was a about 2 seconds before it vanished in the darkness altogether but I could see it clearly Stan - What about footsteps? Have you ever heard footsteps? Mark - Oh yeah, you hear those out here a lot, but there are deer out here and everything, but sometimes when you walk down the path, that path is quite aways through the middle of the woods to get out here, and you're being followed sometimes Out in plain sight, plain as day there was an actual fur bodied, walking, probably 10 to 20 feet away from the silhouette I saw a smaller one and this one was starting to walk where the trees thin out it started to make its way to where the trees get thicker, and just walking It was bending down standing on the back legs, it picked something up out of the road with great care, looked right up at us and then took off so fast in the woods on its two back legs standing up caring for whatever it was that it picked up  I had a very fleeting glimpse of red reflected eyes, meaning man or predator It was a human shape but the shape from the head to the body was flowing with long hair all over Stan - How tall do you think it was? Mark - Eight feet to nine feet.tall  Can't imagine anyone wandering around a construction site barefooted and in cold mud. I couldn't get further back off the bean field as it was heavily covered in 6' tall sycamore trees that I could not maneuver through even during the day In my opinion I think this was the tracks of a big foot. I found a footprint with a broad heal and wide ball, deeply impressed into muddy soil  I know what I seen and I saw a large hairy thing running across that field I guess there might have been lighter and darker colors on its face but it was all hairy This would have to be a totally insane person to be approaching two people armed in the middle of the woods at dark, you know, so we knew it wasn't a person It was still dark out and I had my lights on, the creature was just at the end of where my lights hit These tall grasses were in front of the area I had come out of We rode as fast as we could about a half mile home and he said it was a strange hairy man chasing us As I approached a turn in the treeline, I immediately saw something walking toward me, at a distance of about 45-50 feet We happened to notice a large complete footprint under an apple tree in our backyard measuring about 18"" It had very long strides, (arms the hanged down low) and stopped when it saw me, looked at me and continued walking I'm an avid duck hunter, and a die hard cat fisherman, so I'm used to traipsing around in the dark I am six foot tall The foot falls where very loud like whatever it was had some weight on it  His face didn't have much hair and his lips looked thin and wide  We checked the next morning and found very large footprints right outside of the tent I heard a noise about 40 yards from me in the thicket I figured it was a buck chasing a doe,,, A minute later a large gorilla looking creature appeared walking south to north at about 7am he was about 7 feet tall and was dark brown The fence was near a ditch and the fence was still about 4 feet high  He kept looking in the side rear view mirror, and it was totally dark behind us, so I told him that he wasn’t going to see anything back there She says it was black/brownish, upright & extremely large and tall! She says she still doesn't believe bigfoot exists. All this melt caused the crushed gravel path to act like a white clay, making all the hikers/dogs/coyotes footprints visible in a 30 foot area A Golden Retriever has that color hair, make that a little darker and with a little bit more copper-tone, more red-head feel to it Good for a bigfoot Old timers told us to be careful of the “Grassman” which I later learned was their name for Big Foot Mostly it was a dirty brownish color and always the hair was matted with mud and plant material no matter the color They simply don't stand on two legs  We know that some of our people belive bigfoot to be a spiritual being not a physical being It had very thick, heavily muscled legs As i got closer It looked furry and i thought why would someone be wearing a coat it's 65 degrees or more out! As i jogged closer, the thing got bigger (it had it's back toward me) and I stopped, got the chivvers and thought...that is a bigfoot...then the thing went around the bend ahead where there's a small stream and retention pond He never said he thought it was a Bigfoot but I was still curious so I went out there to look around and see what he was talking about It was black and hairy and it climbs trees I saw and heard the same big foot everybody else describes moving very fast and easily on the side of the steep embankment below the effigy toward the river My friend asked me; ""Dude was that Bigfoot?!"" at the same second I yelled ""That was Bigfoot!."" Funny I have read countless books on the subject from the time I was in grade school, and let me tell you.. It did stand on two legs  I squinted my eyes and rubbed them in case my eyes weren't seeing correctly He described them to me as being 7 to 8 feet tall with glowing eyes and only moved at night for the most part It had bulging eyes and a pushed in nose We were on our bikes down by the creek and we heard something and we looked up, there was a small hill about sixteen feet high or so that used to go out and climb with our bikes I couldn't see the face very well because it was covered with hair With sunrise and another dose of courage and more friends and weapons the hunters returned to the barn to find nothing but foot prints that followed them to the edge of the road where their truck had been the night before And I stopped and saw this big black hairy thing I have never actually seen anything except once  a large dark shape moving bipedally through the heavy fog It had a long stride, stood upright, was covered with dark brownish to like black straight hair about 6 to maybe 10 inches long in some spots Unfortunately, it was too dark to visualize any specific features, but the silhouette seemed to be approximately 7-8 feet tall Unfortunately I did not see them with my own eyes, I just heard them After reading other stories I feel bigfoot was behind all the weird stuff that went on It was upright and appeared to be a dark blonde color in my headlights and very fast. It was like if you are running through the woods and you are nine feet tall and you are about ten feet into the woods before the outside of the woods stopped, that's how far into the woods it was The first one I got a very clear view of, I was 8 to 9 feet tall with very wide shoulders about twice as wide as mine, it had dark brown hair mixed with some grey, and it smelled awful  This went on in total darkness for an hour Showing this photo, he pointed out two silhouettes behind the brush in the background, one much taller than the other I guess it had to be at least 7 feet tall  The Unknown:  Was it a hippy, hillbilly or prankster who simply liked to walk barefooted around woods that had old rusty barbed wire among other occasional rusty or sharp artifacts? Or was it a Bigfoot? This remains the unknown. I also seen large foot-prints in certain areas but never told anyone This dark colored, large hairy animal on all 4 legs that resembled a bear His hair neatly laid around his face I found some footprints where it had stood on the side of the creek and that was maybe 30 yards from me Stan:  So, you saw it in the firelight? John:  Yes, and I got to see it there and I could tell that it was quite a bit taller than me, it had to be two foot taller than me and quite a bit wider. I got up and heard foot steps about 20 yards away so I immediatly packed up and left  Fact: The grass had the appearance of being freshly matted  Fact: There was what looked to be a human footprint completely intact and showed the entire outline of a foot with five toes Forty seven years have passed and to this day I think we had a bigfoot. he smelled bad and eyes were red and dark and he was hairy The trooper seemed to lose interest when my friend said that whatever he saw was about 7' tall I saw a bigfoot in the summer of 1979 just east of Seneca And I’ve got vertical blinds and they’re turned to block the light where I am sitting but when you are outside you can look and see the TV if you are tall I came over a hill at the creek and saw a black hairy figure about 8 feet tall walking around a round hut built with sticks and branches in the middle of a blackberry patch The sound of something BIG walking in the woods, on 2 legs No feet were there I jokingly said to my mom who was trying to see what i was watching ""its a bigfoot"" not really believing that I got a  good enough look to concur it was anything  I also heard no foot-falls as it ran, but I realize that I may have been too shocked to notice sounds We were going really slow because of deer at night, so while me and the boy we conversing on and off there from my side of the road comes a maybe 7 foot creature with the most beautiful chestnut long hair that covered all of its body just jogging across the front of my car crossing over the headlights Bulky, but covered in long-ish hair, so you couldn't make out much beyond that I didn't see its feet at all This thing was 5 feet wide at the shoulders   As I looked over Tom’s shoulder into the trees directly behind the Jeep, a large, tall, (figure of a man standing is about as high as the Jeep top when a normal suspended Jeep, and this was a foot or more taller) seemingly dark matted brown colored species of something bipedal ducked slowly behind a tree Way back in 1975 I was outside at my grandparents farm just outside Pinckneyville (Perry County) located next to a state park when I heard the most hair raising sound ever My wife actually saw a bigfoot one evening getting close to dark The foot prints came from the lake across the path and in to the woods At that instant I turned and walked back through those tall grasses trying to look over them and telling myself don't run, don't run, if you don't want to be chased, it's okay it's not going to hurt you No, first I saw the footprint It was brown, slender, about 6 feet tall the hair was about 2 inches long There we spotted one good footprint indented into the ground It had two toes its was big! Looking back now I would say it was 16 to 18 inches long  It was standing straight with arms down by its side I could even see its fingers The first one I found was the right foot and the big toe you could see it very clear, and the other one was four feet away and it was the left foot I saw it's eyes blink I could not see eyes or mouth but saw its head turn towards me before it jumped into the dark field. Eyes looked orange in the light I heard something going through the brush and observed a solid black 8 foot tall animal walking across a small clearing It was really tall and was on two feet i went up stairs in my son's bathroom to look out the window and he must of saw me and didn't like me watching him because he threw something at the house, so I stopped watching him.He was a darker color, I would say almost black but a little lighter I had worn my friends waders on occasion, and when standing in water the pressure would build on my feet and the pain would become unbearable A thin black 7 to 8 foot man like creature  She heard footsteps It was dark brown in color, standing aprox I thought, holy mackerel he is awefully tall.  There are lots of deer in the area, perhaps some coyote, but we could not think of what or who in their right mind would walk in 3 or 4 foot deep snow, not make any drag marks in the middle of a blizzard?? Mary and her husband did not take any pictures, darn, their minds were just not into thinking about a tall 7-10 foot creature walking down their driveway (which had been plowed) stopping at the edge of the patio, then walking across their yard, head towards the outhouse and then continue on and most likely leaped over the fence and onto the Prairie Path It had brownish-red fur, its arms were longer than a human's could ever be I believe it was a Bigfoot that ran out about 10 feet in front of me and stopped for about 15 seconds, it let out a very loud scream right at me then turned around and ran straight through the pond  I came around the first curve and then there is around two hundred feet of straight road before the curve to the right Its arms hung down to it's side, and it had large thick legs well since grandpa was indian he says leave it alone never bother the hairy beast or shoot at him youll anger him, well one night i had to go outside i was about 10 maybe 12 at that time The way it looks to me is that a Bigfoot was in the area at the time of the fishing trips Its puffy balloon feet (as she described it), held up a stocky, not so tall frame (6 ft.) He didn't think much of it at the time but he did think it was rather unusual that someone would be walking around barefoot in the middle of the mine spoils in December  It appeared to be a animal with black fur not very tall only 5 foot Out from behind a small hill into a clearing out walks a large White Creature that was very tall and very large It went from being on all fours to two legs as it was crossing the road My brother's wife said a very large hairy thing walked out of a ditch and across in front of her car one Sunday afternoon.This took place on Illinois Rt We went back down looking for any sign of the thing within 15 minutes, but we never found even so much as a footprint This and the fact that it was only about 40 feet away is why I could see it clearly He chuckled made a bigfoot reference and drove off when we got back he and my gf both said they heard footsteps behind them with brush moving on my grandparents land..who are now deceased..from the earliest i remember 1980 to 1999..it first started with my younger cousin tony about age 5 then, came running in the door out there on the farm, screamn about a hairy monster eatn a rabbit..grandparents raised rabbits and from time to time would find cages smashed and lil furrys ripped apart While driving my work van just as I was coming over the top of the hill (over pass) a tall dark figure passed in the tree line i asked was it covered in hair he said yes It was dark and in the headlights we both saw it run from the left side of the road to the right side of the road in front of the car It was a “feet don’t fail me now” moment  It was also tall as it stood above the top of my car Along with these prints are bare footprints about 13 "" long We were standing on top of a tall hill that we Called Highest peak  As we walked the road back we could hear something about 20-30 feet behind and off to the side of us moving through the brush and undergrowth  What I believe happened is that a Bigfoot saw us up the hill and made a call which was the moaning sound we all heard  They were closer together than deer eyes A single foot print it was the left foot and was very large   I stared at them and they stared back and I said “guys… guys… I see eyes are you seeing this?”  My friends ran back to me, I never took my eyes off of the eyes, my marine friend made it to me first and the eyes were still just staring at me I turned around and about I would say twenty feet, maybe a little further, standing downslope, we were eye to eye, was what I thought initially was a very large man in a fur get-up, with a stocking cap on because the head came to a point I didn't talk to anyone about it for years, but now that the monsters, finding bigfoot shows are on, my husband now believes they really exist I didn't notice the waist, I didn't notice the feet It was on all fours, long haired, bigger than a dog but smaller than a buck -deer The hair stood up on my head Which is to say that the creature’s arms were elongated...and it did not drop to all fours to run, it remained upright  It was just getting true dark outside  She said it sounded like one of your Bigfoot recordings I live in gran detour illinois , I searched some sites and in the 70's there were casting of footprints made in the area...contact me with any questions Right footprint found the 24th of October 2011 showing a width of 7 inches. The print was a good one very detailed you could see the toes and everything.I wear a size 13 and this print was way bigger than my foot • The animal was very hairy and beefy in appearance After these stories I have become a major bigfoot enthusiast  I was standing in the dark at our second story window looking (south) out at the back yard, partly because I am an insomniac, but this time because our 3 Beagles at the bottom of the hill were all barking in a way I'd never heard I froze in my tracks and looked toward the sound in time to see whatever it was jump from about 6 or 8 feet up in a tree to the ground We went back during the daytime, this thing was standing in this ditch which is about three feet deep It had honey blonde hair and beautiful amber colored eyes Stan - Did you notice a browline? John - The browline, it had a heavy brow, but no hair on the face I slowed for a bit, trying to see what it was, but it was too dark to see what it was or where had it gone.  He took several photos, including a  “foot-in” and “foot-out” to show scale, two with a tape measure, one showing depth, and photos of the area via Google earth. After dark he remembered that he didn't take the battery off the charger on the bass boat so he headed down the hill toward the dock But it's always difficult for photographs of footprints to show very much detail About 20 yards away I'm looking at something that's probably seven feet tall, not overly muscular but it was covered in  black hair And the footprint is curved, it almost looks like a broken foot or something, I don’t know how to describe it, but it’s not straight like ours I have not seen it since but it stood easily six feet stooped,  smelled like a rotting carcass even in the winter and walked on two then four legs What seemed like minutes probably only 30 seconds what came out of the timber that was walking upright and dark brown all over and somewhere between 6 1/2 to 7 feet tall at the edge of one timber crossing to another , probably a distance of about 20 yards between the two timbers , this thing whatever it was did not seem concerned that I was there The prints were approximately 12 to 13 inches what puzzled us was what was someone doing out at six thirty in the morning in early spring with an outside  temp around 35 degrees because we had very heavy clothes on because of the cold and the prints led straight up a four foot embankment and into some very heavy thorn brush the kind that a you can't even walk threw  with out ripping your cloths to shreds  I thought it could have been a person, but it ran across the street really fast, like someone with those fancy prosthetic legs It looked about 8 feet tall, black, hairy There was hair on the chin, kind of like the Patterson-Gimlin creature John was the first one to spot the silhouette and he asked me to come over, I guess my eyesight is a little better, and he said ""Hey, what does that look like to you?"" And then that was the time when we both saw its arm move and so I get on the hood of the car and I tried to get a better look 'cause I was going to see if it was either a shadow or three dimensional all the sudden we look down where these two revines meet and there is big (little) foot  Well, Mary's eyes got real big and she said ""Oh my gosh, so thats what those track were"" I went to peer around it and I couldn't believe my eyes, it's like nothing I have ever seen before What I saw was something large and hairy with a huge stride in its steps I believe that I observed the backside of this figure as it was walking into the treeline since I could not see eyes in my headlights Stan :  Was there moon that night? John:  No, it was a very dark night  The hair was long, almost like it was combed and took care of I was near a wildlife area when I observed a large figure standing next to the treeline approximately 15-20 feet from the road After my friend found footprints there this spring I decided it report it. This is not the first time I've heard what I think might be a Bigfoot in the area It just so happens that one of the deputies whom I've been friends with for a long time and had a bigfoot sighting of his own when he was a young man from 1981 which is currently on your website Stan - How tall would you say it was? Mark - I would say close to nine feet We came across a bare footprint And there isn't really a lot traffic over there and when I walked I couldn't believe my eyes I seen footprints, actual footprints, and I knew it couldn't be human, a human wouldn't have walked in that area barefoot, for one there is too many thickets and he would have been crazy if he did and two it was so big Shaq couldn't have a foot that big And it proceeded twice after it did it the first time it did it again a few seconds later and then I heard three like movements in the trees, like cracking and the brush was moving and lo and behold here comes my Lab running back, with the hair all the way up from her neck and all the way down to her tail, and her tail all the way between her legs and her head down and she was looking towards the area where I had heard the noise When in front of me I saw a fast dark moving object, it ran on all fours towards the tree line  The color was, it wasn't a uniform color, it was different shades of brown, dark brown and gray Stan - And what color was it? Mark - Dark, very dark brown I think it was a bigfoot protecting its young in the tree But something in my head clicked, I remember hearing about bigfoot in California, and I thought ""This is one of those bigfoots and I am going to wound this thing and Barnum & Bailey here I come"" It stood the hair up on my back A 7 foot+ ""creature"" crossed in front of me into the old tree farm entrance at a casual pace, clearing the road surface in three steps A blonde bigfoot is the closest I can get to describing what I saw that night What seems incredible is that the seemingly intelligent people on these television shows who adopt the posture of debunking the Bigfoot legend, are the people that are just plain wrong Not the typical dark color we hear about I'm 6'4"" and I had to step up slightly to get into the seat, and as we passed it close up, in the windshield and out the drivers side window its waist was as high as the top of the hood, probably 4 1/2 feet, and the rest was at least that much  She didn't notice the body but the face had a large amount of white hair with a rough expression, the movement was very quick and bounding And it was tall, I would say maybe 7-7and a half feet tall and muscular These were barely noticeable in the dirt, but there were three, with about a 7 foot stride When the eyewitness accounts are: “...sure I’ve seen Bigfoot, one knocked on my door and asked to borrow a cup of sugar”, it just doesn’t lend itself to anything credible What caught my attention was the size, color, and height of the eyes There we discovered more tracks they were the same as ones in the trees, but since it was a corn field that was harvested the previous fall we could determine that the tracks which were in a straight line had a five foot span between prints  i was able to watch it run for several hundred feet, although my vision was hampered by the fog I coon hunted in the dark by myself and never been as frightened as I was with this encounter. Its face was also covered with the same type of hair but shorter and not so much around the eyes nose and mouth  It made the hair on my neck stand up and it also echoed through the neighborhood It occurred to me that my friend who told me about the weird creatures and personal experiences I have been told relates to the behavior of Bigfoots I'm not, I know when I see something like that, I did not believe in big-foot until I seen it that morning Like I said, it was tall, thin, and ran fast, like it only had to take a few steps to cross both lanes. I had just seen something moving through the trees, nine foot tall, orange fur, it just kind of ran through about five feet of brush Right outside of the tree line I saw the back half from the waist up of this bigfoot It came crashing through the weeds and sounded like a person running but with heavier footfalls While sitting on a log this tall thing crossed in front of me through the opening in the woods  We've recently learned this could have been a gift from our large-footed visitor as appreciation for munching on our fruit. Upon further examining the foot print, it was apparent that whatever had been walking there was barefoot I felt eyes on us the whole time we were out there There is no doubt in ether of our minds that someone had walked in the sand with bare feet Me and my sister did find footprints the next day After the discovery of the footprint we discovered a decapitated rabbit Our headlights hit it and I remember it's feet were straddling the white line on the side of the road The feet prints were from bare feet as the toe and heel impression were very reconizable This memory is as clear today as it was the day it happened and still makes the back of my neck hair stand on end So instead of finding two sets of footprints we found like six of them I was bow hunting some public land called Sielbeck just the day after Thanksgiving when I believe I encountered a large, two legged creature just after dark on my way out of the woods So, I was sitting there, getting ready to get my gear when all of a sudden a just got this chill all over me, the hair stood up on the back of my neck, my arms, and something inside just told me ""don't get out of the car"" Tom – After I heard the footsteps and I called out and it made the sound back I started walking back up to the house My friend placed his boot next to the print and it was one and a half times larger than the foot You could plainly see his arms swinging I have seen many eyes from deer having grown up in southern Illinois and these just didn’t seem like deer eyes Then it started to run towards us, it definitely had two feet We seen what we thought were weird footprints so we followed them I had never heard of bigfoot and then subsequent to my sighting, in that same time frame there was a lot of talk about the Momo Monster in Missouri, by Hannibal, which wasn't too far away I seen its knee and its shoulder and went on up and seen its face, which was hairy from top to bottom So they all came out and looked and seen the footprint the timber was to dark on them country roads Tall, black, and very foul smelling I saw him for about a minute or two, it was at least 9' 6"" tall and 60"" wide, he had two fingers missing from one hand because he kinda turned and shielded his eyes for a moment then ran off as he did It was a slightly windy night and very dark and with only one light I couldn’t see where the splash came from or anything in the woods It began to get dark and so we headed back to the truck and left  I could only make out a dark silhouettte These eyes were right on the edge of the corn and the hunting field  It was barely 5 feet tall The people that go to elaborate means by which to create a hoax, such as footprints, etc., are clearly seriously disturbed I do believe it was maybe a Bigfoot As the bacon was starting to sizzle inside my skillet I heard an odd grunt come from inside the sinkhole area close to the edge that was towards me, which was, at this point, approximately ten to twelve feet away from me I was walking down my street and heard what sounded like a guy off in the cornfield yelling, approximately 600 feet away We decided to walk the foot path I am six foot two and I put (It) at around seven and a half feet tall He was brown and hairy Sometime you come out here it's like being in the park, it's a nice beautiful forest reserve, and other times you come out it is just so creepy, you just feel like there are eyes everywhere Since it was very dark, he brought along his 10 million candlepower spot light I estimate it was well over 7 foot tall-(at the time i had a brother 6'8"" and I know it was much taller than he was) As I'm sitting there staring across the lake, the hair on my arms and neck starts to stand up   We shut off the engine and sat there watching him in the dark while a very light misty rain started I told her these look like bigfoot prints so I took some photos of them Couldn't really see just how tall he was but his mass was a lot bigger than the last one I seen but that was in the dead of summer He turned and took one last look at us and disappeared into brush He and I told each other that we will take it to the grave and forever it's our memory! I am a firm believer in Bigfoot! greyish tan in color 7 or 8 feet tall long gaping strides while crossing the road I know exactly the spot I was slightly disoriented from the crash, but what I saw was a large male looking individual, more than 7 feet tall, very heavy built, with thin redish hair covering its body Definitely walking on two legs I stood up to see what was making the loud footsteps This is a very rural area and there is no reason anyone would be standing in the middle of the road on Xmas eve in that kind of weather dressed up like a bigfoot - esp It was maybe 7 to 8 foot range because it was at the mid point of the trees Inside the edge of the woodline mentioned there is an abandoned railroad bed (no rails, etc., and as you travel along it becomes raised to a point of about 10 feet at the end where it runs into a field and drops abruptly) which ""us kids"" used as a bicycle / motorcycle trail When I finally accepted what I was looking at, I knew that these were big foot tracks and I had come feet from seeing them first hand We were ""making out"" on a farm field access in the back seat of my car parked about 20 feet off the road I strained my eyes to see what it was  I don’t know that was I saw was a Bigfoot but I can’t explain it saying it was for anything else either Years ago I was one of the biggest critics and thought that bigfoot was a spoof I was about 120 feet from it And there was also mollusks, fresh water mollusks shell mixed up in the feces, and I took a picture of that and accidentally mishandled that photo and accidentally got deleted when I tried to transfer it to my memory card and to my computer The entirety of the being was covered in brown hair, similar to that of a brown bear, and it was not unkempt As I was passing it turned and looked at me with big glowing eyes It had arms, it was running and it was very big Stan - So the height was about seven foot, what about weight? John - It was really wide, I mean the shoulders I would say four feet She remembered me screaming and also her chasing this “Bigfoot” thing I came upon what looked like a very large footprint There were some darker areas but the most of it was a grey color tall and using the surrounding trees, estimated the creature's height at 7 to 7 1/2 feet Like many times before overseas, the hair on the back of my neck stood up and I could not put my finger on it, but I knew something was off Where we lived we used to see bigfoot on a regular basis So for someone to look in that window has to be more than six foot tall We were on route 32 in Illinois, just north of the Shumway turnoff by about a mile or so, when a large bi-ped appearing around 9' tall, came running out of a cornfield, crossed a ditch as if it weren't there and crossed the highway in three steps then over another ditch into another cornfield Black to blend with darkness The first was a grey color and second one was a dark black color The back yard was a field of head high weeds that had grown up about five feet from the door It sounded like it was within 30 or 40 feet of us but I couldn’t see anything There shouldn't have been anyone walking barefoot down a creek down in the bottoms so that's what really got our attention It started running away from us at a 90 degree angle and was fast but when it got about 200 yards it stood up and ran on two legs and you could its arms swinging real long arms I was traveling along the road when I saw a tall thin hairy bigfoot along a railroad track They were about 4 and one half feet tall I allowed about 45 minutes to go by and it began getting dark We are watching the World Series, it was probably around 9:30 and Lulu, my dog, raised her head and then looked at me with big eyes like “Did you hear that?” And then she turns and looks at the window and I go “Yeah, I heard it.” And I said “Go ahead and get down.” So she got down, came out on the floor and laid down so she could watch the window I was with a friend,we were going to the quarry to go fishing at night,it was about 9pm,I was walking in the lead down a path to the quarry,the path drops off sharply at the edge of the quarry,about a 15 foot drop,so you have to kind of run down it,there was a small sandy area at the bottom next to the water and a path that went all the way around,the area was surrounded with tall weeds and brush,as I ran down the slope I saw a big hairy thing I can only describe as a tall humanoid covered with long hair(about four inches,reddish brown)it was tall and lankey and kind of reminded me of a basket ball player,it was bent over facing away from me,almost neeling on the ground,I was no more than ten feet away from it and as soon as I saw it I turned around and ran back up the incline scared to death hoping it wasnt following me,as I was comming back up I almost ran into my freind who was just at the edge of the drop off,he asked me what I was doing and I was afraid to tell him what I saw,we then went fishing,and I never spoke of it I was staying the night at my friend's house, Sheila, who was one of the three people who saw the ""bigfoot""  It was covered in hair and his face look flattened with a wide nose and large nostrils, and huge eyes They were broadcasting an episode of Monster Quest (not my usual fare), and they were in search of Bigfoot He looked to a point off the cove and noticed a big black figure or ""glob"" in the 6 or 7 foot tall grass  As I crept closer I could tell the thing I was seeing off to the side was much, much taller than a deer The eyes stayed in sight for maybe 45 seconds and disappeared behind back behind the tree and the height of the head never changed I'm 5 foot It has been determined Bipedal homonids existed over six million years ago with the 2001 discovery of the Toumai skull in Western Chad, Africa known as the species Sahelanthropus Tchadenis But unfortunately due to the darkness and lack of lighting equipment, we could not determine any further details of the surrounding terrain Size was estimated from 4 foot to the incredible size of 7 foot tall and weighing somewhere between 120 up to 300 lbs It was very dark outside and about 10pm When it hit me, the smell it was so strong , I began hurrying to get out of the woods as I got to the edge of the woods to an area we call the  grassy area and there it was a foot print The footprints were also barefoot (It) was standing on two legs, leaning on the fence with both upper arms bent I am now 71 years old and know it was Bigfoot, which I didn’t know at the time  I tried to match the stride and wasn't able to come close, neither was my friend who is over 6' tall I am going to be honest, before this happened, when it comes to bigfoot, I have been very skeptical, because there is not enough evidence that would make me even consider that there could be a bigfoot It walked 30 to 40 feet to get through the clearing and it was 40 yards from my deer stand  The eyes like I said before glowed in my headlights We had also heard of several recent sightings of large tracks or foot prints in the Covered Bridge area of rural Sangamon County which is not far from the cemetery My friend said she didn't believe in such a thing as bigfoot but I told her ""well, it was standing right in front of us."" Stan - Were you able to tell what color it was? Mark - It was very dark brown There were three giant footprints We came across a sand bar with a lot of  mussels attached to some shale rocks that protruded up from under the sand as we got closer we saw signs that something had been digging at the mussels at first I thought this could have been any animal doing this but as we got even closer we saw two very detailed foot prints in the sand  It made its way and stepped onto the road about 20 feet away from my car, (by this time at stop) I looked down as I was walking and noticed that I was walking next to a line of footprints in the mud I was just gazing out the window wind I saw what looked like a bigfoot walk out of the tall weeds upon the hill As Im looking thur the woods I can tell its not a person in camo it was black I cant ID what it was but it was on 2 legs I would say by my best guess it was the size of a large man. Weight may have been 325 to 350 Hard to tell because of hair About four years ago I found some foot prints near my drive way, the prints were about six foot apart, you could clearly see the footprints because the day before four inches of snow fell Bigfoot in Farmdale park E What I witnessed had not evolved to the point where it shed it’s hair, but yet displayed bipedalism, and did not have ape-like features As I got closer I could make out a large human like figure, about a foot taller than the corn 2 days ago I saw on the news reported sighting of a bigfoot in Central IL I could see his backside big tall and hairy, very hairy Its face was hairy but you could tell it had a human face to it On several of our fishing trips we would stay out late after dark and catfish The sides of the cheeks hung a bit and the face was not as hairy as the rest of the head The hair on the body was around four inches long Coincidentally, the area on the apple tree directly above the print was devoid of apples while the remainder of the tree was more abundant with fruit  When we got ready to go around the last bend to where we had parked I took a look back and saw ""something"" squatting on a point next to a dead blackened tree which stood  around three to four feet tall   At the top of the hill, the path continued on into a dark stand of timber but as we had not explored that before, I backed the Jeep around and parked it so we could see back to the blacktop, about a mile away As it was running through, it was partly cloudy and there were still some leaves on the trees, and as it was running it ran through a bit of light coming through the canopy I could see that’s fur was dark brownish with a really bright red tint to it when the sun hit it directly show “Finding Bigfoot” – I’ve always had an interest in these creatures I was thinking what was a man doing in a Chewbacca suit out here!  Then I realized it was a Bigfoot The river banks in that area are steep with tall grass At 6.20 in the morning I heard loud footsteps walking through the pasture off to my right shoulder The arms switched back and forth close to the ground as its body was leaning forward Whatever that was walked on 2 legs We were able to put together that one of the bigfoots went out of the tree line which we believe was to scout ahead to cross the field to the West and go to another tree line which would lead directly to the state park  No footprints because the ground was frozen Found no blood, no footprints(it was dry) but I did find something I didnt expect...it had laid down when I began shooting and must've been there for a while because there was a flattened area that looked like a deer bed  She described it as ""huge"" -  about 10 feet tall, with a head as large as a steering wheel  Its front legs moved as if a human would be leaning over a tricycle peddling and its back legs moved with a human running motion including what appeared to be knees Some of the tracks had drag marks on the toe portion and had some wisp marks from the hair which made course, distinct marks in the snow This figure was very large, broad shoulders and standing on two legs  It appeared to be black, with a round ""hairy"" face It was a dark dirty black/grey color it was about 11pm  when me and my nephew decided to go and check the lines we had set about 50 yrds or so away from where we had set out chairs and fire  She said it looked like a very large man covered in red hair and had a pointed head I remember looking away for a few minutes, before looking back up, and spotted him running full-tilt with a look of panic in his eyes It sounded like growling, snorting and huffing and was about 30 feet away  It started walking (on two legs) and crossed the road Standing on the other side of the gate, only sixty feet away or so, was a 7 foot or better figure, covered in dark brown fur There are horses in that field, they were running and their eyes were full of fear Because we had not planned on doing anything more than a walkthrough of the cemetery we did not have our usual camera and lighting equipment with us, so we took several photos of the footprints with James’ cell phone camera I have saw what I would call a big foot three times The body was very hairy and was greyish he stood there and looked at me bent down and stared right in my eyes It did was not reminiscent of any type of monkey, ape or gorilla, as it’s face was also completely covered in hair  The eyes didn’t seem like a deer but there are no other animals in this area that have eyes that big that could be that far off the ground  Tall corn, tall grass, soy beans, bushes and trees.  I never heard these things but I was also at the front of the line and 15 feet in front of them It was  tall and lean like a track runner It was big, brown, hairy and very fast  There was a slight breeze and I could see the hair moving somewhat in the wind I should say prints, as I found 2 or 3 more heel impressions back from it, with about a 7 foot stride, but they were hard to make out, as other stuff had torn up the trail, so I didn't photograph them It had legs that seemed to have no shape I could not see its face in great detail due to the distance, but I could make out a lighter color in the facial area, as to less hair It’s eyes were dark brown with no white, and they gave a dog-like friendly impression  I think what I saw was a ""bigfoot"" even though the eyes, hair, and smell parts don't match other people's stories. • The animal as it came out of the ditch was initially on all fours and then stood up on two legs and walked away We both turn to each other at the same time and said, ""Did you see that?"" We slowed down, but it was too dark to see much Also we got to looking around the hog house to see if we could find any more footprints And, it stands up and it's like eight or nine feet tall, it looked like a black humanoid Stan - What about eye color? John - Eye color was brown, I did not see a whole lot of white of the eyes, I did see some It wasn't huge but very tall, but muscular But fell short roughly a few feet The foot prints were distinct it was pitch black and then i got the chills and thought that thing might be in there...i went back to my car and have not run on that trail since! Finding Bigfoot show reminded me of this. I have not observed any footprints on the soft sandbars Stan – I know you had a ruler next to the footprint, how long did you think it was? Tom – It is 14 inches long The eyes shown emerald green when the head lights shown on them During the summer months of July and August my family has had a number of events that we have heard and seen what we believed to be a big foot here in Central Illinois I don't know if anyone else has ever seen bigfoot As we were looking around the mound of dirt, we noticed what looked like a fairly large foot print I could tell that it was quite a bit taller than me, and wider Biped! I just seen sasquatch (a strange thin, tall, muscley one) We have had lots of rain this year so that dirt turns to mud, I have been looking at the ground for arrow heads, and have seen several bare footprints ranging in size from a size 13 to three inches longer than my size 13's I didn't see its face, its hair was in the way 1 of the times while I was riding aprox 200 yds off the road, I spotted a bigfoot aprox 7 ft tall and probably 400lbs Millions of years later, our ancestors, Homo Erectus had shed it’s hair and became well adapted to endurance running as a means to hunt and capture prey It landed at my feet and then silence took hold in the trees again Every time the conditions were the same, it was a cool night slightly windy and very dark The headlights hit its eyes and it turned away and we saw it walk off. The tracks went a little north but stopped as if the big foot observed the deputy coming from the North This thing was HUGE! I'm not exaggerating it had to be close to ten feet tall, with white to grayish colored fur It’s no wonder that Bigfoot creatures would attempt to evade any humans and avoid discovery Then I wondered if it could have been the elusive BIG-FOOT The foot print was found under the most mature and biggest of apple trees with a level muddy area under it amongst a sloping yard that leads to the stream It was dark outside  I continued to watch this thing run up a twenty foot embankment on the other side of the road without ever losing its pace Bigfoots? I got to the parking lot on East River road and left.  As I watched to make sure it was a thumbtack a head turned and looked at me and I could clearly make out two eyes I never heard the sounds but one of the stories told was chain sounds on concrete, door handles shaking, footsteps on the front porch, and deep growling noises I found tracks that looked like a human foot It walked on 2 legs  Since it was not quite dark, my headlights did not illuminate the animal well, yet it was still light enough to see the creature  As I approached a hill that was just east of the Hagaman turnoff I noticed a tall reddish brown creature crossing the highway going north There were only about eight footprints in total It had dark reddish brown hair about 2 to 3 inches long all over except for the head and face which was grey and white and I could even see light flesh under it I have pictures of very large footprints outside our house when my brother was camping here He took pictures with a tape measure along the footprint Tom – Then the next morning we went outside and there was a footprint out there I look north towards the edge of field I see a dark figure walking down the edge of the field, I thought it was a tresspasser walking to go hunt  it then turned and ran...within 3 or 4 strides it was able to hurdle a 5-6 foot fencing without breaking stride However it was stocky and I could see dark tanish colored skin threw its hair But then from that place a huge rock was thrown at us and landed 15 feet from the boat with a giant splash I returned the following spring and documented large foot prints a couple miles away from the same camp site It had shinny black hair About a week before, my nephew called and said there are footprints in a subdivision south of Chatham As I got closer i saw a bigfoot just standing in the middle of the road looking at me as if it was blinded by my headlights Me and my mom were driving home from dropping a friend off when about a 7 1/2-foot-tall creature ran across the road We trolled around the banks of the lake all morning and all day fishing for smallmouth bass till just before dark It was about 8 feet tall brown in color but was in the shade of the trees  You don’t really see these bluffs above the river from the blacktop but it is probably at least a hundred feet higher than the fields below, and took the Jeeps transmission into low range to climb it with the mud I was on the lower side of the hill so I could not get a real good estimate on height but I'm going to say it had to be at least 7 feet high Stan - Can you please explain what you saw? Mark - It was just before football and I was trying to get into shape so I went for a run While watching an episode of Finding Bigfoot I heard them talk about Bigfoots chattering and how it sounded like people that you couldn’t understand The 3rd instance was a series of footprints along the bank of the lake fork river It was only about fifty yards away from me crossing the road, all of eight foot tall, long light brown hair It sounded like it was about 50 feet away, and you could hear the huge volume it created from it's lungs, almost like from there, and not its throat I told him the ironic thing about this was that everyone else that has spotted bigfoot at the river prob just saw him! he did not think that was very funny Is it possible that my Bigfoot is simply an example of the early evolution of some mammal (a bear perhaps) destined to fail in it’s survival like that of our many humanoid predecessors? After all, it has been surmised that ninety-nine percent of all species that at one time populated this earth, have become extinct My 17 year old and I were coming home from my best friend's house in Lockport, IL,151st to Wolf Road, to 143rd we were driving east on 143rd going to La Grange Road, at 12:20 am on the left hand side of the road, along side the road from the forest preserve was this 7-8 ft all black ape-like creature standing there, I slowed down but didn't come to a stop, I couldn't believe what my son and I saw, my son told me to turn around which I did, we headed back and saw nothing it must have headed back in the woods, my son and I both saw, broad shoulders, long arms it was huge, almost tempted to get out of car and look but we both said no and went home, I did call the Orland Park police dept next day to report and operator said that's a new one on him he never had a call on that before, all I know what we saw wasn't human.  The eyes seemed to be 5 to 6 feet off the ground  Within four foot from my side of the car It was months later I saw an episode of Finding Bigfoot where Matt and Bobo found something very similar to what I found only the one I found was much bigger Right footprint found the 24th of October 2011 showing a length of 14 inches It had long brown reddish hair  The creature was described as 5 feet 8 inches tall, broad shouldered, with red eyes that cannot stand light As we came to a stop just off the road, before we started to back up onto the main road, a creature about as tall as the Ford van we were in started to cross the side road from our left to right about 15 to 20 feet in front of the van I had never heard of Bigfoot at that time but I'm sure it was him now   The ponds were found by taking a very narrow unpaved dirt track to the left before the bridge, and then off again through fields until it came to a dead end along the river and ponds fringed with large stands of tall trees The foot print in my opinion based on the size of my husband's shoe size would be a man's size 12 shoe So, that footprint happened I believe Sunday night I could see that it was not wearing any clothes, but also did not see long hair either  What I do know is that my husband is 6'2"" and when I asked him later that day to reach up to try and touch that branch that my 'creature' had to duck to avoid, he couldn't reach it and it was about a foot higher than his extended arm This is when its legs were seen, a lighter shade of road behind them About 8 feet tall walking with a long stride crossed the road in front of me, about 100 ft Whatever it was it seems to not be so frequent, but now that I have heard what you say is a bigfoot on your website I will make sure NOT to investigate it.. Then I say did you her that and she was like yes what was that, I though it had to have been a bigfoot...It was like nothing I have ever heard in my life  The eyes seemed to be about 40 feet away and it was like they sidestepped behind the tree, never looking away from me When it was standing up straight, about where it's hips were, was as tall as the hood of my friends truck I couldn't see it's face, but when it's head tilted up toward me, the hair stood up on end Stan: When you first saw the big one and you just saw a silhouette why did you think it was a bigfoot? Tom: At first I didn't know what to think Around five years ago me and a buddy were mushroom hunting and came across about ten feet prints walking down a almost dried creek The creature was up on its hind legs and seemed to be stooped over It scared me because it was covered with a thick coat of hair like an ape It was definately walking on two legs, and it was entirely too fast to be my uncle  I called my friend over while I looked at it thinking, this doesn't make any sense, who else would be back here and why would they be barefooted? We again spread out and now I was head down and focused on finding more foot prints There was a CNN news report about a year ago that hunters, equipped with night vision photographic equipment, in Pennsylvania took pictures of an unidentified biped covered in hair in a half bent over position with it’s back to the camera  We had to cross a smaller fallen log, in low range to get back to that point, but it had a wide open area about a hundred feet in diameter that made a good place to turn the Jeep around so it was pointing in the right direction  It was at least 7-8 feet tall and was in the standing position Who's that tall to begin with? I am a hunter and have spent many hours in the wood but, have never seen anything like that before or after. And we looked up and there was what we call in Illinois - MOMO, it's bigfoot, and it was squatting up and down scratching his back on a tree On the trail there was what looked like a footprint, bare footprint It was standing a good 2 1/2' above the sycamore saplings and was covered in hair Well after Dad died I had started to work on farms to help Mom out and pay my way so I spent less time in the woods I could clearly see the entire outline of the foot, as well as 5 distinct toe prints  The creature was very dark and hairy it was running on all fours, yet it was very tall It had just gotten dark so I can guess the time  The sun was to it's back and cast a shadow on it's face but I could make out the shine in it's eyes I looked where they were looking and saw a hairy humanoid figure I probably got about 1 minute walking away from them when about 20 feet away a huge dark furred creature standing around 7 feet tall (maybe) crossed perpendicular to the trail I was walking on It happened in the late 1970's when a friend of mine while running his traps along a small strip-mine pond  noticed a line of very large, bare-foot, humanlike footprints in the mud along the receded water line of the pond we had a moderate thaw, but we could see definite toes and a human-like shape, definitely bipedal. • The animal was very close to the car, perhaps 30 feet Stan - And what time of day was this? Jennie - That was probably right before it got dark out My wife, daughter and I saw a very large dark figure cross the road no more than 50 feet in front of us And I took maybe two or three steps after that and I looked up and saw… he was seven to seven and a half feet tall, I’m guessing, he was probably bigger, I was terrified at the time If a tree breaks in a storm they usually snap or they de-root, these are just broken like at a four, five or six foot level like they have been yanked, fibers are still all connected, it just appears to be pulled over, there are dozens of them throughout the woods I only wanted to tell you that I saw a big foot in the 1990's possibly early 2000 We arrived at eagle creek around six thirty it was still very dark out but had our lanterns with us  I was telling them about the BFRO site and of the pictures of bigfoot tracks in the snow following deer tracks I was approximately 78 yards away according to my range finder I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me as to what I had seen it was gray with a slight bit of tan and brown mixed into its coat They said it was about 7' tall, dark hair and sort of hunched over I got to the end of the tall grasses and could see there was still a worn path but it was leading around a large bush The area was fertile bottom land just about 50 feet from a bridge over a small creek I never believed in bigfoot or things of that nature It was walking too tall for a human He went on to say that there was a recent report in Canada of a camper that claimed a juvenile Bigfoot entered his tent We couldn't tell what it was but it's head did stick up above the four foot fence My guess he was approximately 8 or 9 ft tall • The hair was dark brown I didn't and don't believe in big foot, but I don't know what else it could have been Like I said, I never saw it, I just heard it and heard it's foot falls, it was absolutely two legged, it was huge, and I don't think it wanted to say hello But I can't help remember what I saw with my own eyes. I did not get a very good look at the other one but it did appear to be 8 to 10 feet tall The inside of the hole had a profuse growth of young oak, maple and other hardwood trees that were approximately 4 to 5 years old and about twenty feet tall I saw a creature running on top of a levee just on the east Peoria side of the river.It was all tan from head to feet It was covered in matted burgundy hair. It measured nineteen inches long, seven and a quarter inches wide at the ball of the foot where the toes connect and it was five and a half inches wide at the heel Walking very quickly like it knew where it was going I would estimate it to be 6 to 7 feet tall I just remember it wasn't a person, eight foot tall and it was all furry, but it wasn't a gorilla face I watched it watch us drive away in my rearview for about a minute then it ran away on it's legs just like a human It was twice the size of a normal human's foot There was big footprints in the snow from the pasture to the river. He rushed over there and got his .45 and then he announced out loud ""that we were both scared and we [were] both armed we were going to start shooting."" So, anyone out in the dark like that would first of all have a flashlight Across the river in the dark shadows of the forest a shadowy figure emerged I tried to track it but it left behind no prints that I could find after it went over our fence.The night before I found the footprints near our driveway, I heard my dog going towards the end of our drive sounding like he was wanting to attack something, I thought it was coyotes so I went outside but I didn't hear or see anything In the split seconds it was full on in the head lights standing I saw a medium build, not massive at all, but thick, hair was 4-6"" and flat black in color with just a little bluish silver reflection from the headlights and the face was a lighter shade than the hair like charcoal grey, I don't recall seeing breasts and the hair seemed thinner and shorter on its front It also had a big pair of yellow eyes Some people don't know that a deer will stand up on its hind legs so that it can see over corn in the fields  As we got closer I noticed hair so I looked it up and down and what I was looking at really shocked me I looked back up the road and there was a very tall upright animal walking across the road, stepped over the guard rail and disappeared underneath the bridge Because I went twice a day, right before it got light out in the morning and just before dark at night  I started slowing down but didn't slam the brakes because it was still many feet away, and I knew I had more than enough time to slow down my car Thru the screen door I could see a large dark figure walking across my pasture going to my barn When I got back to Utah I looked up big foot sightings up in some book and it had mentioned there had been a few in Southern Illinois area so I didn't feel too bad I could't believe my eyes About six foot, broad shoulders, no neck, a lot like a man but hairy. As we got closer I saw the garbage was fast food bags and the black garbage bag had arms and a head! When we were maybe 5-6 car lengths away it swung its arms out in front of it and shot straight up, taking a small step backwards Anyway he was leaving after dark in his truck and his dog was running ahead of him on the dirt road about 50-100 yrds out when he turned the bend looking for his dog he seen it and said it was huge at that point his dog b-lined it strait to the truck and jumped in  It had hair covering the body, but not matted or curly like you see in shows or movies The creature was a few feet from my barn and I noticed its head was level with the bottom of the roof of my barn It was swinging its arms that looked like they were too long for its torso I went running and stopped at the road and looked in front of me and saw this big tall thing standing in the road looking right back at me, I saw the outline of it, it was too far away to tell what it was But we didn’t find any more, but we did find a clump of hair stuck to a metal piece in the window of the hog house  It sent the hair up on my neck and scared me a little because the only thing between me and the yelling was a row of houses I could hear some footsteps same interval steps that was west of me now back in the trees Object was about 7 foot tall. We have to walk about 2 hours back to parking lot before dark and heavy rain on that night tall, swinging from limb to limb and just playing in the tree I sat back and thought wow, the trees are two hundred feet away, what is back there that smells so bad I saw something large, black and hairy take two-three giant bounds across the road before it disappeared on the other side It was bigfoot  figure DID NOT look like a big hairy ape.....very tall, slender and very large eyes...color appeared simialar to a local deer I was almost to the curve when it turned and ran, on two legs, into the cornfield, to the west, which leads to some woods I was driving and I was on the phone and I looked to my right and I saw something very, very tall, like between 8 and 9 foot and hairy There was perhaps another 300 feet to the bridge from that curve and by the time I reached it I had goosebumps the size of eggs and my hair, what's left of it, was trying to stand up It appeared to be greyish in color and ran with its arms down in a pendulum type motion Foot prints in the snow It was grayish-black in color and stood about 7 feet tall We didn't get a good look at it but what we saw I would estimate between 7 - 8 ft tall But the other day we talked about it for some reason and we concluded that it must have been bigfoot I believe that there are Bigfoot that inhabit this area while it was still dark, hoping a deer would come in right at light I told my uncle and he said ""Yeah its a weird looking track, it looks like a foot.""  It had five toes It was around 7 or 8 feet tall and it looked like it had a hunch back"
Indiana," I saw the creature from behind and the side while it was squating down and eating our food that we had tied up in a tree, about 12 to 15 feet up I have been an amateur bigfoot researcher for many years, and am convinced that one, possibly more, are inhabiting the woods behind my house. then we go to another bigfoot recording  The next morning I noted that the place that I saw this dark figure the night before the grass looked like a deer bed (matted down like when deer bed down in tall grass to sleep) and you could see where it pushed down the grass to leave I have had two possible ""Bigfoot related"" incidents You can go left up the steep hillside (several hundred feet climb) or continue on your right along the Lake The body was black and hairy although the face was huge and long in the jaw shaped like a knight of a chess piece but not like a horse! My husband describes the face more like a lions shape after sunrise so still pretty dark The foot prints were alot larger then my foot in slippers which is a women's 9.5 wide They had a lit a Coleman lantern as it became dark about 8:50 p.m I first heard a noise, which sounded like heavy footsteps,and corn being pushed aside I could see that the head was very large, there was coarse hair on top and sticking out to the sides in places, but the face was in shadow The porch light doesn't work so it was dark He was at least 8 1/2' tall, I was the same height on my 4 wheeler as I was standing, and I looked way up at it  Then, I thought, stupid guy, no hunter orange and then I began to notice strange things like he had no gun, and that he was the same color from head to toe, no hat, no hunter orange?  But then what I really noticed was that his arms were long, his hands were swinging at his knees and though he was taking large steps crossing the road very quickly but without running, he was just walking I  have been reluctant to beleive what my mother says because she has always been a little squirrley, it runs in her family, but she told me several years back that my uncle was outside one night drunk as usual, another reason i was reluctant to believe her, but the story goes that something big and hairy got after him and he crawled up under the pickup truck to keep it from getting him  It was after sunset but not yet dark  It was as tall as the corn which in Indiana at that time of the year is at least seven to eight feet tall The silhouette stood appox 6-7 foot tall, was covered in long dark brown fur/hair, and stood on two legs with a bit of a bend forward Was it on two legs or four? He said two The corn was very tall I am a 40 year old engineer and have been passively interested in Bigfoot since I was a kid A minuet or two passes then Splash! This time he is ready with the light and sees the spray of water from the impact about 30-40 feet away  Blue River is about 30 to 40 feet across at the point where they were fishing) The headlights caused the eyes to shine red and I could make out the shape of a large figure  we could hear heavy foot falls the closer the creature got to us and we heard splashing as it rounded a pond that was at the bottom of the trail, down the hill from us  i would estimated this thing to be about seven to eight foot tall, very muscullar build, large powerful thighs and arms, covered in dark brown/black hair I wear a size thirteen shoe and I could put my foot in these prints with a couple of inches longer and wider to spare  She said she woke up one morning and saw a large, yellow, hairy creature looking through the door When he got to the bridge, he went down on all fours and began to cross it using his arms and hands, as well as his feet About a month or 2 ago my husband went outside to smoke he heard something and as he looked in our drive way he seen an animal that stood about 7 feet tall all hairy he couldn't explain it except that it looked like one of our dogs on 2 feet and extremely tall I could see a tall man moving between the popular trees very strangely high on the hill side near the dam to our right A tree had fell down and was stuck in an angle into another tree and it was about 7 foot up on the tree that was leaning We were in a boat, at a remote part of the reservoir not accessible by vehicle or foot I froze when suddenly the corn in front of me split apart, and standing in front of me was a very tall, and very thick dark  figure.I did not look all the way up: I was very startled.There was a very strong odor.I can still smell it when I think about it It was gone but wet foot prints that looked like they were made with soggy fuzzy bedroom slippers were across the floor Too dark to take a shot, so instead of spooking the deer, I decided to wait for it to move out so that I might have another chance at it the next day The whites of his eyes I'll never forget because his eyes were what I was stuck on the most, the rest of him was at a glance or not big foot but some unknown creature that is out there and no one can seem to pin point what it is so they use the name ""bigfoot"" we never did go back to the peninsula on monroe lake that hunting year We've never believed in bigfoot till we seen it and have heard them I'm sure there are more than one around here cause we live near caves they sound like they are all around us at night.  I could see the trees and tree trunks fine but not the bark because the tree trunks were silhoutetted and that's what I mean about not seeing the fur, it was all one shade of dark brown So as they started to knock more excitedly, it began to walk away quickly to the east on the shore line, but then abruptly turned around and began to move much quicker right back across the yard where it had been and toward the marshy area and light woods and tall grass immediately south of the porch and trailer I was within arms length of whatever it was when it made a heavy sigh or grunt, kinda like a strong exhale, and then suddenly it just ran around me me and my friend are both believers of big foot  I said if you did see a bigfoot, your one lucky guy!  This is the truth It scarred me pretty good not because of its size but it was about 5 to 10 feet from me After waiting for about 10 minutes it got pretty dark in the woods The footfalls stopped at the top of the incline and then, whoever this was, took off running full bore into the deeper parts of the forest On the way back up the steep hill that lead back to the fire trail my oldest son said to me, ""Dad, do you think that Daisy (our dog) saw a big foot?"" Not actually seeing anything myself, all I could tell him is, ""mmmm, maybe?""  It is like your mind refuses to believe what the eyes are telling it because it is so new, different and without a reference point Officially I can not say for sure it was a ‘Bigfoot’, only that it was walking up right on two legs, had two arms, a chest, and torso and was covered in long dark brown fur/hair. The two of them, without waking the others, went onto the screened porch, which was in front, towards the river, and in the darkness, with a 22 rifle and only the bridge lights shining, they waited As they gathered their gear, Splash! something hits the water again about 20 feet away! Finally just as everything was ready to go, Splash! something big hit the water so close the water spray hit the bank where they had been standing a few seconds earlier I was about ninety feet from it Then after a few month of seeing nothing, it was a afternoon full sun and it was a mild day, my wife and I where siting at the kitchen table when a dark figure about 6 foot maybe shorter went down the drive towards the road As he passed under the floodlight on the cabin side, he was clearly seen, as huge, covered with dark hair, and walking upright like a man There would 2 or 3 footfalls, a sliding sound then 20-30 seconds of silence  I wanted to check out what I just saw and was hoping to find a footprint in the ground or on a patch of snow and I went slowly back and forth, traversing this rather steep hill going a little deeper down as I moved back and forth They live about 3/4 of a mile back off the road in a trailer in the middle of a thick woods with alot of tall cedar and pine trees oaks and walnut trees also  His color was dark brown and I thought could that have been a man in a one piece Carhartt outfit or if he were a hiker lost wouldn't he just have stayed on the road rather than go down a steep hill when it was almost dark or if lost why didn't he ask me for help?  He was about six feet tall but very husky with his hands, body, feet, side of his head-face, all one color The footfalls were heavy enough to be heard distinctly apart from the shuffling of leaf litter I first aimed the gun at the Bigfoot and it did not move  They were stooped forward and looking down and swinging their long arms quickly We never found any footprints or anything of that sort but I am positive after hearing the same noises on the sound clips on this site that what we encountered was a sasquatch. Seen the white one on youtube but this one looked more human, people report red triangulated eyes, smelly & long matted coat, this one was none of that When I was a little girl,before i'd heard of bigfoot , i saw in a small woods down from our house what i called a big white hairy thing so we were just stitting on our colapsable chairs facing the water looking by this time it was about 5 mins There were footprints everywhere  It was about seven and one half feet tall and very hairy  We did hear a strange scream once about 15 minuets after dark, way off in the distance, like a half mile away, upstream As we was leaving Indian creek and entering suger creek at the spot we were at the day before except on the other side, I noticed to my left along the cliff face was a stack of rocks about a foot and a half tall stacked right on top of each other quickly clicking on the video a picture of so called ""big foot' showed up and then a audio started My mother heard the footsteps, and the corn breaking, but did not see what I had seen. She raced toward me with her tail between her legs and nearly tripped me trying to hide behind me I didn't have a flash light with me at the time and it was starting to get pretty hard to see so I went back to the house and as I walked down the road (which is a dead end road), I got within about 150, 200 feet of the house and that's when this big large dark thing appeared in front of me They knew that if the creature was going to cross it, he would walk right by them, about ten feet away, and pass under the light We've heard whistles and calls of what a bigfoot sounds like The big white hairy thing was a beige white color  with a cone head sloping back from it's brow ridge.Short hair over its entire visable body ecept for its hands and face longer hair like a cloak over its shoulders.It was june or july...summer time...it's face was brown like leather its eyes peircing black ...a broad flat nose.. There stood this Bigfoot with one foot in the water and one on the bank They are both dissabled and don't need to be back there alone but they are too stubborn to sell it and get closer to town and when they are gone that land will go to us and I don't intend on sharing it with ""Old Hairy."" He's gonna have to pack his family and move on There, in the darkness, coming out of the woods slowly, was the same creature that had frightened the family ten years ago way taller.. But the head looking in the tent, and the stealthiness of the visitor, clued me in that this was not a ""man"" looking to scare us but rather likely a startled Bigfoot (the first encounter) and then an inquisitive Bigfoot (second encounter) The jeep was parked in a small grassy clearing used for camping and the two pits were appox 50 feet east of the jeep with the fence and tree line 10 to 20 feet beyond the pits They stood quietly, and soon the creature was beside them, about ten feet away  This man/bigfoot came out of thick brush between the trees to my left on the opposite side of the road from where I was parked, maybe thirty five or forty yards down the road at an angle but it had to know that I was there or at least that my car was there  So, maybe it was ""just some guy"" out squatting and then standing in 5 inches of lake water at 1:AM in the middle of the country?  Well, when I'm 6 foot and about 200 pounds, and they see some ""guy"" who's way taller than me and a lot larger.. it still remains a mystery of could have made that noise but as of now me and my friend both say what we heard was bigfoot  It crossed the distance of at least 200 feet in less than 20 seconds It was loud enough to be heard over a 100 feet away in a running stream of water  My eyes told me that I just saw a bigfoot but my brain and common sense was trying to dispute that  Logic says ""no"", my eyes say, ""yes"" and that's my report the best that I can remember it John said this time he saw the column of water spray shoot up into the air about 20 feet It had rusty reddish-brown hair which hung down over its eyes like a sheep dog My fiancé’s eyes were wide as saucers  Looking up I was amazed to see a very tall large animal standing next to the tree A huge creature, about seven feet tall, walking on two legs, covered from head to toe, with long dark hair, was walking the other way, towards the treeline it had a very long stride walk and slumped over as it walked I froze fearing that it was an escaped sow, but the footsteps sounded like a two legged step, not four The strange looking person or bigfoot began pacing back and forth looking in the direction of our boys It had been dark for almost an hour when they heard a huge splash in the water about 150-200 feet up stream (to their left)  The tall dark man behind to move down the hillside to the edge of the water looking toward our boys in the water ""We were fishing in the river and right after it got dark somebody kept throwing BIG rocks or something in the water where we were fishing trying to scare us off It was as tall as the corn in the field next to it My friends and I were going for a walk and we came across a bare footprint Then my wife said did you see that? I replied the dark figure out in the drive By this time, the creature had crossed the bridge and was in the darkness beyond  To this day I still believe it was a bigfoot He was walking upright, on two feet Well, as I approached the tree while turning the atv left the thing (which was on my right) and I locked eyes  At that point I did feel the hair on the back of my neck stand on end by the splash it made in the water about 10 feet from the boat I, still to this day, want to take a lie detector so bad to prove to them and everyone that I did, in fact, have a loaded gun aimed at a Bigfoot and decided not to shoot  The area is typical of the region; rolling hills, and a patchwork of farms and woods I said bigfoot didn't eat you so he won't eat me I will say this, he didn't know about the bigfoot sites or even mention the name bigfoot during the telling of this tale  He's also not approximately in the range of 8 feet tall, and built large at that height I can't say positively that it was a bigfoot but that is what my eyes saw at my guess it seem to be at least 9ft tall i say i was about 100yds away The footfalls were very distinctly bipedal and NOT the rapid sound of deer footfalls and we were sitting roughly 30-40 feet from shore  I'll have to just agree with her - based on the evidence, she saw 2 Bigfoots crossing the road They decide to shine the light on it and then shoot a couple paintballs at it when ""it"" starts to get up revealing that it isn't a dog, just some LARGE hairy...??? bigger than a man..  After all I was the Biology major in college, I'm the outdoorsman and I'm the bigfoot enthusiast - I'm the one who should have seen them! I asked all the typical questions that the BFRO interviewers asked and she answered them all correctly, even adding additional detail It looked hairy but I wasn't sure ""It"" stood taller than the van so to speculate on the height I would say over 6"" easily He'd awakened to see a large arm (he never specified anything other than it was very large and the hand was large and dark) reaching in the van window and taking food out of the front seat They could see that as it was getting up, it was large, hairy, more like a person and not a dog Its coat was brownish orange with 2-3"" straight hair It was approximately 6ft tall, grey in color and very, very strong looking. She started to run up the hill again, but stopped short only about 10 feet from us and again raced back behind me and looking up the hill  It was either covered with really dark brown or black fur and had rather long arms that swung loosely as it moved now before this incedent we would always make fun of the bigfoot tv shows and the people who believe in big foot i just froze got goose bumps all over and the back of my hair stood up  She saw crossing the road from left to right,(heading south) approximately 250 feet ahead, two large, black, hair covered figures, taller than an average man walking on two legs at a hurried pace After I did my business, I went back to camp and the other persons agreed they heard the footfalls and thought it was me My friend/co-worker is not at all interested in cryptozology or Bigfoot and would not take the time to write this report, therefore, with his permission I am submitting this report to you on his behalf The opposite bank is a steep hillside that goes up a hundred feet or more at an angle of about 80 degrees On my way back going down the same road in about the same place a dark figure looked like it was crouching in the tall grass along the road I at first thought that my eyes where playing tricks on me so I didn't say anything  His arms were swinging wide like a British soldier marching but he didn't seem to be in any hurry and he completely ignored me like I wasn't there but he had to know that I was there  About ten feet away from the tent, this huge dark hairy creature was squatting licking out my can of bean dip Then next thing we know the dogs, all 3 come running down the path past us with there tails between there legs, heading the way we came into the woods  A very large and definitely bipedal animal was walking down the field towards the woods I decided it was time to go, my sons who are age 9 and 10 began to get spooked by all this excitement and honestly, so was I! All day long I had made up excuses for the weird noises we heard because I didn't want to say bigfoot or sasquatch around them and make them afraid to go into the forest My wife was riding with me so I never reacted because she would have screamed bloody murder if she would have seen it, it was 3 feet from us.. Now the other two could hear the sound of ""this guy?"" running heavily into the tall grass, sticks, branches and all the stuff that was down in the woods between the trailer and the lake, but then heard it starting to move closer in up the hill It was a howl that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up I'm 6' tall 250lbs and rigid, I'm an old country boy and fear no man and could match or best most in strength, but this thing was no man, it was massive and was barely hiding behind this massive tree I could not make out facial features or hair because of the fog and the fact that it was at least twenty yards into the field  We could hear branches breaking along the path from the pond as the heavy foot falls got closer My hair was standing up on my arms and head and it really scared me  I have been a Bigfoot enthusiast for many years and have read of this happening before to people seeing a Bigfoot My brother-in-law at the time, found a clump of hair that matched the description of what I saw stuck in the bark of a tree a couple of hundred yards into the woods by the cornfield  The woods were dark and the only visuals we had were from the light of our fire the title said bigfoot noises and pictures  I guess in the world of Bigfoot research that's called knocking We didn't have tools to measure, photograph or record what we saw as we didn't think it was ""bigfoot"" but rather an animal or the other property owner at that point  After  pulling into the yard up near the trailer, they walked in the dark up to the porch and started to knock Every night about the same time you can hear footsteps and sounds we have gone to the peninsula before multiple times to waterfowl hunt.and we went out early morning when it was still dark About one hour later, we heard the familiar footfalls, this time descending the valley wall on the opposite side of the creek Not much of a neck but its head was huge, its eyes were 2-3 times bigger, but just like ours with whites and pupil >]  You see, somewhere about a year ago, he and a friend were out running around with flashlights and a paintball gun after dark, when they see what they thought was a stray dog laying in some tall grass between two of our outdoor sheds"
Iowa," He said it was solid white and tall ""I think those people have seen something, but I don't know if its this Bigfoot connection they are talking about."" Andersen was first called to Ottsen in July when three boys, ages 10 to 12 came home terrified from something they'd seen near the sales barn at the edge of town Well in total I've had 5 encounters the first one being about a year ago I was bow hunting and this big hairy man like thing just came up and sat right under my tree stand I was thinking about shooting him but I didn't want to scare him out of the country so I sat there quiet as possible then he just got up and trotted off Since mid-July, the Humboldt and Kossuth county sheriff's offices have received numerous complaints from farmers and residents in the Ottosen, West Bend, and Homboldt area who have seen a large, hairy creature or have been awakened by strange screams and an eerie, high- pitched  whistle It waded about fifty foot out raising it's feet out of the water bringing them down flat on the water, kind of a sploosh-sploosh effect 17-18"" X 7-8"" footprints, in a single line - heal to toe - with approx It was just turning dark so he didn't get a good look at it, but because he was so close there was no mistaking it's size It was easily 7-8 feet tall, was very skinny/lanky, and was covered with shaggy, matted brown hair It had a very arched back, it walked or strides were strange Newell said he saw a tall, hairy hunchbacked figure go into the barn About then the whatever straightened up and walked right at us, the eyes were 6-7 feet above the water, and then the thought came to mind, dont bears while in the water generally walk on all fours? You can call this animal very dark brown or blackish color He stopped in a rural portion of West Des Moines and watched as two Bigfoot creatures walked calmly by the side of the road I was aproxametley 6 years old and was helping my mother cut some weeds out of the feild before my father combined and we discoverd some very large footprints heading from the end of the field towards the house At the closer distance it appeared overall dark and shaggy I saw no clear footprints out there I mean it had a head, shoulders, arms and legs, chest On the edge of town there was a park, Stone State Park, consisting of 1132 acres surrounded by farms and overlooking the big Sioux River, dividing Iowa and South Dakota  When I put my boot into the footprint it wouldn't touch the outline of the footprint!  The hill I was on had a gentle slope to the South where it finally turned into trees, bushes, and weeds Next to me were a couple of snowmobiles and about 5 feet in front of me was a red quad and I was on the far right corner of concrete pad  It would not be until the fall of 1986 when I had my second encounter with a Bigfoot that ran across the road in front of my car one night while driving down a gravel road in the southern Rocky Mountains in southern New Mexico  I told him it sounded like bigfoot stories my dad read to me as a child and my husband said he doesn't believe in bigfoot but it was just too fast to see its features the hair seemed to blend in perfectly  It could have been 12 feet tall if it was standing up.]  i was only 20ft from this thing     June of 2000 sight of unkown animal about 6-7 foot tall, from a distance black hauiry greature,which stood on 2 legs and was able to cross the cedar river in west idle wild park was seen by B.W ""To me, it looked like it had a monkey's face and kind of had hair all over It was aproximately 2:55 am when I was awakened by the sound of footsteps in the dry leaves  Until the bigfoot programs I had never considered that what we had encountered could be a bigfoot It was a beautiful summer night and just light enough to see in the dark I was looking to the back staring at this particular tree that stood out to me, when suddenly something very tall, very large, stepped away from the tree looking at me Iowa Flap Continues From newspaper account: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- From the Register; September 24, 1978 REPORTS OF HAIRY BEAST, NIGHT SCREAMS HAVE IOWA TOWN ON EDGE By Steven Klaus Register Assistant OTTOSEN, IA high fence, going into darkness as we passed by It was tall, about 6 feet or a little taller, black, slim and quick Instead I saw a extremely large creature walk across the road about 150 feet from me Henkins said she and a friend, Pat Young, went up to the main street to see what had frightened the girls and saw a hairy head looking out from behind one of the buildings  I remember being curious at first as to why these tracks are here, then I became very uneasy because, even though I was only 11-y/o, this didn't seem normal (a normal man has a much shorter stride) I was just about 10 to 15 min north of Sageville, IA on 52 north when to be coming around one of the curves of this winding road when I saw a dark figure in a forward lunging position running at the same time leap over the guard cable and as i was passing that very spot I could clearly see its dark shorter hair and its shoulder and upper arm as if being lifted to clear the thick bushes A SOUND WAS RECOGNIZED BY MYSELF WHICH I BELIEVE TO BE A BIGFOOT After a moment it turned and walked off with long strides into the cover  That evening, it rained, and the next day, our eperience still racing in our minds, we went back to the creek to look for footprints He said they had long swinging arms, a short neck, black hair from head to toe and they were not afraid of his presence, although he was some distance away The next day I went back and checked the road and cornfield and found large smudged footprints The creature?? Had to be maybe six and a half to seven and a half foot tall (guessing) and was bent over, was black and walking faster than we had ever seen a human walk One of the creatures was taller at about 7 feet and the second was about a foot shorter  They beat it back home when they spotted a figure five feet tall standing in front of a vacant lumber building  I thought that it was my cousin's brother trying to scare us, as he is very tall The creature, whatever it was, fled into the darkness outside her farm home three miles northwest of here  Now he said look at these footprints, as it waded out of the pool and was leaving, it's prints became clearer and clearer  As I was glancing I saw something out of the corner of my eye, at first glance I thought that it was a deer, but upon closer inspection, It appeared to be a tall man - A fortnight ago Anna Dodrill froze with fear when she looked up from a load of dishes into the ""burning red eyes"" of a big-nosed, black-faced, hairy-headed creature staring at her through a window a few feet away I even counted the number of toes, 5 on each foot and it look just like a human footprint only much larger! The prints were about 6 to 8 inches wide and about 18 to 24 inches long The new sign reads ""Big Foot Country."" A letter received last week at the post office was addressed to ""Bigfoot Country."" Then there was the fellow who walked into the post office wearing a monkey mask Here is my written account of the four Bigfoot sightings I told you about on the phone  The snow at the top of the hill where I found the tracks was packed (approximately 3-inches in depth) but the tracks went in almost completely to the ground!  I stepped off between the tracks, and it took me three full strides to go from one track to another!  You could see perfectly the outline of the foot, the toes, and the heel Her brother, who earlier that evening thought he had seen a large and hairy arm reach out from behind a cattle shed, sat at a table with a rifle ready It probably stood 2 foot taller than a deer or human I was going down the trail and the deer was coming in the opposite direction about a hundred feet over to my left My first of two encounters with a Bigfoot occurred in Eldridge Iowa during the first two weeks of February 1981 asked.so i shined the light across the river which was about 150 feet from us.I started to shining the light at the river edge slowly lifting it into the low overhanging limbs .then i seen them big red .i replyed to S.W When we got there the girl I was with and I decided to take a blanket and place it on a flat spot about 20 or 30 feet from the edge of the parking lot overlooking the river A large brownish creature, very tall, was first heard and then seen to run across the road, down the ditch and the leap over a fence and run off into a cornfield The Bigfoot sighting in Buchanan County Iowa 2006 is about 30 to 50 miles northwest from an area that I hunt just west of Maquoketa Iowa form heel mark to other foot front,  and the footprints pointed outward as it walked up on the sand ledge and then entered small willows growing in the lower parts of the big pit He described it as about 7 feet tall and covered with black hair  My hair stood up on the back of my neck and I made a bee-line for my bed, where I covered up from head to toe Just like many of you who have seen, heard or found Bigfoot and its tracks, I too have been made fun of and laughed at when I have told friends or family members of my Bigfoot encounters im wondering if its hair is hollow like a deers hair? i honestly was completely shocked and all the hair on my body rose to attention As he approached the structure a tall creature with black hair jumped up and ran out the door The next morning I arrived back at the same location at about 5:30 am and to my shocking surprise there was a new set of tracks in the snow following the original set in reverse! Now I was really scared, my first thought was I have to get the heck out of here; my second thought was this thing is following!!! You see the path that this Bigfoot took paralleled my newspaper rout and I lived across the street from the park were it stepped over the fence It just walked like a human taking long strides and swinging its arms  My husband said he doesn't want to look like an idiot and hear the jokes so he is not going to ask around about it and he isn't sure he would say it was a sasquatch because he has never thought they existed but he cant think of anything else that does exist that it looked like unless a super fast man in a big white hairy suit, with the grace and quiet of a ballet dancer was running through the woods He described it as standing about 7 feet tall and covered with black hair  Just two legs and running upright ""It was just before dark and I was driving past an old deserted farmyard when I saw it,"" Mrs a 5-6 foot stride, deeply impressed into soil This was a large bipedal animal, very unlikely to be a person, this time of night without a light (although we were fishing without a light source also) I remember running the paper up to the front door and tossing it just a little to hard, it hit the front door with a bang, as soon as it hit the door the noise must have startled the Bigfoot because it let out a horrifying scream! It was just around the corner of the house, between the house I just delivered to and the house next door and behind it just were I couldn’t see it it appeared to approx 6ft tall and well built upper body and very thick muscular legs  We did not find any down there, but while riding on another section of the property, we found what appeared to be very large footprints, resembling a human foot, only much longer and wider and deeper It had barrel shaped body with long arms and legs I left pretty spooked cursing the fact I had an slr camera with video capabilities, but being totally alone freaked me out In the water and all around were frog legs whatever it was pocked the froggs up by the legs, ate off the head and torso & threw the legs down Do you know what it is like to have the hair satand up on the nape of your neck and can't see the reason why?  E.W It saw me at a distance of about three hundred feet and when it saw me it kind of hunkered down To this day I am still haunted by the sound of the footsteps and the screech The legs I remember bent back The creature’s description: •	Covered in reddish-brown hair •	Not much of a neck, head sunk into shoulders •	Hands came to or below its knees •	About 7 feet tall, weight about 500 pounds •	“Looked like an ape type thing” •	Had an ape/human like face The witnesses did not submit a written report but I have spoken to the husband twice by phone about the incident  It was on two legs and very fast  In order to get to the country club by foot there are two sets of railroad tracks seperated by approximately 150-yards that you need to cross It's eyes reflected yellow in my headlights like a cat's Stories about a ""four legged, black haired thing in the cornfield"" began circulating after Herb Peiffer saw it in his tractor lights while driving to his turkey pens it was probally a bear eyes Then the limbs started moving and the eyes started dropping down closer to the rivers edge, and then you could see a large body, I said its probably a bear riding my bike loaded with newspapers when I looked down and saw this trail of very large footprints in the snow What she saw that night may have been Bigfoot, the beast rumored since July to be responsible for eerie night screams, broken fences, stampeded cattle, chewed-up cats, mangled rabbits and the death of a dog whose neck had been broken while it was chained near the home of its master  Seeming to be in no hurry it walked across the road and disappeared behind the tall shrubs that lined my neighbors driveway About ten minutes later, I went outside, and I saw something that looked very large and hairy moving in the shadows in my barn The first four toes were in line except for the little to which set back about 1 inch and in the fresh mud you could see hair markings around the outside of the foot My brother let off gas, as we rolled on we all watched as the creature never broke stride steped over a fence at least 40 in He said it gave him the ‘willy’s’ and he said, he got out of there as fast as possible! I haven’t seen any evidence of any Bigfoot activity in the area that I hunt but I have my suspicions being that it is only a short walking distance in Bigfoot terms from the Buchanan County 2006 sighting location He saw a shadow move across outside, and our window is about 9 foot off the ground on the second story It stood approximately 7 feet tall, had medium to dark brown hair covering its entire body, and was walking upright It was sollid black, covered in hair, and was running away from me at an incredible speed We had just crested a hill and I observed in the distance 1/2 mile ahead what appeared to be a dark upright figure walking along the north (right) side of the road on the gravel shoulder heading west up hill It was big at least 8 ft tall covered from coned head to feet with dark brown hair   I HAVE EARLIER REPORTED A BIGFOOT SIGHTING SEVERAL YRS AGO The creature's eyes bored in on Dodrill  Even if the sun had distorted them, it couldn't distort the stride or the depth Both feet were off the ground This is an old report, but recently after watching the better bigfoot programs on tv, it dawned on me that what we had experienced was a bigfoot It had to have been at least 7 or 8 feet tall in order for me to see its entire upper body over the grass From what I could see of htis animal, when standing on land it would have been seven foot tall, and a quick estimate of it's wieght around four to five hundred pounds There, in addition to stories of mutilated animals, residents talk of being awakened by eerie screams in the night; of strange footprints two-hands wide by three-hands long; of unusual feces found in Marilyn Schmacher's lean-to; and of children so terrified by what they saw that they cannot sleep and who for days wouldn't walk the town's streets - even in the daytime It had goldish eyes that reflected light like a deer's The two people in front were not paying attention as me and the other person saw cross the road a very big black hairy animal  However, this still doesn't explain to me how or why there were bare footprints with such a long stride in the snow A few days later my brother who farms with me was driving a tractor home from the fields very late at night  The footsteps ran into the trees  As I got to the top of the hill, I noticed footprints (not bootprints) in the snow going across the crest running North to South The fourth encounter was about 5 days after the third encounter and the bigfoot was walking through one of our old knocked down barns and I was out on my porch just watching him and he looked at me then he ran off and hurdled a five foot barbwire fence Newell said the creature was between six and seven feet tall, had black hair and walked quite fast on its hind legs But upon comparison to his foot was very large, and the stride it had taken was very large un reproducable for my father who was 5-11""   I started slowing down and maybe 75 yrds behind them a very large bipedal object was running behind them there were massive amounts of leaves in its very long brownish hair which covered it head to toe including the face This incident involved hearing and smelling what my brothers and I can only describe as Bigfoot Many in the area believe the creature - or creatures - is Bigfoot, a legendary, nocturnal primate that has been reported throughout history as occupying a position between ape and man STRANGE FOOTPRINTS But the humor is checked by the stories related by those who gather at Twig's Grocery Store here My girlfriend and i were camping on the Wapsipinicon river near Hwy 61,we were having a great time and decided to turn in,after about 15 minutes,out of nowhere came an incredible primal scream,the loudest thing i've ever heard,i was raised in the remote woods of the State of Maine,i've heard everything there is to hear in the woods,wolves killing deer,bears that were shot,rabid animals ect ect,iv'e heard cattle being slaughtered,wounded moose,honestly pretty much everything.As i kid i often went camping by myself for several days in the wilderness,i was too young to be scared and all i ever had was a single shot .22 rifle,i am not a stanger to the wilds,this is what im trying to stress,i was a little Jeramiah Johnson,lol,or so i thought.This scream was like nothing i've ever heard,but in Iowa?I do not tell any about this,only my ex knows the reality of the situation{we are still friends and she will verify}.It was so close to us i could judge the height that the animal was,between 7-9 feet of the ground,it was so loud it literally went ""right through us""I was so frightened that i would not leave the tent.Im not writing this because i want attention, on the contrary.About 6 months after this happened my girlfriend and i were watching a show on bigfoot,the primal scream that was played{from a recording in Oregon} on the show literally made the hairs stand up on our necks,imagine that scream at less than 20 yards from you in the middle of the night and you can try to begin the magnitude of this event.I now feel very fortunate to have been this close and had such an encounter,i have been back in this area many times but never seen tracks or heard anything,but i walk a little slower and a whole lot more alert.I am a experienced Turkey,Deer,Bear and small game hunter{i dont hunt anymore} i just want to stress my expertese in the woods,what we heard was as real as it gets. The face was sort of dog like but it was hard to see it real good in detail because it was dark and a quick look He looked out the bedroom window toward the barn, located about 35 feet south of the house and illuminated by the yard lights  He said he got a weird feeling because it was just so odd and he had our son sit down and he loaded his gun and went to see if he could see anything at all of it or foot prints to indicate what it was HOAX There are those who adamantly disagree with the Bigfoot theory and explain the sightings as either an elaborate hoax or the figment of fertile imaginations when the tracks came to a four-foot high fence on the other side of the park you could see that the creature just stepped over it like it wasn’t ever there! I followed the tracks all the way back to the City of Eldridge sewer treatment ponds were I usually hunted rabbits"
Kansas,"One Saturday evening at about 6:30 PM in October, a friend and I where walking along the Ninascah river and saw eight to ten very large foot prints in the sand 5'7"" to 6'0"" covered with short, black , hair or fur I estimate its stride at about 5 or 6 feet at a liesurely gate It suddenly raise to it hinded legs Judging by his clearing the fence in one stride he had to be at least 7 1/2 to 8 feet tall, very wide at the shoulders and you could make out a butt on him as the hair was all wet and stringy like I have always joked that it was bigfoot never knowing that there had been sightings in Kansas. When Kenny stood by the branch it was a full two and a half feet above his head!! Kenny was about 5’7” at that time, so I estimated what we saw was a little over seven feet tall The creature I seen was tall and hairy but not long hair as I had always assumed it was, color was more brown than black, I never seen its face so I am not sure of facial looks, but large head, very long arms,and very fast.  I was very excited, as I had just started reading again about bigfoot, so I took a couple of photos (attached to the document)   There was hair covering on the chest area but much more sparse It was at least 8-9 foot tall (by measure of the trees in the field and quite large  This was the only footprint noted, with good reason--the leaf litter on the trails was extensive Of all the pictures I have seen of Bigfoot, there is only 1 that is true The bigfoot went over a barbed wire fence without much effort and disappeared into a field His arms had to be at least 24 inches round or bigger cause he was big not skinny at the waist Chetopa, Kansas Chief of police measures footprints One other thing visually, the eyes appeared to be red and almost glowed red on their own and not as reflection might produce It seemed to be uniformly porportionate with the arms being the only exception and that was minor I never gave much thought to bigfoot, especially living in Kansas  The more I looked at the footprint, I noticed how flat the sole was and how even the toes were  It was after dark and was in the Spring of 2003  I did make them squat to see if they did it flat footed- ha!  I also take them to the river whenever we go for walks It was totally guttural  I am the LAST person who would want to see a real-life Bigfoot I am not sure what I seen that night but it was very large, my husband is over 6 ft and 350lbs, and it was definitely larger than him, but the classic stories of being super hairy does not match what I seen  The first photo is just a overhead pic, the second photo has my size 12 shoe lined up at the base to show how long the footprint was After we encountered this, I stopped my vehicle, in the road to only our surprise, on the East side of the road were another set of red eyes looking right at us  It was covered in a brown hair/fur Anyhow, as we were walking though these hills, I came upon a large footprint, which I would estimate to be at least 18 inches long and 7 inches wide The sound was a bit behind me and up in the air about 7 feet  Its face was shaped like a human's, although covered with hair, and its nose was not large (like a dogs's would be); he could not see visible ears  It was bent over at the waist and had long hair which was hanging down off its back and arms/legs and was soaking wet It was maybe 9 or 10 feet tall I walked about 20 feet and came out into a small clearing Big legs to his ankles and his arms were bigger than most body builders  I told Stacey the friend of mine and she looked and seen some red eyes looking at us I could see his eyes very clearly  It's arms were too long for it to be a human and it's gait was more like a human's than a primate (which would walk with knees bent & legs open), although he only observed it walking sideways She never saw the creature, but her companion saw a creature on two feet from about 20 feet away as it came out of the tree line I did not stop to look around for any others, but I did realize that it was very peculiar for anyone to be walking around barefoot a mile from nowhere along ground that would quickly cut your foot John Mark Breeze, while returning from jogging around 10:30 p.m., heard a noise in the bushes, ran up the hill to his house, turned around and saw a bigfoot running along the road When I looked up the thing had jumped the creek in front of me about 10 feet and was running through the trees are was knocking the small trees aside as he ran away screaming the whole time The sheer size of the print led me to immediately believe it was none other than bigfoot. When I saw it, the Patterson/Gimlin footage came to mind, and I was left to belive I saw Bigfoot It appeared to have the shape and look of a person but very tall,muscular and covered in what looked to be brown fur,simular to the color of the fur of a deer I came to a complete stop being only 20? feet away from this creature With lights on we knew the footsteps were about to be right through our beam of light This creature looks like a man, has eyes like a man and even if I would have had a gun, I would never shot it for fear that it would have been a man (a tall one) in some sort of suit. I turned around and saw a tall creature staring at me I had gone only a few miles  when I saw movement to my right side about 50 feet ahead It made it down the creek bank in a few seconds.I was to afraid to look for footprints as i was by myself  It had a full body of dark blonde/light brown hair, about 6'6"" or taller, and had a slight slouch to itself But, I know what happened and I did see bigfoot in Kansas He was 100-150 feet West of me standing on the bank beside a tree Visually, the creatures form was maybe 7 feet, hair covering the body, not being short like fur but generally 2-3 inches on most of the body The river runs along the entire east side of this installation and it is really thick flooded timber and lowlands John said the creature was between 6-8 feet tall, had a 3 foot shoulder span, no neck, and dangling arms.  I did wonder if anyone else saw the bigfoot as all the right lane cars were going pretty slow  It was squatting with its back towards me the whole time, it never looked back at me, and I didn't move until I turned and left to go home to try to get my phone to take a picture (which it was dark by the time I got home and there was nothing there when I got back)  After the show aired I told my family about what I saw, now he might go for a walk with me!  I didn't think about reporting this to your site until Finding Bigfoot came to the very river I saw one at, and it clicked that Matt was the head of the BFRO and you might want to hear about this incident Hairy but it was whitish grey From the hedgerow which runs alongside our road, we started hearing footsteps of Topeka, KS, a man saw a very hairy man that scared him so bad he drove through a yard and hit a clothesline. To my eyes he was beautiful -- strong, had big legs, like a dark grey feet with black around his ankles and dark dark brown with hues of reddish at the tips of his hair I found myself on duty at the CAC with another MP we called JJ he told me about how an MP Officer had seen some big hairy thing along the river banks just a few days earlier, The officer was scared spitless according to JJ's story  I saw what I thought was a large wet dog with very long dark hair, running in the ditch but kind of loping along It was grayish white and about 8 ft tall  I couldn't say for sure how tall it was, but it seemed younger, probably 6+ foot or 7 foot tall, but I'd have to have someone help me determine how big it really was  Ben stood frozen, realizing that this was neither a child nor a dog, as the thing began slowly shuffling sideways away from him along the fence line (on two feet) & holding on to the fence As we pull along side of it, the animal stood upright on its back two feet, keeping its head turned away from us, and took two steps up the bank (right foot ,left foot) and then straddled a barbwire fence with his next step and then easily cleared the fence with his left foot and disappeared into the tree line going west After awhile the chief supposedly found what was making the tracks, which was a 6'6"" kid named Chuck Bentley, which had made some wooden footprints and had stapled them to his boots Later Deputy Dwight Posey found an track one and a half feet long, seven inches wide, and shaped like a foot It was almost like a snow shoe at the ball of the foot, It was in fresh snow and back in the heavy stuff where no one would have gone to play games  I looked up and saw something standing there, then immediately take off, and without much of a start jump about 7 to ten feet in distance over a fallen tree which was about five feet high I looked up and saw somehting running upright manlike all hairy, about 5 feet tall but it was going so fast it was to the trees & gone by the time my eyes had focused I don’t really know if what we saw was really a bigfoot but we both still agreed it was something we would never forget He had hair around him and covering his face and his entire body Right away I knew that the tracks where not human, they had to belong to bigfoot The hills themselves are composed of clay with broken shale serving as small spines sticking out from the surface, not a place you want to walk barefoot through, which I have, only to have my feet sliced open time and time again We looked around for footprints but it had rained - if there were any before they had been washed away Ben described it as about 3 to 3 1/2 feet tall, covered with white or light gray hair, with a darker (gray), triangular patch of fur on its chest Although I, nor my boys have actually seen a bigfoot, they have seen strong evidence of one With each footstep we heard the crushing of leaves and twigs being broken  It had long arms, and it squatted flat footed, which I thought would be a difficult position to hold, as I squat with my heels up off the ground The figure was darkish-brown in color and it appeared to be very large in size  This animal was gigantic, when it ran into the ditch it still looked taller than my car which is a 2009 Dodge Caliber  I did check out the road that night but never thought to look for footprints the next day;  probably from fear of what I would find!!!! NOTE: After researching this further I found that the facts of this kid being related to this footprints was probable not true I stopped my car and just starred at it as it did me, then it took off and jumped the road in two large strides We would stay about 30 min., and still make it home before dark When he stood up he was at least 1 foot higher than the corn which had to be about 8 feet plus My son said he could hear Ben yelling & cussing but only between steps, as the walkie-talkie apparently lost reception each time Bs foot came down It was down on the bank behind tall grass but we knew it was looking right at us when it did it  It's hands were shaped more like human hands, but the color was darker and the texture was kind of like gorilla/ape hands It had a very large, broad, body, no neck, large head, (larger that a human head for the size of the body) and was very dark in appearance The problem is, the eyes we saw were at least 8 to 9 feet off the ground  I took the photo because I thought it was odd that a bare human-looking footprint would be there in the mud, fairly fresh, as the nightly temperatures had been near or at freezing recently, and the water/mud would have been quite cold too  We opened the door and both saw a large and dark figure standing down by the mailbox (around 1/4 of a mile from the house) and we both kind of freaked Was fishing at Ottowa county lake near Bennington happened to look over to the south by the dam and saw a huge upright creature towering above the tall grass it was right next to a tree the lowest branches on that particular tree are about 10 ft from the ground the head was right below that branch  I saw the head and shoulders of it my name is James I'm in the military and I know i saw a bigfoot. The only thing that I got out of that experience was when how tall he was I finally could tell that the thing was running away and I stood up and opened my eyes  First I thought it was a homeless person or local, but then I noticed they were covered in hair, so then I wondered why someone would be dressed in a bigfoot costume at this remote area by the river, then I looked around to see if there was anyone else filming trying to pull a hoax or something- you never know what the teenagers will do these days  The bigfoot was breaking open mussels or clams or whatever and then eating them, which made me think 'Who would eat that raw from this dirty river where there is trash laying around?' It was very tall, as he told her five years later  There are several farms to the west of the interstate along with roads cut off by the interstate and drainage ditches It was so loud that I crouched down and covered my ears and I had my eyes closed I believe it must have been 7-8 feet tall  The most memorable feature was the eyes....they were very black  I had walked over a pile of dead and chopped wood into the woods about fifty feet when I heard something ahead  It was really fuzzy, especially in the face and it had dark sunken eyes and a mouth that was not visible and the nose was not distinct I conceal myself in some tall brushes along the side of the water, on the East side There was only one print and it had been made in the soft mud of one of the small frog ponds, as if whatever had left it casually walked by and stepped one foot into softer ground  The fur was about six plus inches long and had a weird pattern, I only say this because I am a cosmotoligist and hair growth pattern matters He was very tall at least 7 feet and built very athletically Neither of us spoke to anyone else about it but both of us were convinced we had seen a “bigfoot” It looked like a human being with hair all over him The slag heaps undulate as they go, rising upwards near twenty-five feet and then dropping back down again like a series of small hills The night was very dark and although they had a flashlight, all it would reveal was the immediate brush along the creek   I think it might have been a bigfoot. I know bigfoot exist's and have tried for years to prove it as my first experience was when I was a kid It continued for a few steps, stopped and looked at me again and then strode with long strides toward the trees I was about 125 yards away from them on a sand bar when I looked to the west of me and saw a large dark hairy figure in the water splashing itself as if where bathing  It sounded just like some of the high pitched sounds made on finding bigfoot  At this point she said she saw three images the first sighting for her he was on all 4 appendages the second time he was on two legs and the last time he was at the window I said was it about 5 feet tall & reddish haired This thing was over 7' tall We stopped several times to listen, but when we did the footsteps stopped It was on two legs but when it approached the ditch it used its front hands/paws for leverage I never saw this thing but we did see foot prints one evening down along the river I never thought much about what I heard until I heard some of the sounds made by the finding bigfoot crew When we left that night, it was nearly total darkness along the little road My wife couldn't take her eyes off of two red eyes staring at us through some trees off to the West of the road When he stood up my sister said ""What was that?""   I told her that was a bigfoot To me it looked like a big bear in the water but I remember its arms were way to long. He wouldn't say it but it was a Bigfoot I told my sister that I thought I had hit a person, she asked if it was a deer? I said no it was upright and well over 6 ft tall The fur or hair was long in some spots but shorter around the face and eyes"
Kentucky,"In summary, whatever I saw was 6-6.5 feet tall, dark brown to black fur, bipedal posture, angry demeanor  Both creatures were covered with white, and somewhat curly, hair all over He had hair much like a chimps hair grows on its arms and legs It had a back that was at least 2.5 feet across and covered in short, thick reddish brown hair  I asked her how big and she said the biggest one was a lot bigger than me (I'm 6'4"" 200lbs) and it was real hairy It walked on two legs, and very well I might add, it seemed very graceful It rolled off into the darkness and found its resting spot  There on the side of the road in the edge of the woods was a bigfoot and sort of foggy,we were just driving along when my cousin noticed two red eyes on a bank It was kind of shiny, like greasy hair, at least it appeared that way in what light was left More soft evidence was discovered, as Tumey found long white hairs on the door knob of the freezer But I promise you that thing was 7 to 9 ft tall and as wide as 2 men standing shoulder to shoulder The creature was on my side and as the car passed it, I couldn't have been more than 2 to 3 feet from it's body It was between 7 and 8 feet tall and could have weighed as much as 500 pounds The creature was HUGE! I later looked at a tree it was standing near and it had to be near 7ft tall  The figure itself was not totally visible but hidden mostly behind the shadows of the larger trees behind and around it The bottom of the window is at least six feet six inches off the ground, I'am six feet and I had to use an 8 inch block to see over the bottom edge of the window The hair on the back of my neck and arms was standing straight up and goosebumps had come up all over me the nose and eyes areas was free of hair, the skin a dark grey After this incident, I started learning about bigfoot and was and still am convinced that the creature is real. As silly as it sounds, when it left my sight, I spoke aloud to this ""thing"" and said ""Old one I mean no harm and I'm only taking what I need"" all the while easing my way around and down toward my family, once I was out of eyesight I took off down the mountain as fast as I could, I could hear this ""bigfoot"" following at a distance It made my hair stand on end These footprints were not those of shoes, just feet We came across footprints very large but they stopped after a short distance It stared up the mountain at me, and made a peculiar motion with its head, waving it from side to side, and seemed to hunch over a bit with its arms dangling at it's knees  The window was long and narrow and about 4 feet from the ground  I am not a believer, I thought sightings were hoaxes before that night but now I cant explain what that was and I'm not ruling out the possibility that it could have been bigfoot. Well thanks for listening hope this helps you find the truth about bigfoot. I had never heard of bigfoot at that time, so i was sure king kong was standing outside looking through the open window It was very cold, (it was already dark as well), so he started up the car to let it warm before we took off  But the eyes were not always visible to Chuck, so I may have looked at the wrong moment i have encountered bigfoot in my area several times since then.  Since that experience, we have become very interested in the Bigfoot sightings, followings, documentaries, websites, etc  I couldnt find anything but it was cold, dark and I was shaking from the shock of seeing them and the cold combined I would like to say that I would have never thought that I would see something like this, if it was a ""Bigfoot"" or not..I know that it wasn't a bear and it wasn't anything that modern science knows about..  I waited until almost dark and got down to look for fur or prints Then I heard other foot falls paralleling us to our left We looked for foot prints or anything the next morning but all we found was where it jumped the creek and dug in to the hillside going up it Again, it happened so quickly though, I didn't get to see feet, hands or facial details like eyes and mouth When we returned to camp we reviewed the video tape and I was happy to see that we recorded the eyeshine I had not heard of markers of bigfoot territory but I saw what I thought was the work of a few of the local boys out in the woods playing What I remember is the thing was covered with off white to tan colored hair with less on it's face and stomach area There was a large manlike creature with long, shiny dark hair covering it's entire body  It was at least 10 feet tall and covered with thick black hair  It was bent over at the edge of the creek and when they came closer...it jumped up on two feet and walked quickly into the woods  This story is true because my late Grandmother, an honest woman and Christian, saw one of these ""bigfoot"" creatures on two seperate occasions both at night time  I stepped over toward him and asked him where and he said, ""Over your right shoulder."" At that point I knew there were two animals up there because the eyeshine [glowing eyes] that he was videotaping were in the opposite direction of the one I illuminated only seconds before I waited about a hour and went back out and was just standing there and heard footsteps off to the side of their house as i walked the little spilway that meets the revine i founf a very desernable footprint on the bank of it he opened his phone up and there was a perfect pic of a huge footprint and he said it was fresh they were out in the feild and heard a big crashing noise down the hill from them and they went to go see what it was and they found the prints and u can see in the others that it slid down the hill or it lost its footing Because of it’s position and it being dark out, I was not able to see the face or front of it There was a hole of water in each side of the road but in the center was mud and in the mud was a very large footprint, not a bear track, it looked like a huge human footprint about 15 to 16 inches long  And when it looked at us, it's eyes followed us as we passed I know that there is the possibility it was a bear, but what made me so uneasy is the fact that the brush and branches this thing was disturbing were 5 to 6 feet off the ground! knowing that black bears only stand around 3 feet high on all fours and knowing that bears don't move far on two legs (much less several hundred yards) I really believe what was following me down the hill was a bigfoot (there were 8 of us in the truck 3 in the cab and 5 in the bed)  We called the dogs but got no response, so we waited...about 30 to 45 mins later the dogs came running back to the truck with their tails tucked between their legs like sometings had scared them to death but from the nose, mouth, and chin were covered in hair It still raises the hair on the back of my neck to tell it and, as I just discovered, to write it down A creek ran through the area that was maybe twelve feet across and three feet deep in places It had to be tall to be stomping trough the water the way it was It turned toward me and it's eyes were large and seemed to be a reddish color Let us for a moment believe it was a prowler, rather than a hairy hominid The figure that growled at me was way taller than me, had to be at least 6-8 feet tall As we were walking off we decided to walk down an old logging path off the hill, about half down my dad says whats that there and I look and see what looks like a really big human foot print, but like really big with a prominate heel and toes with a arch in the middle of the print I was shocked because it sounded like it was no more then 50 feet away That night he drew a picture of what he saw and it looked just like some of the drawings of bigfoot that I have seen as of today There was also small trees  that were twisted almost in two at from four to six feet off the ground ( there were a total of 4 tracks (2 left and 2 right footprints) , going in a straight line right up the middle of the trail Upon arrival, we talked to the curator of the property and he advised us that an investigator from the previous night had a possible Bigfoot sighting I honestly couldn't say how tall it was, because it was standing in a ravine and was some distance from me, not to mention that it was starting to get dark, I was only ten years old, and it was 22 years ago The animal had a dark brown coat with a lighter, almost grey vest At some point I started screaming, ""Turn on your brights! There's something in the road!"" All the while, I'm looking at this thing which is very big in stature, thick legs, thick abdomen, and (again by my calculations) at least 7 ft tall  By the time I got 20 feet away, I saw a very tall figure covered in dark reddish-brown hair jump over the ditch, over a fence and take off through the field The next day which was April 15 2010, I went back to the footprint to take pictures, which i have and would love to share well it was really dark outside and i could not make a good visual of the creature but it was unlike anything i have ever seen before in my life We initially thought it could be a ""shadow figure"" of a large Civil War soldier, but the height, arm length and recent activity on the property prompted me to conclude that it was a flesh and blood Bigfoot sighting and not of a spiritual nature  It looked to have stood well over 7 feet in height This man was described as having long blonde hair and a beard On the left of a old wagon road i noticed a 17 inch footprint at the edge of the road/path I don't know how deep the water is but it looked like it was standing about four feet out of the water, and had long shaggy hair. I spotted the eyes again going out the ridgeline about 100 yards in front of me Went to get trail cams and see dark black figure close to 7 feet tall  She described the creatures as standing tall and upright, and walking like a man From time to time I'll see an animal show that will feature a three toed sloth, and every time I see a sloth I always think, ""That sloth's hair looks like that bigfoot I saw when I was a kid"" If you want, I can draw what I saw if that helps any. Also another concern of the picture i've seen of bigfoot.. The ride back to the main road seemed to take forever and the entire distance back I could hear branches breaking and what appeared to be heavy footsteps running along side me; I was terrified  I didn't scream or do anything myself but look into it's eyes I was taveling to work west bound it came from the river up over the guardrailing took two steps in crossing two lane highway looked at me then disapeared into woods happened on US460 east of Shelbiana KY greenish brownish hair 3 to 4 inches in length 7 to 8 feet tall male I will never forget it as long as I live At around 3 in the morning, another ear-piercing scream not ten feet away from our campsite echoed off the trees I told him that I was a little over 5’ and told him to guess a size in feet and he said around 5’.   The other man from Florida said, ( you know what that looks like? ) no one said anything, so he went on and said  ( that's one of them Bigfoot prints ) I almost fell off my 4 wheeler, I said (do you really think so?)  he said (sure , if you hunt as much as we do back in Florida, its not unusual to see them on occasion)  I can't begin to tell you how relieved I was to hear them say this, as I have always been very discreet with my belief in Bigfoot's existence, and as a Pastor/Minister you have to be so careful around people   Our farm was surrounded by neighboring farms, but no one lived on the land bordering ours, the owners all lived in town The height if this thing had it stood up would be at least 6.5 feet tall We were following a Ford Ranger and were probably 30-40 foot behind it Regardless, something with two legs entered our camp, in the dead of night, in pitch blackness, and left us unharmed, but fearful to look outside Then suddenly a sound came from outside of the tent in the woods...a sound of cracking and very heavy footsteps through grass There is such a thing as bigfoot i took pictures of his foot prints in the mud and i think that they should send researchers out here to look for it i believe that you will find it actually i promise you will find it.   Very hairy around the genital area so one could not tell if he was male or female....but I didn't see any breasts so I judged it to be male It was really dark so I couldn't really see very well I still remember that day like it was yesterday because of the fright in my brothers eyes when he came out of the woods that day and where its head was, using the pine tree for scale, I measured ten feet 2 inch tall there was one foot print in the yard I didn't have any casting supplies so I took a picture of it and measured the foot print at 17 inches  I knew immediately what I was seeing from the many Bigfoot tracks I have seen on web-sites, from books, and even TV programs, but I didn't know what to say, so I waited We held the light up on the hill about 100 feet away for awhile all we heard was one constant sounds in the leaves right in front of us as something else walked around to the right of us  His chest seemed to be pretty hairless Chuck [one of the witnesses] continued videotaping the eyes and reacting to what he was seeing through the camera OK, let me start by saying I have always been fascinated by ""Big Foot.""  I don't think it makes me biased because until recently I was always still skeptical but very curious I saw it take 3 steps then my hair stood on end and I ran back to our house  We had only made it about 100 to 200 feet when the driver of the truck slammed on the brakes ( we weren't going fast ) I was in the back of the truck not knowing what was going on..I looked into the back glass and saw the 3 in the front of the truck pointing up ahead of us so we ( the people in the back ) stood up and looked, what we saw was huge, standing about 7 1/2 to 8 feet tall, the color was hard to tell with the shadows but I would say it was either black or dark brown I was walking home and I think I saw bigfoot He saw what looked like a large dark man-like entity running towards the woods My grandpa drove a school bus and at about 5;30-6;00 one morning he said that what he thought was a big man with shaggy matted reddish brown hair came out of the woods and stepped up on the road in front of the bus and ran across the road Police reports show that they were receiving calls about a strange blonde haired man seen roaming about over the past few weeks All I could see was 2 dark things looking at me When he approached the figure, he was shocked to see a 6-7 foot tall ""ape-like"" creature with white hair  I dismissed it as a childs imagination but always kept it in mind because the description matched stories I had heard as a teenager about a big foot type creature in Lawrenceburg known as ""Howdy"" because he waves Anyways us boys all went down to where he said he seen the thing and we notice large footprints just noticable to the eye because it was so dry but there was a little spring running in the middle of the woods and there where some soft ground that the footprints where made in  Needless to say not a one of us dared head out that next morning in the darkness for any deer hunting  Just after dark, I was sitting inside, reading a book, when I heard what sounded like two logs being hit against one another...making a loud, hollow “knocking” noise It had long arms that appeared to hang as far down as it's knees, and they swung as it walked I looked down the hill about 12 feet away when it jolted across the clearing  If was about 8ft tall and i would say about 450 pounds When the light went on,""IT"" took off on two legs and busted branches as it went The biggest of the 2 looked to be around 7 ft to the eyes  The creatures just got up and walked away on two feet just like a person would do back into the woods A few years ago.Me and my wife was going ginseng hunting.Back in the woods behind our home.It was starting to get warm out the sun was up.We started over the hill top.And the under brush started to get thicker.but we went on.my wife started looking down in this wash out (ditch) I was going along the top of this wash out.(the wash out or ditch mind you was about 12 foot deep and about 20 wide and goes all the way down this hill about 300 feet)We were just going along looking.I heard some noises coming from across the ditch.about 20 to 30 feet away.I tought it might have been a deer or something .I kept on looking in the way the noise was coming.The noise was trees and brush slapping togehter.I seen some brush moving around.then it stop.I was looking trying to see what was making the noises.thats when it came into my view.there was.this thing with redish brown hair.alover at least the parts I seen.I only seen from the chest up.I was only 20 - 30 feet away from it I could see its dark eyes,face,everything.It looked like a man to me.My wife was still down in the wash out.I could see her.I watch this thing.look down at her then back at me.I had a loaded.22 rifle with me but I could not bring the gun up.It watch us for a few minutes.then I got up enough nerve.To tell my wife to head back up the hill.We was only there about 20 minutes she ask me why are we leaving so fast?.I told her to just get up the hill.But go slow .I didnt know if it would come after us.If we took off running.I watched as she went up the hill.I was walking backwards.Trying to see where it was.and what is was doing.i seen its chest thru the brush As we headed up the hill.thats when my wife seen it to.She started to run.But I got her to stop.We made it home.We have had dogs missing.Only to find them later on tore apart.There insides tore out.This pass deer season (2004).I was back behind my house.hunting I started up the hill.across from where I and my wife seen (Bigfoot).I had a big rock thrown.at me .The rock hit in the top of a big tree.I watched it bounce.off the tree.and hit the ground .I put up my gun looking thru my scope I couldnt seen anything.It was cold on this day I couldn't figure how someone could only leave one footprint and why they weren't wearing shoes It was huge it's color was very light white/brown it's arms was at it's knees and I was not the only one who seen it that year our county sheriff seen it at his house as well I know the sheriff very well and I know he would not lie about somthing like this he tracked it for about a mile behind his house and found some of it's hair on his fence So I got on the internet that night looking at some bigfoot stuff, i had watch some already and i believed in bigfoot but never really thought i would experience it in my own back yard It was at that time that I stopped dead in my tracks, because right in front of me was the biggest foot print I'd ever seen Why was my neighbor wearing white? How did he know we were out here tonight?  Why was he standing so still and how the hell did he get so tall?  We, meaning ""it"" and I, stared at each other for several seconds  I sat down and then heard a loud grunting sound about 20 feet behind me It's hair was extremely dark not the length of a ape look but it was longer and very stringy looking  This thing had to have been at least 8 feet tall  It was dark in color, guessing dark brown or black, with a thick furry outline It looked like a giant hair covered man with no neck My uncle was the first to crack a joke, ""they sure do grown them big around these parts."" They were forced to admit that it was an extremely large footprint, in fact, it easily doubled my step dad's size 10 1/2 foot  They were both jogging with arms relaxed and looking behind them I couldnt make out any facial features and the creature made no sounds even when I shouted bigfoot and the 4 of us ran directly to the south out of the woods which was around 300 yrds  Both of our sightings were tall creatures and off white. He described the creature's gait as having large strides, but it appeared as moving at a slow speed, as if he (C.F.) could catch up with it There were no campfires allowed in the area we were in, so it got dark fairly quick i turned on the lights i seen this big thing standing behind the gravel pile with one hand proped up on it and leaning over it with its big eyes and it had really long blackish brown hair  I thought they may be older ones of these creatures because of the white hair  But then I realize...wait...this is walking on only TWO FEET I stopped about 10 feet past where it crossed in front of me I was standing in my front doorway changing a light bulb and I heard a popping/cracking sound that I had never heard before I looked down and both of my cats were running up the sidewalk to me maybe a minute after I looked up across the highway behind my mailbox and there was  something about 7 to 8 feet tall just walking by calm as could be 8 feet tall and had long brown hair all over it All I can say is that it was covered with dark hair all over We knew we weren't crazy because the dog would sit there stock still and give one of those low throaty growls that would make a person freeze if you heard it in the dark The figure was at least 7-8 feet tall and covered in thick black hair, couldn't guess the weight, but it was big  I turned to look and  couldnt believe my eyes Listening to the HOWL.WAV of the Ohio Bigfoot struck a real responsive chord was the last one to leave the wood that day when he came running back screaming that he had just seen a hairy monster Anyway, I just mustered up the courage to go where I thought the sound came from and there were foot prints - very large and they looked like they had two big toes The arms were longer than a humans and the strength was demonstrated when it shoved the tree And an adult would know and expect people to have firearms About five minutes later, I heard the same noise, maybe fifty or seventy five feet down the hill in the direction of the clearing  Trust me, this eerie sound would make your hair stand on end, and this was no ordinary animal sound either  It had just started to turn dark in the evening, when my husband came in from outside and all he said was ""Do you want to hear that sound ?""    He didn't have to say anymore A hitching post was located to the side of this barn about 3 feet high  We looked in awe at this track until we heard sticks breaking, this scared us..so we jumped in the truck and flew away...we stopped a few miles away..we had a flat tire, while changing the tire we all wanted to go back and see if we could see this thing again....So after we changed the tire we headed back...we stopped the truck right before the place we saw the footprint..we got out and looked and you could barely see it. The hair was about 2.5 to 3 inches long, black and shiny And it appeared to be holding its arms/paws up at shoulder height, as though it were a tree, or stiking some pose intended to frighten me, which was very effective When I looked in front of us I didn't see the eyes he was talking about, so I was trying to deny it in my mind  My friend, who still lives  in the area, says that he has heard the sound on two other occasions since then, but I never heard anything like it again;  that is, until  I downloaded some possible Bigfoot sounds recorded in Ohio, and that is EXACTLY the sound we heard that night He was, I judge about 6 feet tall When he peered out the front door, he saw a white, hairy creature with pink eyes that must have weighed about 400 pounds and was about 7 feet tall Remember I was 12 or 13 and we didn't know much about bigfoot or such I am telling you guys this was no deer I saw it take 3 step, it was tall and it was dark colored 2 sets of red/ orange colored eyes was looking at me no more then 50 yards away It was almost out of the range of his headlights, and by my calculations, about 75-100 feet away from us This was in a small, lower middle-class community that was not quite suburbs, not quite farms The face of the one I saw was covered with hair and the eyes were big and round  It was still too dark to see but I assumed it was a severely spooked deer because it sounded large and it was loud This point I was getting really nervous, so I took the safety off on the gun and said (""if you are a person you better leave, if your a bigfoot then you better not growl or howl our push any harder on the blind cause I'm gonna start blowing holes in something"" I saw a white colored bipedal animal, it looked to be around or over 7 feet tall, broad shoulders, and thick coarse hair draping off of the creature So I did a howl and got no response i stood on my porch for about 10 minutes and figured if there was a bigfoot in the area it probably moved on by then What I saw was still creates goose bumps on my arms Hair was like sloth fur I knew that whatever was responsible for the odor, it  had to be very close, because my eyes were beginning to tear up When we arived we noticed that what apeared to be a small bare footed child had walked across the ice before it had fully frozen The first one was scary and all (had a rock thrown at my dads truck and made a huge crash in the dark) but this one has basically scared me away from my parents house at night! This was right before Christmas and we had record high temps close to 70 so I was hanging out on their front porch It was about 7 feet tall, big legs, small upper body with thin longer hair on chest and arms, short neck and short thick hair on legs, dark brown in color My husband has always thought there was “something” out there...and has never doubted the existence of Bigfoot  This was a open field, bright sunshine lit day, nothing between us and the animal, so we got a good look but not a very long look at bigfoot I’m guessing that the truck is between 5’ and 6’ tall This made the hair stand up on the back of your neck. I'm guessing the hair was about 3 inches long and the color looked like copper in the bright light It seemed to be thin and tall It stood up like a man, but it was so dark, about all I could see was a huge shadow It swayed left 3 times, paused; then sway 2-3 times to the right and stop.Since we weren't using our flashlights, our eyes were very attuned to the darkness.The figure was around 7 feet plus in height, the 1/2 of a large head, shoulder and arms that were past the knees.This activity continued foe a few minutes, to the point that I asked my fellow investigator if he was seeing what I was seeing the gate isnt but a few feet away from the neighbors house We were videotaping this rock formation in the dark with the Sony nite-shot and talking as it got darker Eyes were glowing red..........eerie..... I saw it and it saw me, our eyes met and he stepped out from behind the tree I ran inside but watched through the open door it kept watching me, then in 3 large steps was across the road and faded into the darkness I had been hearing this odd ""tapping"" noise all the while, and saw this dark brownish figure near a log close to the thicket some 250 yards away (I have a hard time determining distance, so it could more or less) At first I thought it a rare sighting of a black bear, but when I looked at it through the bin's, I couldn't believe what I saw We got set up, and were sitting outside the tent while it got dark  When his dogs gave chase to the creature, tall and upright like a man with brown hair all over, just leaped over the fence and walked away into the valley below  The nose I didn't notice maybe the hair covered it or I don't remember it anyway Problem was this thing looked to be about 7 or 8 feet tall, as it's head was into the branches Just before I could scream out, ""DEER IN THE ROAD!"" the creature began to walk very quickly, and at that moment I realized it had two legs, not four  It's face was what startled me the most because it had human like features especially the eyes..not like any animals' eyes i'd ever seen before (and I've been a hunter all of my life) The track had a definite form a heel, front pad and five toes .It had crossed a distance of about twenty feet in six steps went up a steep bank slipped down and went on up the bank Again no more then 50 feet away Our house was built into the hillside.The front yard dropped off 200 feet to the road below, then dropped again to a small creek Evidently, it had been standing there for the minute or so  I studied the footprint, and had been watching me I said look for tracks, none found, so we checked out the x and my friend found a hair on the x marker It had a very short neck and arms that reached nearly to the knees In fact, I have yet to see a black bear walk on two legs at all, I've seen them stand up, but not walk I was carring my sony hi8 camcorder because i have seen bigfoot before but it had been awhile With very distinctive muscle tone definition in it's legs and arms, this thing looked very strong We went back home and she pulled the hair out of her pocket so we could check it out We had just got to a deep spot so he was trying to make sure he didnt drown it out i glanced to the left and thought i seen somthing big and furry standing in the  cane weeds i am 5'3 and the weeds were about 2 foot taller than me and it was about 2 foot taller than them i was about 15 to 20 yards from it i looked back over there and hopeing it wasnt what i thought it was and it seen me and turned and hunkered down and ran off its its back was about 3ft wide and it was a light brown in color.  He thought it was a bear like most stupid people do but it ran on two feet like a human It was about 9 or 10 feet tall, it was so big it covered the entire window  There was no mistake these were big foot(s)  But make no mistake, it had the face of a man covered with hair, not the snout of a wolf The state police concluded that the hair was light brown, blonde and white - from a Caucasian  We were standing at the base looking up through the shadows of the trees when I noticed there was someone standing up on the rock (about 10 feet up)  looking back at us It was coming from a very tall and steep mountain, and when it hurried across the road, it must have gone off a very steep cliff, as that is the only place it could have gone Although my friend is hesitant to believe it was the big guy, she does not deny that something with two legs was walking around her that night The hands looked human, four fingers and a thumb, the skin a dark greyish color  It was no more than 15-20 feet from me, looking up at me from just below the rock formation  The bigfoot was about 50 feet in front of me on the other side of the fence line My brother was more inclined to believe my story because he and my sister had often heard what we called ""the cruncher"" while sleeping out on the screened in backporch (which is about 15 feet off the ground on the back of the house) Land has strip mines with several ponds scattered through it, there are houses, and small farms, (just family type farms) If I had to guess it was 7.5 to 8 feet tall and its stride was 6 to 7 feet long I was only 10 years old at the time and was totally oblivious to the word, bigfoot So it was forgotten until I started to check out some Bigfoot info once I moved to Seattle Washington  So right there in the middle of the trail was a set of very large foot prints,  heading along the trail, on up the mountain, but not along the path the Bear had just taken  From left to right I watched 2 creatures, both larger than me and covered in long hair, running upright on 2 feet  I believe it was looking at us but I can't say for sure because it was so dark  Knowing this thing could not possibly be my son...as the tent is several feet off the ground and something VERY large I know is there because I heard it approach out of these acres of wooods I shout ""CODY IT'S NOT TURK!!!MY GOD!!"" and the thing immeditately throws the tent down and begins to run extremely fast back against my tent which again begins to BUMP BUMP BUMP!  against the side...and then I hear it going back into the woods with the same WHOOSH Thump sound and then the sounds of cracking branches  I mostly remember the eyes As far as height, I can say that it was as tall as a few of the smaller trees it stood next to, but I don't know how tall they were either Then the bigfoot stood up and walked our way The white hairs found at the sight were forwarded to the Kentucky State Police for analysis by the crime lab They looked just like a human footprint but very big I could not make out many details, but the thing that struck me most was the long strides it took and the way it swung it's arms,very smooth and graceful I only had a short glimpse of it but, it was tall, large, hairy, and an animal of some sort at an instant a extremely tall with it's back slightly curved foreward ,very long arms and legs,lanky bodystyle , long hair covery it's body from head to it's feet came up from side of the road .One foot hit edge of the blacktop.it took no more than two and 1/2 steps till it was on the other side of the road going into the woods The arms on the creature I saw were definitely longer than those of any bear. It had a bulged forehead near the eyebrow, large round dark eyes, and a flared gorilla like nose  The feeling I got was that it was curious but confused, confused as to what we were, and what we were doing up there after dark   I looked at my friend ""Ricky"" and said (well Rick, what do you think?)  and he looked me straight in the eye and said, ( I know they exist I've seen one before )   I literally jumped off my 4 wheeler and said ( you got to be kidding me )  We then both learned that although we had been friends for all these years, we had never talked about Bigfoot to each other, and now I find out that he once saw one, needless to say I was blown away from this revelation Hair analysis can be inconclusive and it does take longer than one week to fully complete the comparison testings I still remember seeing the footprints swallowing my barefoot when I place it in it Tumey told the Flemingsburg ""TIMES DEMOCRAT"", ""It was very dark, so I really could not tell exactly what it was It was on two legs, dark in color, wide (depth of the body, from back to chest-I don’t mean the broadness of the shoulders as I saw it from the side), large legs and very tall I looked right into its eyes and face A week later, the results were back and it was determined that the hair was of human origin  At this point, my sister and I remained silent for at least 3 to 4 minutes after we first laid eyes upon it, as if we were seeing something we shouldn't be seeing Subject: Tall, white haired ""ape-like"" creature Date: November 5, 1980 @ 4:00 or 5:00 AM Witness: N NOT the fuzzy hair like a bear in front on the truck, she said it was about 9 or 10 ft tall and went in a strip of woods on the river bank is it's hair The foot steps sounded really heavy (Sort of like a hairy ninja hood) I passed within 15-20 feet of it  I remember afterwards that it was a large creature, with tanish/brown fur around 7 feet tall with an almost Neanderthal brow and flatish nose Still this day my brother swears he saw Bigfoot that day and I do believe him I have had 2 encounters in my lifetime with, what i believe to be, bigfoot/sasquatch I was watching A&E In Search Of, Bigfoot, they were audio taping trails where bigfoot was sighted The blind I have is 6 feet tall, this means he had to be at least 8 feet plus tall it was getting dusk dark and we where on the left side of the river as we were riding we had met about 6 deer that were on our side of the river and we sat and watched them with out turning off the fourwheeler  He was tall    The length of the stride was somewhere near 4 1/2  to 5 feet..... These noises haven't stopped and I have heard them every week since I've lived here for almost a year now and about 4 days ago I had a visual sighting of one about 40-50 feet away from me, they seem so very active around my house and I strongly appreciate if someone could help me in this matter. It was a bare footprint, complete with the impression of 5 toes We both went to the tree and there was nothing there that could explain the dark figure we both saw. Myself and a friend were bored one afternoon,so we decided to take his dad's small john boat and look around some creeks just a couple miles from his house.After putting in a time or two,we found one that kept going and stayed wide and deep enough to follow it for awhile.We only had paddles so we moved fairly quiet,i guess.After paddling for a few hours,and having to get out from time to time and drag the boat over beaver dams,it had became late afternoon and the sun started to go down.We had been talking and laughing the whole time,so we really weren't trying to be quiet.As we rounded a bend in the creek,we both saw a large piece of rock come flying out of the trees and land in the middle of the creek,making a big splash probably about 50 yards or so ahead of us.At the time,i was a police officer and was armed pretty much everywhere i went.That particular day we had been shooting trash like cans and bottles that we found alongside the roadway just up from where we put in at,so we were both armed.My friend immediately opened fire with warning shots in the general direction where the rocks came from, 5 or 6 shots as i was trying to turn the boat around.We normally wouldn't have freaked out like that but,it was the manner in which it occurred that scared us.The rock appeared to be bigger than anything either of us could've picked up,let alone throw like that.Another thing was,the height from which it came.Which was about 2 or 3 feet higher than i am tall from what i saw,and i am 6 foot one.Also,it was heavily wooded,flat,swampy creek bottoms so it didn't just fall from anywhere,and had the circumstances been where it could've fallen,it would'nt have landed in the middle of the creek.It would've just landed on the bank.After we got turned around and started paddling like crazy in the other back toward the truck,we didn't hear or see anything,but we still didn't waste any time.As it got darker,we started hearing footsteps up in the woods on our left.I say ""footsteps"" cause it didn't sound like any deer hooves that i had ever heard,it sounded like somebody large and heavy.When we'd stop paddling,it would stop walking.It would walk only when we paddled.This went on all the way to the point where we got close enough to the road to hear traffic going by,and it was all the way dark by then and had been for some time.Once we got to the road,we loaded up and got out of there in a hurry,not hearing anything else and very shaken.There were no houses for miles in either direction from where we parked other than my friend's house which was a few miles to the west and nothing to the east for roughly 5 miles.The property that the creek runs on is a 3000 acre tract of land that used to be a coal mine but had been shut down for several years.I tried to explain it away to myself but,it just didn't add up.I always figured,even if it had been some person large enough to throw a rock that size,they would've said something when my friend opened fire on em'.And,they sure wouldn't have followed us all the way back to the road for fear of being shot at again you would think.The swamp we were in runs across several counties, and is largely unpopulated in most parts so,who knows.  There were no foot prints so they said she probably saw her own reflection and I guess just dissmised it It had long brown hair When I got to just infront of or just a little past their house, I saw a tall black figure, walking upright, walk along that fenceline  Just behind a neighbor's house we saw a big foot digging in the ground with a stick of fire wood, at times taking one stick of fire wood and pounding a second stick into the ground Upon following the path this person must have taken, my eyes made contact with a dark figure from between 50 to 80 yards away from me on the other side of the stream We got within 20 to 30 feet of it All at once something jumped up out of the tall grass on my left side It was very tall and covered with hair radio to inform the other guards of what I had just encountered.I stayed the rest of the night in my car.The next morning when my relief showed up I informed him of what I had encountered and I looked for footprints.but the heavy rainy made it difficult to find any that would be useful I have seen eyes that looked blood red, and another time green, as they were looking at me from the low underbrush at night I never saw any footprints but once when the dogs were acting up at something in the woods, and just about twenty yards up the hill, I went after it with a 30 30 rifle  The eyes reflected the red headlamp  said that its white hair was real long - much like a horse's mane  It was very hairy looking and was making some weird grunting noises The noise started behind us to the left ,it was rustling sound that became a loud snapping and cracking that seemed to come closer ,there was a thumping sound as well this lasted maybe a couple of minutes , we stood there looking in the area expecting someone to come out into the light.My wife was visibly shaken ,but I re-assured her ""it was probably a deer"".I hoped to re-assure myself as well,encouraging her to get her line back in the water, I kept glancing back in that direction cause I knew we werent alone out there now ,as we recast our lines something ran across the gravel road behind us,the gravel scattered under its weight,into the tree line along the side of my pick-up ,as it went along side ,whatever it was ""slapped "" the truck bed ,three times quickly , then there was cracking and breaking of limbs on that side of the woods.The lanterns were glowing on the underside of the branches above as they shook and swayed the ""thumping"" was its feet on the ground,i felt it Then the foot steps continued to come closer to the blind He also stated that the creature was ""man-like"", except that those eyes were like that of an animal I estimated later it was near 8' tall, I'm also a carpenter and pretty good at measurements  When I got up there and looked over the side, my red headlamp lit up a sasquatch standing 15-20 feet away He described the feces as loose, with grass and long, black hairs in it Then as I happened to look back behind me from the hollow I came out of on the far side of that ridge I saw a very large dark hair covered figure that was watching me and it was standing upright, it definately was not a bear A very tall, hairy creature was standing by the hitching post to the right of the barn I wish I could tell you that I saw a Bigfoot We did not find anything, it was dark and hard to tell in what direction the noise was coming from I think I seen a mom and a baby bigfoot As we walked in the dark I could clearly hear something else walking, following us down the hill  I have studied bigfoot ever since i could read I almost hit it, missed it less than a foot It was pitch dark at about 9:30 ,but the lanterns kept the area well lit almost back to our pick-up it was parked back behind us about 75 or 100 ft When he came around the curve there was a big thing that looked like a man and ape with matted patchy red/brown hair like it had been burned or something running down the path so he hit the brakes and the thing ran across the road and down the other path Then, out of the thicket stepped something, walking on two legs, black from head to toe, with it's arms swinging by it's sides it walked across the clearing in probably no more than five or six seconds when i saw itstep out of the woods onto the edge of the blacktop i put on my brakes almost hiting it with my left front of the car .i still wonder to this day if i did not at least brush against it with my car .what was very interesting to me is all the pictures i see of bigfoot does not look like the one i saw  i was looking out the window and seen a tall creature on a rock cliff accross from the jail , at the mouth of chloe creek It looked at me and my brother (for what seemed like minutes but probably seconds, staring us in the eyes) overwhelmed with fear I geared down my fourwheeler It should be remembered that it was the press - not him that began using the term bigfoot The creature walked upright on two legs and stood about 6'10  After about ten seconds the driver put the truck in reverse and backed up 50 feet or so..we all got out of truck and asked one another if we had all saw it..we all did, but we werent sure what we had saw, some said a bear, some said 'bigfoot' He also found some unusual white hair and impressions on the ground It had brown eyes also told me his grandfather called them hairy men. He did not know why the creature evaded the line, but he remembers that he almost hung himself because it was so dark Half the way there, they were silenced by the discovery of the footprint, but their silence was only short lived  There, in the middle of our yard, not ten feet from where the tent had been four years ago..was an enormous creature, dark fur and hug eyes lit by our porch Sounds like ""a large animal walking through brush on 2 legs, stomping trough the water in the back of the chute where we were fishing, the water was about 4 feet deep and the animal was walking on 2 legs Standing 30 feet from me and approximately 20 feet from the woods was an extremely large creature I slowed and passed this thing and was no more than 4 feet away Walked towards the creeks and noticed a footprint in the field  But here lately we’ve had knocking on trees, slapping the side of our house footsteps and growling right outside our house very loose in motion with it's top part of it's curved foreward.it threw it' legs very far in front of it as it took it's step across the road A few feet farther another 7.5 inch footprint next too a tree about 3 feet high on the bank overlooking where the creeks merge Some of the old buildings around his house which was close to the sighting at the time had wierd looking hair stuck to the screens where we thought dogs had been going in or something It was about 36 to 42 inches tall, short legs and long arms, black hair 4 to 5 inches long, walking upright bipedily. We spent several hours backpacking the surrounding area and could not find any trace evidence, such as footprints, droppings, or hair well i jumped up on this rock and said ""Bang""! well when i did i heard a branch break on the right of me and immediatly i turned and with in 13' of this creature that was about 5' tall whith this hair that resembled a rabbit in color but was long  They both had red eyes and the bigger one looked like it was waving As I got closer I was astonished to see that whatever it was, was about 7 feet tall with Gray hair that covered the entire body  I’m not able to give any description of  the fur or hair that was covering it either The toes section was gone but the other 2/3rd of the foot was still there when we drove through it we had destroyed it..but this told us something..what we had saw had made the footprint, the print was fresh when we had saw it the first time..if it wasn't we would have destroyed it the very first time we went by the spot....We have went back a number of times trying to see this thing again with no luck...maybe someday...  It was taller then the top of my mini van and looked right at me,  we passed it in about 3 seconds Anyway, my dad had flood lights installed which only succeeded in lighting up the wall of trees and vegetation And so, if you're familiar with Land Between the Lakes, there's a huge dogman or big foot phenomenon here  It was at least 8 foot tall because as we passed it, it's upper torso towered well above the top of the vechicle which was a Ford Escort  His arms were longer than a humans.His legs about like a human  A head, arms, legs, etc  He pointed to his eyes, and pointed up the hill He stated to police that he had never been to this area before and knew nothing about alleged Bigfoot reports The foot steps came to the side of the blind and stopped It appeared to be a gray or white looking ape type animal on two legs, with one arm hanging over a wooden cross timber, which would be about 8-9 feet tall We both had already dropped our poles , My pistol was hammer back and aimed that direction , my wife was behind me holding onto my belt loops we were ready to go ,but afraid to go toward the truck,something was over there ! ""that aint no deer "" she said ""thats somebody"" We stood there for a couple of minutes (seemed like a hour)I felt it was right there watching us ! When we did get to the pick-up I opened drivers door so fast it broke the retaining spring on the hinge ,I put her in and locked the door ,wanted to see if there were dents in the side of bed,I walked around to the dark side of the truck with my flashlight,(the feeling of being watched at a disadvantage was overwhelming )when my wife started the engine ....I thought my heart stopped ! After I stumbled back around to the drivers side I turned on all of the lights (even the interior) swung around ,backed down to where the gear was  It stood erect and was covered in dark fur like a bear, which I imagined it must be, but it had no muzzle like a bear I might mention that I checked the woods out the next day and there were numerous broken branches up to a height of about 8 foot, and the ground showed obvious disturbance from its fleeing  When I tried to see the eyes I could NOT see them with my own the naked eyes  All at once a stick about 2 foot long come flying at me and landed right behind me When we were in line with the tree we looked where the bull was still looking when we saw what was very clearly a very large bipedal creature with light brown hair from head to toe  One was very dark brown/almost black and the slightly smaller one was almost blonde  Since it was now dark, we hurried along to the lodge and back to the campsite with our flashlights For as many years as I've been reading about bigfoots and wondering what an encounter would be like, I would not have predicted my reaction when I finally saw one for the first time that night  From the area of the trees where the sound traveled from was the figure of something very tall, very large in width and very strong, as some of the smaller pine trees about 10 to 15 feet in height were being shaken back and forth vigorously and violently All at once they took off running and the eyes disappeared Whoever made this footprint had come down from the steep slope on the left and gone down a shallow embankment on the right and into the stream I've now seen many black bears, in the wild and at zoos, but I have yet to see a black bear walk as swiftly or as gracefully on two legs as the creature I saw that august night of 1978 My son and I were heading home and about 100 feet in front of me I saw a dark colored figure in the road"
Louisiana,"It was about 7 feet tall or more and very large short of its feet Forest you must wear an orange vest and hat}it was white from the ground up on each leg about 12"" to 20"" up both legs I don't know what the french name they used for it, but as it came closer it was a lumbering, furry figure, with red eyes reflecting in the light The face was somewhat covered with hair but not as covered as the rest of the body 8' + tall, upright, bipedal, dark, hair-covered (apparent) hominid, with long arms, crossing a residential street in Marrero, La.  I pointed the light in the direction of the footsteps and turned it on From the head down the two creatures had long hair past their shoulders,with alot of long grayish hair tones, the rest of the body was short hair I checked the water depth by plungeing a six foot paddle into the water and could barely touch bottom with my arm immersed up to my elbow (an extra 18 inches of length over the paddle) Dark hair covered its body.It seemed to get up set becouse I did not run  I remember we were deep in the woods and we came up on a stream, quite large, about eight feet in width The whole time I was running toward the house (75 feet away), I kept my eyes focused on the origination of the sound coming from the forest edge Its hair was not long and bushy, but sleak and close to the body I had just finished surveying some timber to be cut and was driving back to file the survey when I saw several large footprints on the side of the road It had shaggy dark brown hair and was walking upright its very tall and very wide in the soulders  At this time i noticed that a pine tree roughly 5inches in diameter had been twisted and knocked over about 8-10 feet up.We hadnt had any storms recently and no other trees were damaged I was setting some coon traps on the edge of a powerline next to a wooded area after dark I guess it was at least seven foot tall I know what we saw it wasn't human at all and the arms and hair I could see its eyes, and its scalp was almost pointed  They came within eighty feet (measured during the investigation) of the creature as it stood looking at them from beside a large bush 6 to 6.5 feet tall In front of me was a creature that was at least 7' tall and very big,it was covered in hair Stopping to look I found over 20 some odd tracks that went into the woods on one side up the road then crossing the road and into the woods.I also noticed alot of deer hair,no blood The movement sounded to be only about ten feet from me I remember sitting there with my legs dangling thinking that it was too high for me to just jump straight down. As I looked up at the sky I was startled to death by an EXTREMELY loud scream that came from the very edge of the forest aboout 100 feet away it was almost like a gorila face but wasnt dark but grayish  The figure was a little darker its eyes where very dark and were very pupil big 100% bigfoot Melville LA approx 1:15 pm rainy day bigfoot walked out of the tree line took 5 steps to the right and back in to tree line about 100 yards away from our house. It had to be on two feet because the bamboo we were in was way over my head We began to look around when we noticed some reddish hair stuck to the barbs on the fence.Then thought hey there are no reddish colored cows,so why is this hair this color and on the top row of 4 row barb wire fence ( fence was 5 ft at the highest point) we then heard something moving in the woods (very thick and dense,lots of thorns)where the hair was at This creature had reddish brown hair all over its body about the length of a deer's hair long arms and wide It was about 7 feet tall and maybe 300, to 350 pounds.  The outline line looked like a big person with its head leaning forward and messy hair HE STATED THAT HE WAS COMING HOME FROM WORK , IT WAS DUSKY DARK, WHEN HE PULLED IN HIS DRIVEWAY AND STARTED UP THE HILL TO HIS HOUSE HE SAW SOMETHING VERY LARGE AND HAIRY AND DARK ON HIS PORCH  I don't remember if I could tell if it was walking on two legs or not but I thought it was strange that any wild animal would approach me when I had just finished hammering staples I always carry a chair to sit in, was sitting for about 35 minutes when I seen a very large man walking though the woods at 1st look The eyes did not glow, but were white around them I heard the footsteps, which were not of a 4 legged animal, walk past my side of the tent  This shadow filled the entire 8 foot window and had it was the shadow of something walking by Upon loading firewood into the truck, my grandfather and I saw a large, black, hairy creature about 50-60 yards from our truck As we got closer, our first impression was that it was a man with long grayish brown hair and long beard (a lot of hair on face) it had a more upright forehead that face it self wasnt all covered with hair  He noticed that it was covered from head to toe in thick, long, jet black hair  All I know is it filled up the 8 foot window and stepped over a 4 1/2 foot chain link fence Alot of deer tracks were in and around the tracks I had found.The tracks had 5 toes on each foot.They went approx 1/2 to 1inch into the gravel and sand along the road well i was driving on I49 between alexandria and shreveport near natchitoches this was in the early  1990's and was comming back from my grandmothers house it was late in the evening about 2 hours before dark in the early spring it has been so long now it is hard to remember much else about time of year but i do remember the sighting well I was in the woods walking around and turning to the deeper recesses of the forest, I saw a rather tall figure coming toward me on two legs I could hear the gravel under its feet  We were looking at two Human/Ape like figures whom were completely covered with darkish brown gray hair but the face appeared to be of lighter tone skin I believe that throughout the course of my life, (I'm 27 now), I have encountered this ""bigfoot"" twice, possibly three times in three different states It was about 8-9ft.tall and at the least (500lbs).The shoulder span was around 4-5Ft THIS FENCE WAS 6 FT TALL , AND BEFORE DONALD COULD GET HIS CAR STOPPED IT CLEARED THE FENCE , ONE LEAP FROM A STANDING POSITION It was reddish brown, covered with hair and we could see it's eyes  Then I heard my sister say what is that? I looked, and standing at the edge of the woods in between two trees I saw this tall, black,thing On the edge of the levee was a creature that appeared to be about 6ft tall long legs and arms With the moon being up in the sky, whatever cast the shadow had to have been taller than 5 feet  I was also followed out of the woods after dark one night later that year by what must have been the same thing because when i shined my light in its direction it whooped and ran off just like before No sooner had i lost sight of him i hear movement to the left of the spot he went in, shortly after this i heard him come running back to the fence row, he was yelling i saw it, i saw it..he jumped that barbed wire fence in stride with his dog hot on his heels  The hair around the face was also long and he couldn't make out any facial features I have had dreams about bigfoot ever since. I felt that little charge of fear race up my spine and I remember that the hairs were standing up on my arms and neck, and at that moment my mother came back ! and started to shut the door, when all of a sudden we both heard this SCREAM went back the next day i would say to was 9 to 10 feet tall When it came within a few feet, my uncle panicked and slapped my grandfather and they dropped everything they had with them and ran like hell all the way back home it was very hairy or fury so i lifted my head all the way up to look up into the eyes of bigfoot  It was hard to discern at first what it's appearance was but as it got closer, I noticed it was covered from head to toe with a thick coat of dark hair I saw eyeshine ahead I I told him to back away so my dog will come to me and we will go home Because of today's report of a Bigfoot Body, my memory was jarred by a story from my now deceased grandfather It scratched it's head and looked around and began to shuffle one foot back and forth (as if it was shifting its weight) .It was also making ""blowing sounds like a deer does"" When I was just starting to doze off again, I heard footsteps entering our camp From going over this over and over in my head it was around 5-6 feet tall  It was at this time he realized that he was not looking at a horse but a large bipedal creature What startled us really wasn't the size but the stride! The stride was double our stride, the tracks appx were 8 ft apart!!! I believe in big foot and i know all we've ever seen was these tracks, but i know what i saw was not made by a human We were in a 14 foot flat bottom boat with a three horse power outboard motor Due to its hair I could only make out its nose and eyes features MY DAD LEFT AND RAN ACROSS THE STREET TO OUR PASTURE TOWARD HIS SHOP, HE SAW A LARGE THICK MAN-LIKE CREATURE RUN AND LEAP THE CREEK, WHICH WAS A LEAST 10 FEET ACROSS  Whitstine stated that he got as close as maybe twenty feet Hairy all over, but a light gray color Since October I have had many howls, wood knocks, eyeshine instances It was at least 6-7 feet tall We just passed my aunt;s house on 175 and about 6 miles down the road we were coming around this curb and we saw this up right creature crossing the road and when we got up on it I saw it's right arm and legs as it step into the woods  I'm not saying this was a bigfoot From the side of which we approached the stream we were about five feet above the water and as we approached the stream the three of us immediately spotted two Creatures on the other side of the stream in a crouching posture position drinking water from the stream stated to me that he was returning from work one afternoon when he came out of a curve in the road (gravel) traveling West and saw a creature he estimates to have been 6-7 feet in height and weighing over 300 lbs  i was heading north about 20 miles from natchitoches when down in a valley on the right hand side of the road there was a fence about 100 yards away next to a piney forest and a burned out patch of woods i saw a very tall black hairy creature standing on two feet i guess it was over 6 ft tall from that distance that is all i can say about the height We started to become very scared and aggitated as we could not identify it visually and by this point were exceedingly close (approx 15 yards) and could already discern what apeared to be eye sockets, nose and mouth behind a long matted hair The arms were swinging in a pumping like fashion, like a sprinters arms would pump i found no foot prints or anything.the ground is very hard we have had no rain.Heard  It walked around the entire tent and I saw a shadow on the end of the tent about 5 feet high Iturned back an the creature turned to look also.The smell was like awet deer but ten times worse.The creature was around 8-9ft.tall that there was something moving closer to a group of wild hogs about 40 feet from us.When it got closer we saw what appeared to be a man ""duck walking"" towards the hogs It had extra long arms and a very thin body What i saw was 2 eyes a gray/white color with reddess hair,the top of the head was hiddien by brush,the bridge of the nose was very apparent,straight,long and narrow the rest was hidden from view"
Maine," I decided to call it a night at 10:30 and wanted to relieve myself before I went to bed so I went outside across the porch, down the front steps and walked approximately 15 feet to the back outside corner of the camp I have also seen what I believe to be bent trees caused by bigfoots. I was about an hour into my trek and I see off the beaten path a series of footprints On the evening of November 12th  2020, my wife and I had returned to our camp after an afternoon deer hunt, it was dark by the time we got back to camp and settled in for a routine evening with getting the camp warmed up, supper, a couple hands of cribbage and talking – we had been in camp for 10 days One morning I hunted alone south of the lake, when I encountered a strange musky smell in the woods along with a foot-long black scat that looked human except for the extraordinary thickness and width From the power lines to the road is roughly 400 ft of woods and has a trail about 30 feet behind where we saw the creature that goes straight to the road By the looks of the size of the prints and the distance in stride, this seems like an adult sasquatch, These things were huge!! The sun was setting and my phone was dying so to my dismay I had to turn around and get back to the path before dark, otherwise I would have followed those tracks until they lead me to whatever made them, and we know what made those beasts! This is the BEST day ever I look up to see what they were looking at and about 200 yards down the powerlines we see a massive bipedal creature walking towards us this was NOT, I repeat NOT like any other tracks we have seen, the track had no claw marks, I've been an avid watcher of Finding Bigfoot and do wood knocks regularly along with screams The hair on my neck was raised and the pit of my stomach seemed suddenly queasy as the rotten smell got worse I am thinking I just missed that squatch by a matter of minutes or hours! SO CLOSE! Well, let me tell you what!! These things were 12'' long and the stride between steps was measured at 8 feet! The line of prints was straight, just like you see with other evidence of a bigfoot trail! It was INSANE I still have no idea what it was and it was so dark, I didn’t see anything but I can tell you that I’ve never heard or experienced anything like that in the many years I’ve spent in those woods and the 30+ years I’ve owned that camp. I went back to my trailer on my qaud which was parked about 200 feet down the trail I have seen footprints of what I believe is a juvenile bigfoot My very first bigfoot evidence and experience and I couldn't be happier!!! There is literally NOTHING else this could be, it is an amazing and documented bigfoot footprint trail!"
Manitoba,
Maryland," When it turned, its arms appeared to be long and muscular and I could see that its back was very muscular too and had a ""V"" shape to it, which led me to believe that this was no bear As we where halfway across the log something landed in the creek about 5 feet from me that had to be the size of a paint bucket I recall seeing the thing's eyes blinking at me, from a distance of 2-4 feet After dinner we sat around the fire as the darkness grew and we all began to feel a bit spooked, as if we were being watched, so we let the fire burn itself out and bedded down  I smelled a horrible pungent odor, heard heavy breathing and large foot steps coming from the near by wooded area He advised to me that it was no bear that could stand that tall, walk on hind legs! The time we had seen 3 of them was at the beginning of September  I got my uncle up off the ground and he told me as he was walking down the grassy trail, he heard long loud foot steps coming up from behind him A few moments later the eyes raise up to be about 5 off the ground and rotate slightly more towards us It is about 75 yards long and about 30 yards wide with very tall cliffs, about 50 to 80 feet tall in some places It was summer and the sun was getting ready to go down so it was dusk-like -- I turned - and by the way so did the dog - our Labrador Retriever -  and could not believe my eyes We have alot of deer but they are not vertical or that tall Me and my husband think we have seen a family of bigfoots  It appeared that there was a large dark silhouette walking back and forth in the foliage I would estimate it to be at least 8 feet to the shoulder and hunched forward, almost on four legs but definitely NOT a quadruped I'm not sure where EXACTLY but it was between a number of farms and on a road off of 404 which we considered a shortcut My friend and I saw what I can only describe as an absolutely enormous hairy creature moving VERY fast from the passenger side of the road to the left side I saw a pair of eyes off in the woods some ways up, perhaps 100 meters when I noticed them and as we were closing rapidly I braked fairly heavily The light from the roadway was behind and to the thing's left, so I wasn't able to make out any distinct features, other than the eyes and the teeth The most recent sighting was 10-8-2006 and I'm telling you it was 7""2 and huge, with big yellow eyes We stood in shock, never removing the light from those eyes ""See,"" I say, ""It is just a deer."" As soon as that last word leaves my mouth the eye reflections stand up another 4 feet to be standing at a towering 9 feet we heard a yelling noise and footsteps My bed lay roughly 2 feet from and parallel to the bedroom window Swinging the light around we caught the reflections of two more sets of eyes I remember saying to my freind ""What the hell is going on?"" His response was to tell me GO!!! We took off running and reached our only real obsticle, a creek about 10 feet wide where we had to cross on a log Some of the cows and dogs on the farms surrounding us were making noise like they normally do also And whatever this was sent the hairs on my neck up and it clearly startled my mom and shut the animals in the woods up also. The eyes and the teeth contrasted sharply from the darkness of the rest of the head I get caught in a frenzy of shinning the light back and forth between all three sets of eyes until they just quietly disappear What I saw can only be described as a large head, with distinct hair covering it; it was much, much larger than any human head  I peered through my 4 X rifle scope to examine the object more closely and observed it to walk upright and was covered with dark brownish hair  We both got flash lights and tried to look in the wooded area where we heard the heavy breathing but did not see anything but heard what sounded like bipedal footsteps go down the large decline and cross the creek at the bottom We only walked about 20 feet when something came crashing through the tree branches and hit the ground near us very hard  It was dark and I could not see anything and I got an eerie feeling of being watched At the time, I didnt know about the connection between the rocks being thrown at us and the screaming to bigfoot, but it sounds like a classic case I observed a large - I am guessing 10-11 feet high - ape-like figure stalking in the woods behind the pond - I would say it was about 100 yards away"
Massachusetts,"I have always hiked in the woods around here and done a lot of tracking animals of all kinds, I have never seen anything that would resemble a bigfoot track, I have always had doubts about people seeing these, but now I will never doubt it again I wanted to say something about it now because I just say a program on TV the other night about bigfoot and the Kiamichi Mountians, I think in Oklahoma or somewhere out there  I never saw any sign of this creature again, but after reading what the men in Mashpee saw 2-3 years later, it sounds like Cape Cod might have a Bigfoot of some kind.  It immediately took off around the back of the house, running on two legs, and through an open breeze way to the front and into the woods The tracks were about 6 to 7 feet apart Hello! This is something that happened a long time ago and to be honest I never thought it could be connected to Sasquatch/Bigfoot but recently I’ve been reading about the topic a lot and I figured I’d send it to you guys after finding your site and just checking out reports from areas where I’ve lived in the past When returning  the next day I discovered a good size pile of feces on the trail about 15 feet away from the tree I had knocked on 7-8ft tall and very broad with black hair As we walked back, we both noticed some very DEEP foot prints that did not look right Myself and a friend used the snowmobile with a sled attached to the back, we took turns driving the ski doo around and the other would stand on the foot rest on the sled It would travel parallel through the woods about 100 feet behind my house We both looked at each other and said, why would someone be running Barefoot, in 100 degree weather in the middle of the woods on a Tuesady afternoon? There were no other people in the woods at that time I forgot about it for many years until I saw some ""bigfoot"" documentary in the early 1990's My friend and I left the cabin with the snowmobile, he was driving first and I was on the foot rest on the sled Lying on the ground was what looked like a 3 foot wooden club with a jagged end where the roots would be, it looked like something that you would see in a cave man picture It sounded dead and not tall.. So I dialed my buddy and as he picked up the phone, a rock about the size of a football, if not bigger was thrown about three quarters across the swamp and I saw this one hit the water. That theory ended when we went outside to see what the creatures footprints looked like, we were shocked to see hoofed footprints Hello, I have been a believer that Big Foot exist for years just based on how many people have reported seeing or hearing something over hundreds of years I was driving near the town dump about 1:00 in the afternoon around the end of June last year, it was raining very hard, a large figure came out of nowhere, I hit my brakes but was far enough back that I would not have hit it, there was a car coming at me the other way, it almost ran into the back end of that car, it turned a little sideways to avoid the car, that's when I knew it was not a person or a bear, when it turned it flung its arm up and back a little to miss the car, it was a little hunched over, its shoulders were extremely wide, I couldn't make out any facial features, it was covered in dark brown hair and appeared to have hardly any neck, it was about 6"" taller than the mini van it almost ran into, if it was standing straight up I would guess it was about 6 to 6 and a half feet tall It was too tall to be a person in a suit approx I am very sure of what I saw it was a dark haired looked very much like a bear walking on two legs. or so, it was just getting a little dark At this point I looked behind me to see if my friend was on the sled and holding on, when I looked up I saw this creature walking on 2 legs like a human  The sounds were about a distance of 100 feet from our position on the trail, within a thicker patch of woods I remember listening to Bigfoot calls years back and on a hunch ran inside found the EXACT same howls on the net sounded like the Snohomish, WA 1978-79 calls There were also 2 holes in the ground one next to a tree, the hole about 12 inches in diameter and close to 20 inches deep the other about 5 feet away from the tree 3 or 4 inches in diameter and only 4 or 5 inches deep with the club laying on its side and the small end partially in that hole Footprints in the snow, walking through several properties and into the woods We had just built a two story addition which is situated further back on a lot (about 150 feet) into the woods from the street I remember it looking at us and I remember the arms swing clearly I and my girlfriend were riding in my Jeep on Route 140 from New Bedford to Freetown tonight (July 14, 2009) and at about 11:00 my girlfriend seen this large brown hair covered ""man"" standing up from a crouched position on the side of the two lane highway You could hear the crashing of a two footed creature  It was about 6, maybe 6 and a half feet tall, had long brown hair all over it's body, and was stock still  To the best of my memory, the face was fury, whatever it was it only around 5-6 feet tall I could tell the first print was a right foot, that jumped out of the woods It was getting dark...uneventfully I hiked back Did a couple Bigfoot calls It was very tall ( well over seven feet ) All black hair, didn't notice any smells, but I can tell you this We did not have a deck or anything at the time and the woods were about 25 feet behind the house The woods at that time were covered with thick vines and brambles that were about 3-5 feet high  As this creature got closer, my ears and experience told me that this was a biped, only 2 feet crunching through the leaves While solo camping at the shelter I decided to call a big foot in The sixth and final step was a left foot that looked like it pushed off into the woods At first it looked like someone possibly in a gilley suit but then as I got closer I couldn't believe my eyes because it looked just like what you hear about and see artist renderings of a bigfoot like creature I hit my flashlight in order to make it brighter and I seen big eyeshine and a dark sillouette of what looked to be shoulders I said, maybe it was a Bigfoot"
Michigan,"It was very shaggy and very tall  I had just crested a small hill when about 200-250 yards in front of me I saw a very large, reddish brown creature on two legs run across the road and into a very thick and wooded area He was all dark gray in color with no body definition The eyes were close and deep set but aggressive in its gaze, the mouth was agap  The lighting on it was poor and I couldn't make out any facial features besides the eyes and it was staring right back at me  It was tall and dark I have three encounters with what I believe to be Bigfoot or an unknown crpytid From my distance all I could see was jet black fur and no noticeable ears, the eyes were not noticeable or black as well About thirty yards in front of me a bigfoot ran from left to right It was very dark, because I left the outdoor light off I was fishing and all of a sudden a huge rock hit the water like 50 feet down from me and make quite a big splash The creature was not a bear and closely resembled an ape like human form, covered with dark brown hair, but lighter in the facial area, with broad shoulders When I was stationed in the U.P.of Michigan's K.I Sawyer air force base,I travelled sometimes to see my family in the Detroit area.This was 1977-1978.A friend and I were driving on M-28,east of Munising.They may call it the Seney Stretch area.This was after an afternoon shift,so leaving the Marquette area at midnight or so would put us in the sighting area at around 1:30 am.This was winter time and quite cold.as we were driving,we both were looking down the road straight ahead.A mile or so up the road was a slight knoll or small hill and we could see the glow of headlamps from the other side highlighting the top of the knoll.Between us and the headlamp glow,we observed what we first thought was a bear crossing the road.It was at least 1/2 a mile up the road,but the headlamp glow from the other side of the hill outlined this thing quite clearly.It walked sort of hunched over until it reached the center of the road and then it stood upright and we could make out broad,manlike shoulders and arms.Bear shoulders are tapered downwards.These were broad.It then shlouched over a little and crossed the road.We just looked at each other with our jaws open.We slowed down near the area.It was cold,there were no houses or lights in the area and there was no reason for a man to be in this area in that weather at that time of night with not a house in sight.I don't remember if there was a bright moon or not,but we looked for tracks.We didn't look for long due th the temprature and the unknown in the middle of nowhere There is a gap between houses where the sound came from that is maybe 12-15 feet wide with a shrub-line roughly 6 feet from the side of our house, and all the snow was totally undisturbed we shined our lights closer on them and realized they were NOT from a snowshoer but there was clearly shaped FOOT prints , toes and all   I do not recall the way the feet looked or whether it had a tail or not I had not known anything about big foot at the time I saw the term ""diabolical"" used to describe a sound heard by someone filing a report and I have to totally agree that this is maybe the most apt description I could ever imagine of the sound I heard that night  I don't know that it was a bigfoot however it was scarry enough for me to remove the safety from my gun and actually swing in the direction it came from knowing my partner was in that direction as well  My friend didn’t want to be there in the dark but I am an intuitive medium and I have no fear of the dark with the things I deal with and i just gotta say i think your BFRO is a great thing and i know someday bigfoot will be proven true . I heard brush cracking across my road, I shined my light and seen a set of bright green large eyes  As I made my turn it was about 10 feet off to my right Each rock landed and rolled only a few feet, suggesting the rocks had been lobbed upwards rather than thrown directly into the camp  When our relative asked us ""why wouldn't a bigfoot throw rocks"", we realized we may have identified it as human too quickly and unfortunately may have missed more detailed identification through the investigation of footprints. i would almost have to run and leap to make those strides  He had very large strides and his legs were bent like someone running but he was walking We got out to check out an area, see how the river is, all of a sudden we hear a real heavy sounding animal moving through the thick Tag Alders and brush on the non riverside of the road but right as that goes silent we hear another big creature on the river side, it goes from just making enough noise for us to notice that there is 2 big animals that seemed to be traveling together and it seems like we had interrupted them crossing the road so the one that was like 30 to 40 feet away suddenly does what I can only imagine was a bluff charge through the thick brush just knocking every Tad Alder and branch down with authority  My wife pointed to them and asked me what kind of animal would make that track, when I looked over I noticed that the tracks were that of  something walking upright on two legs Suddenly, while driving west on M-50 near the Jackson County border, a large bipedal, reddish-brown/auburn(brother-in-law's description) colored creature crossed the highway from passenger-to-driver side in front of us  It was around 10 pm and was quite dark when we were driving south on H37  It was maybe about 3 to 4 feet tall and it was runing with long arms swaying back and forth I never thought much of them until hearing the exact sounds on the show Finding Bigfoot We looked for more tracks, but only found one other--about ten feet away---closer to the railroad  Whatever I saw was just shy of nine feet tall His skin had a tawny reddish hue and his body and face/head was covered in a deep chocolate hair/fur  A few days later, we were conveying the story to a relative jokingly referring to it as our ""bigfoot story""  It stood hunched over approximately 5 feet tall It had long dangling arms long wispy reddish brown colored hair about 400 lbs hunched back arms swinging  It stood on its hind legs and with two large steps, it disappeared into the woods as we passed at about 45 mph We were about 110 feet away We got on-line and looked up ""bigfoot"" recordings for Michigan and other states  In addition, it was standing on two legs and kinda peering at me from around a tree (it would later move into the trail.) Even though I could not move or yell, my mind was still working i thought maybe a bear was standing trying to see where we were coming from and ran off on it's hind legs I later measured the site and estimated the strides I do recall its eyes sort of reminding my like that of an orangutang and sunken in There didn’t seem to be much hair on its face but it did have some When I got down the dune onto the beach near a group of people I immediately turned and looked up the hill, but could no longer see anything there in the darkness of the hill  He was very much like other people had described him tall, hairy, and buff While I had almost no knowledge of Bigfoot at the time, looking back on it, I suspect that one or more of the hairy things was traveling up that power line cut and spotted me sitting in the blind, then took to the forest again and stopped and tried some vocalizations and tree branch breaking in an attempt to intimidate me into leaving the area  My brother took a turn ahead of me, he was about 50 feet or so in front of me, as I began my turn to follow to the left my headlight caught something next to a 6” cedar, it stood about 7 or more feet, it had its left hand on the tree, looking over its bicep at me, its body was turned toward my brother His arms were also longer then a man’s It stood up on 2 legs looked at my boyfriend, took 2 steps to the west and was into the swamp  During this episode they talked about a particular bigfoot researcher All I can describe it is as a ""head"" appeared in a broken window, which had to be over six feet from the base of the camper No trees, just tall weeds Piles of bones stacked two and three feet high in a very dense area of the wood i was sitting in an s10 blazer and was looking up at it at a distance of maybe 40 to 50 feet  But I have to say that two days after I saw the creature it was reported on the local radio station that a bigfoot was spotted on the same highway and the DJ made fun of the report It was too dark for visual I shrugged and swung the tracker, when I swung back into the trail toward the truck the trail was filled with animal twenty feet in front of me  I am still baffled to this day as to what this being was; although something in my gut tells me that I saw a ""baby bigfoot"". We all agreed on the color, height, eye color, head, and strides The eyes glowed red from the reflection of the car headlights  It's arms extended down almost to it's knees, and it's shoulders were very wide I had heard of Yeti, in the Himalayas, and Sasquatch in the Pacific north west, but never Bigfoot The creature stood between 6'5"" and 7'5"" tall, was dark brown in color, had course hair, and a rounded head It was 5/10/15, 40 degrees out, water temp about the same, and they crossed the river...there isn't anything over there for miles but woods and the river is four foot deep right there they were over a foot long looked like bones from a deer and were snapped clean and looked bleached from sun I can still see him clear as a bell running through the forrest at full stride I would guess the sizes 8 and 10 (shoe size)  I ride alone alot and would rather not have bigfoot around here. It was 40 - 50 feet away tops. Last week while hunting I noticed what I thought was a dead bear about 30 yards to my right( I only looked in that direction because of very foul odor), it was hairy and just laying there, it looked out of place and had no movement  I honestly don't know what I saw but I believe it was a Bigfoot. The next day there were large footprints in the snow coming out of the woods along side my family's house Made the hair on the back of my neck stand up The prints were very clear and the snow beneath the print was particularly icy as if heat from the foot itself had melted the snow During a walk after dark I was chase by an enormous creature which ran on two feet and was most definately not human  They laughed at me and told me it was the ""Bigfoot"" that lives in the area  He said It was huge, about 8 feet at least, and hairy, brown/black and could just step over the barbed wire fence with no problem I really tried to see the face, too, but it was totally dark  And I still could see the red eyes, they didn't move Right there, just inches from his boot was an incredibly huge ""human"" footprint We think it was a Bigfoot. It is very rugged country with only a few foottrails that we keep open for access These were human bare-foot tracks  The stride of this creature was at least five feet I got extremely scared so I had my dad and brother come get me, and that is when we then found footprints all along the middle of the dirt road and it went on it seems like miles I creature of some sort I would say about 7 to 8 feet tall walked across the two track  Both my wife and I have heard what sounds like a pair of ""bigfeet"" walking thru woods by my house, dragging something and grunting back and forth at each other both were black with red eyes I said it sounded like it came from over there, turning to the direction of the noise, we both saw this big upright animal covered in hair This was possibly 20 foot from me Then I realised what I heard was possibly a bigfoot It had longish arms and the legs weren't very long in comparison  Later that night my whole family heard screams, we assumed it was bigfoot eating a deer but we weren't sure. It ran up the hill on two feet and it looked like a kind of ""skip"" like a ape  The hair/fur was a rather rusty brown and wavy or matted It was about 7 to 8 feet tall, covered in black fur from head to toe  The area around the head had longer hair in the back  I figured it wasa just bacuase it was so dark  At the top of the two track, a large, dark figure stood in the middle of the road staring at us It “wasn’t really long”, and the hair “looked smooth” My dad shined the flashlight into the field we saw greenish looking eyes above the brust and a little off to the distance I have NEVER in my life read about signs of a bigfoot or anything of the kind so I don't know what to look for, but it occurred to me that something odd is going on in the woods behind my house in Northern Michigan (my summer home) While I was waiting right before it was too dark to see I heard a roar unlike anything I have ever heard  I waited until it was completely dark or a little after and abruptly started getting ready to depart The only reason I even noticed it was because this large dark object stuck out in this empty colorless flat field I explained what had happened, my neighbor stated it could have been a Black Bear walking on his hind legs looking for the garbage The massive ARMS swung at its sides as it walked and it's strides were nearly 8 feet apart As he took off the eyes, still looking directly at me seemed to retreat back into the woods a few yards then got low to the ground continuing to go further and further into the woods I had forgotten all about this when one day the following April I was watching an old episode of the television series “In Search Of” that was about the search for Bigfoot It was definitely on two feet not 4 not even about 300 feet away from the gate we heard a strange sound but didnt think anything of it so we kept walking  THE SUN LIGHT ON THE ROAD HAD ALL READY CAUGHT MY ATTENTION WHEN I SAW A TALL, MUSCULAR, HAIRY,BROWN,HUMAN LOOKING THING WITH A BIG HEAD Upright, Redish in color, and tall Ive asked myself a 1000 times could this have been a bear, maybe it hurt its front legs and was forced to try to escape on its hind legs.  As I drove off (about maybe--?  50-100 yards) as I had already turned on the radio and was feeling pretty relaxed I noticed from off the left side of my car (from the headlights shining onto some of the trees and roadway) a large black, furry looking figure standing completely in the front of the tree line looking dead, straight at me with some powerful--menacing eyes It was very tall  I then asked my brother to retrieve my binoculars from by day pack on my back, because that was the ""tallest person"" I'd ever seen and wanted to take a closer look After two days raining only tracks on the river were deer, and mine...until I found two sets of barefoot tracks We were on our way back to the cottage and should I say this dirt road we were on runs right through a very dense woodland area that is almost dark in the day time due to the canopy of the trees above road, so at night our line of vision ended as soon as the trees began on the side of the road i noticed what looked like very large prints in the snow to my right and right away thought it was from someone on snowshoes but even though it was late at night there was quite a bit of light out so even with the flashlights not on the prints you could see clearly they were to far apart in stride so this struck erik and i  This animal was about 6'8"", had a grey/brown hair and seemed to have arms that were longer than a human's what ever this was looked in my direction and jumped to its feet( it was standing upright) it really got up in a hurry and made a quick exit and it was running upright away from me  The arms were longer than a man, and it seemed frozen as it looked at us It was a very tall tree and the lowest branch was several feet over my head  My Mother and I observed a large hairy creature kneeling on the north side of Geddes Road, (edited) As I was running, I remember being so afraid it was going to grab me, as it was coming slowly towards me and was only about 6 feet or so away when I ran And his arms swung back and forth in exaggerated motions The creature was not tall by any means probably in the low 6 foot range, I would compare to my current height of 6'1""  What I will never forget is the visual sight of it running across the road and then, in one single, seemingly effortless bound, leaping completely across and clearing a livestock fence that was approximately 4 to 4.5 feet tall Again the ground was tore up so bad that no distinguishing footprints were apparent  I then got my binoculars out and seen that its legs were hairy What she first noticed was its arms and hands that hung down past its knees There is no doubt that it was either a Sasquatch or someone in a very large big foot suit The creature had no real noticable features, it's body was completely fur/ hair covered,the fur was similar to that I've seen on a moose, very dull looking Thank the lord they were treed in the beechwoods 30 feet off the gravel road with the prettiest sleeping bobcat you ever seen in the tree. Drone footage revealed our location to be in a remote area with opened swamp land, wooded habitation for local wildlife and full of game trails i was walking my dog in the woods by Kalamazoo MI and my dog was acting really strange growling alot and thats when i saw the foot print it was not there the night before. We turned around to see a large pair or red almost orange eyes looking down at us from just within the woods  It looked like it was hairy all over -  I saw a hint of reddish, light brown colored hair on the forearm and shoulder The arms were very long hung down just above it's knees That is when I turned to look straight out the window, the window was about 4 feet from me, and I found myself staring straight into the big , yellowed, bloodshot eyes of a sasquatch I saw what I feel was Big Foot, in 1979 I can best describe the creature as about 7 to 8 feet tall very dark in color and like I stated previously had a face that looked like a cross between a man and a gorilla  Around the midnight hour we hear this ""ROAR"" come from the shore line which was black due to the thick woods and we were on the water; within seconds something splashed into the water about 10 feet or less from the boat!  We were both pretty startled and speechless we just started the motor and headed back to the lodge ""Paradise Lodge"" And thats when the hair on the back of my neck stood on end It looked like it was unkept and even sort of dread-locked appearance hair That morning it was dark, and I was waiting for the school bus, I was alone She was viewing it from the side, which was dark as the moon was on the other side of it It's eyes glowed green at us as it paused to stare a moment, and then turned into the woods Interestingly, the area around us is still farms with corn, srawberries, and other crops growing most of the year, even though the area is ten minutes from Dearborn, Michigan. My Grandson (11 years old at the time) and I were hunting for deer in the back end of the Clay Bank swamp, this time on the north end of it, opposite of my earlier encounter, when it was getting twilight we decided to call it a day, picked up our equipment and started a slow walk back to my truck, only got about 50 yds when a 6 point buck ran within 20 feet to the front of us, and about 6 feet behind the deer was a sasquatch chasing him, it had its arms outstretched to grab the deer, it was black and in the 8 ft area, really big All of a sudden, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up and I felt very uneasy as if something was watching me He walked away from me in long, strong strides The heel mark, the toes, the way the feet taper from wide in the front to narrow by the heel We kept on hearing leaves crackling like something was walking around and we could tell it was walking on two legs because it was a steady, slow walking pace And this is a man that used to bait bear with only a 10 inch knife!!!! And releases wolves, that get caught in his coyote traps!!!  He's seen hundreds of bears and has tracked them in the dark I looked at this animal for a minute or less when it pivoted on it's back foot, took one stride into the swamp, and then disappeared  I had white hair, looked like a horse standing tall, looking at me, but when it turned sideways, to run, there was no large body behind it  The creature in front of me was all one uniform color, either dark brown or black To this day I am still puzzled as to why we did not find any tracks of the left foot---and only found two tracks at that As I turned to see what had happened, I saw a large hairy arm reaching in 100 feet from where we were This afternoon I found a large foot print in a nearby sandbox (I'll have a follow up on that, I have pictures) Me and my freind alan where walking back out of green timbers after a day of deer hunting it was about 7 or 8 when w both seen it at the same time it was about 6 to 8 feet tall and 300 to 500 pounds it just simply walked out of the woods walking to the corn feild got about half way to the corn and stopped looked at us and turned around and walked right back in the woods dident make a sound not even a twig broke when we got up there to ware he was he was gone no sign and no noise there was nothing The stride was about 6 feet long  It was very large and probably stood around 7 or 8 feet tall  Then he stepped down into the field on the side of the road, it was about 50 feet to the forest, then when he went up to the edge of the forest, he stopped once again, and did that funny turning of his head to look back at me one more time and then he took one big kind of a side step into the forest, and he was gone  I was amazed by the quietness of the forest area and the very tall pine tree stands It seemed to walk with its arms to its side with maybe the forearms slightly facing out/forward like a jogger but its arms didn’t swing at all to my recall As we were taking pictures of the footsteps, we heard something  We found some type of foot that was bigger than my dads When he continued forward the animal then on all fours rises on two feet towering above his tiny Geo tracker It passed in front of a curve sign, going into a swamp, that was 9-10 ft tall and only 6 inches of the sign showed above its head!! It was very black with long arms He says it was too a dark in the canopy of the woods to see a face, but the reason he noticed it at all was that it was moving exactly like the figure ""in that old grainy footage that everyone always talks about"" (the Patterson footage) The thought of the existence of another bipedal primate is a shock to most people, including me So he recalls only that it was bigger than a bear, its hair was darker red than a deer, and he was impressed by the strength or force of its stride  It was midafternoon when I heard a sound in the woods behind our home that reminded of sounds that bigfoot researchers make on television shows when they are calling to see a bigfoot is in the area She made eye contact with it at 15 feet and saw its eyes glowing a “blood red”  It appeared that if standing on the ground it wouldn't be much over 28 to thirty inches tall He says the arms were longer than its torso and that he could tell it had fur much in the same way you can tell a dog has fur from a distance, that it wasn't skin that he was seeing They had a swamp directly behind their house, and their housekeeper (who is now deceased) used to tell them ""There's something in that swamp."" When I 1st started researching on the internet what I'd seen, I didn't think ""Bigfoot"",as it looked so different from the descriptions I'd heard and the photos I'd seen  It's arms were longer than humans Its hair was black to brown not long, not short, the nose flat, with a face not covered in hair like its body The branches started at about four feet from the ground When it got within ten feet I started backing up to keep a distance between me and it I just heard about the BFRO today from my mother who told me right away about this bigfoot investigation team coming to marquette and this subject is something im very passionate about especially after an encounter my bestfriend erik and i had a couple years ago , the only people i ever told was some family and ofcouse discussing with my buddy over the years since   (The eyes followed me as I went past)  If it were to stand up perhaps another foot or two could be added to it's height biking near a creek I stoped for a break and noticed a set of foot prints that followed the edge of the creek In three more strides the creature stood across the road where a trail led into the woods (behind the church on the corner)  There were no Bigfoot sightings and he hadn’t even been named yet We went back to the area we saw him crossing the road and looked for footprints but the road didnt show prints My friend has also had large footprints in his driveway and has a local friend of his son has seen a pair of eyes, really high up and not very far away in the weeds while he and my friend's son and another boy were out jumping on a trampoline in the early evening one night 2 yrs ago and now he won't go out at night, and he is 16yrs old   I had a Bigfoot sighting in Michigan  I couldn't see their color or texture because of the darkness, and they were definitely not human I found no foot prints in that area the next day  To our findings, we did find very large foot prints, you could make out the toes as they were heading up the incline from the water We found 2 bones maybe 40 or 50 feet from our tents there were no other bones to be found so the kill was not there It was just outside the edge of the woods--also in snow and also a right foot I never looked for hair or tracks  there was a good foot of leaf cover so tracks were unlikely I never thought of it as a big foot just an unexplainable anomaly  My buddy and I just joked it off as being ""bigfoot"", but I have lived near that area almost all my life, and I heard stories of people seeing something strange out there since I was a small kid...I am now 38 years old There were what could have been footprints but the ground was so tore up, it was impossible to tell what kind they were seven or eight feet tall It was definitely walking, not standing still, and it's arms were swinging Also, our German Shepherd had his tale between his hind legs, and was whining like he was scared 4.	This was a time BEFORE Bigfoot He was facing me swinging his arms side to side, right left, and had stopped growling but was kind of grunting.( I say he as it was very masculine looking.)It was covered with orange hair To this day I have no difinitive proof of what I saw to be a Bigfoot  We told her about the big hairy black stump with a face Just like a bare footprint would look in the sand on the beach---except this one was in frozen snow It seemed to me that we could only follow these tracks if we were either very tiny (like a squirrel) or very tall (say 8 or 9 feet) and very strong  My sister-in-law said, ""My gosh, now we passed a cop to boot.""  We kept talking all the way home, wondering and questioning ourselves as to what we saw and if it was possible that it truly was this giant white furry Bigfoot as we like to call it I looked up and saw a hairy brown man like creature sitting up against the fence post The thing I saw did not look like the typical ""big foot"" creatures shown on films and photos I was about 30 feet away this time It's head and shoulders blocked most of the window which was about 6 feet off the ground The first night, Wednesday the 30th of May, 2018 was mainly uneventful, though I went to use a tree earlier in the day behind our campsite and happened to look down to my right and smack in the middle of a game trail were two large footprints We could barely make out the outline it appeared to stand 7 foot or so, could not make out features well  No foot prints He stood on two legs  I did however find something like hairy, muddy fingerprints on the window pane I immediately spun the bike around a took off at full throttle, bending foot pegs and mirrors I moved down the road about 6-10 feet and it took about two more steps  As we were having our coffee I was looking off into the woods behind our home and saw a tall pitch black ""ape"" walking from south to the north Hair on arms and head approx 8 inches hanging down face was facing forward then head turned when I was about 10 feet away and it looked in my direction face was flat ape like.  I joked to myself ""baby bigfoot""  Later, I remembered your website and that Bigfoot/Sasquatches have been known to vocalize similar screams.  The latest ""event"" and the reason that I reached out to MM, was because my dad had our kids over at his house on Monday (5/14) evening.  Earlier that day, he had taken a few panoramic pictures of his backyard as he was playing with his dog.  My kids went over to his house around 7pm.  He had them outside most of the evening, in and out, and then they ate dinner.  Sometime around 9pm, my dad noticed a very large limb sticking straight out of the ground on the bank of the river. He looked back at the picture he took earlier and the stick was not there. The stick is probably around 9'-10' tall.  It was in the ground approximately 9"".  I have attached two pictures showing this.  I am in the picture, and I am about 5'6"".   My husband got to my dad's house about 15 minutes after my dad noticed the stick.  He started walking down to the stick, and had a very uneasy feeling, and only made it half way between the house and the river, when he heard a rustling sound in the woods across the river. That was when he turned around and walked back to the house.  I got to the house about 15 minutes after that, and my husband and I walked down the the stick to look for footprints and found nothing.  My husband mentioned that he did not have the uneasy feeling that time.  We looked around and tried to see if maybe the limb had fallen from the tree, and while this is a possibility, I feel it is very unlikely.  The conditions would have had to be perfect for this to happen.  My dad said the next morning, that he thinks that the limb probably fell from the tree, but I'm not convinced. I never told my parents about these encounters until a couple of years ago when they finally informed me that they had seen the footprints in the snow back in 79' and called someone to look at them I believed there was a bigfoot in that area  I made it up to our cottage and told my family but everyone just laughed and to this day when I tell the story of how I have seen big foot nobody believes me I could see in the lights from inside my garage that it was at least as tall as I (6'+) and was a brownish color I do recall that some of the hair on the body was rather long about 10 inches and I could see it move as the creature walked away Im not sure what I saw it could have been a wounded bear that was hit with an arrow that couldn't use its front legs( I didn't see any blood) but it was upright and it looked like a "" Bigfoot"" . It was dark reddish with some grey in it about 3-4 inches long  I will tell you, there is more than one type of ""bigfoot"" living out there, the larger more reported, and a smaller not so reported Bart Frank's testimony: Shortly after arriving at our camp site Dennis found a foot print  (Just for FYI reasons to there is a meat packing plant across the road from the entrance to this trailway.) We crossed the bridge, and started hearing this “crying” noise that made the hair stand up on the back of my neck  As it walked, it walked primarily on it's back two legs, using also it's front right hand, which caused a sort of rolling gait to it's stride Probably 2 feet taller than an average man It was upright but I don't recall seeing legs, although my light was at the upper portion of it At the time I thought about stopping and looking for foot prints but was afraid of asking my wife if she saw what I thought I had just seen so I moved on She didn’t see any skin other than the dark gray in its face (the 1st girl) A few seconds later, a second set of feet (me) and then this ""ape"" came down the path and stopped in front of her He was very quiet and his eyes were very gentle  It traveled about twenty feet in my view The following is a letter written to The Mining Journal in May of 2008: ""BIG FOOT, Lock Ness...?"" A few weeks ago in your Sunday editorial page you ran a letter in reference to 'Bigfoot' Loch Ness Monster, etc., which I am sure some people might think is out of the question for anywhere in the U.S., let alone in the great Upper Peninsula But now I,m pretty sure what i heard was a bigfoot.  He called me down there and there was a very large human shaped foot print where the sand met the grassy area I saw on one walk an animal of tall stature, peaking out from underbrush, the head between five and six feet in height from the ground and the body was hidden  What I did see is this, whatever was in the woods followed me back to my car, I did not see it directly but it was about 35 yds standing behind some heavy swail, I could see the form, it was on two legs, quite broad and about 8 ft tall He finally spurted out ""I just saw a bigfoot!"" I glanced down at the snow-covered ground near my friend's foot and immediately all the hair on my head and neck stood at attention  Just before the banging stopped there was a glimpse of something dark that couldn't be identified However, now I know there are different varieties of ""bigfoot"", and in fact my sighting looks very similar to the drawing on the cover of the ""Legend of Boggy Creek"" video  Then after about 20 feet it stops and a few seconds later we both hear a tree getting just ripped down with force  I told him yeah we saw a dam bigfoot, and I don't think I have ever run so fast or strong since, not even when I was in the marines bears usually drop to all fours to run and they have short front legs that don't ""swing"" The thing was quite tall, and very broad across the chest While sno-mobiling in a remote area of the county in which I live, I noticed somewhat ahead of me something had walked and left this trail of foot-prints or tracks in the snow We often heard it screaming at night and supposedly the DNR cast foot print molds of it in the area My gut tells me it was not a bear my head tells me it wasnt a ""bigfoot"" sorry if this story isnt what your looking for. Now, I'm six foot 230lbs and don't scare easily, and cant explain the feeling that came on me A bare-foot giant had walked through there it seemed as though it turned from us to the direction it was going into the woods and with just a few long strides it was gone It was just getting dark It wasnt that tall about 5'6-5'7, ran across the street near Hiawatha National Forest 10 miles or so before Brimley Mi Arms were larger than legs  At first I thought it was deer, not giving it much thought, but then I realized it was probably a good four feet taller than the mid-size car in front of me  There really wasn’t a neck and when it moved its legs just seemed to float forward without any obvious effort  He was sitting on his behind with his legs bent up and his arms were wrapped around his legs She says that she was at the top, just below the path, when a set of little feet ran by It was probably 3 feet tall and dark gray in color  The legs had haunches similar to a dog it was very large, tall and dark brown He slammed on his brakes and this large animal on 2 legs bent at the waist looked right at us, 3 to 4ft  It stood around I would say between 7'-8' feet tall and it's arms were unusually long  I snapped a couple shots of it, and I stood where it was and determined the height to be around 8-81/2 feet tall I told them what happened and also told them that my friend was still in the woods.One of the Officers unsnapped his holster but did not pull out his gun.At this time it was dark we walked into the woods looking for my friend.After a short walk we could see his flashlight My companion let out a gasp and immediately ran away, and at 1st I froze, but then I just smirked and thought, ""I get it, this is a joke, the kid got us up here, now he's got a friend who's trying to scare us."" The creature was about 4 feet tall, and had massive shoulders like a football player with their shoulder pads on Me and my cousin were looking for a place to go coyote hunting and we came into this field and about 3/4 of the way across the field we saw the tracks and there they were, we took pictures of them and the stride was as long as I am tall Well, I have an honest to God true story to tell, and then let your readers decide how possibly there might be a Bigfoot in our very own area  It was getting dark and I had heard some noises (not uncommon for dusk with all the animals in there) to the NE  The sun was shining bright and it's reddish brown hair really stood out  Third, and most puzzling, was that the figure was dark, dirty rusty, red from top of head to bottom of foot except for the face which was jet black I was standing there and I heard very heavy footsteps in the dried leaves Up until now I was a non-believer in Bigfoot In retrospect and after seeing a Bigfoot creature in 2001, and reading numerous reports on the Web, I am thoroughly convinced that I had an earlier encounter with one or more of these creatures in 1974  About twenty or thirty feet directly in front of me there was a very loud and piercing scream that made me jump completly out of my skin My 1st thought was that a mini bike was coming towards us on the trail, but when I looked up, I saw this ""thing"" standing 8 feet or so in front of me, facing us, and realized the sound was growling As I studied it, I realized I could see veins, tendons, hairs coming out of skin  It slowly stood, somewhat hunched, like it was trying to stay low to the ground, I instantly realized it was walking on two feet like a human  For all these years I have assumed it was a very large bear, but could never explain how it could run through those woods in such a straight line at a speed of a man running, and I have wondered if a bear could make the rhythmic ""thump, thump, thump"" sound of footstep crashes I assumed it was a bear but there was no “woofing” or jaw “popping” both of which I have heard before and I don’t believe the dog would have backed down after treeing and chasing a few already I don’t know if this was a big foot or not it is near some of the other sightings on your web page (I had no idea there were big foot sightings in Michigan) so I figured I would share my story  I’m not a big foot believer I believe in the possibility but I’m still skeptical   At the time I didnt think a bigfoot would live around here and just went on my way This is in the Whittemore Area, and I looked down the river and then this big giant apelike creature looked out over the river at me and literally scared the crap out of me it had really long hairy arms and big broad shoulders and the head on this thing was way bigger than a human I never saw it move it was just there all of a sudden.It was very Tall about 7-8 ft She only remembers the arms swinging, the grunting, and hairy hands and feet I was climbing the path up into the dunes with another girl, and as the path was steep, I was looking down to watch my footing  I looked in the direction his head was turned and to my surprise, I saw a tall white animal coming towards us at a quick speed The creature was defintely large, bipedal, hairy, and crossed in front of us approximately 75-100 feet in at an incredible rate of speed and corresponding grace He estimates that it was around 8 feet tall (he said his impression of it made him feel short  The length between the strides I would estimate to be between 45 to 50 inches the interesting thing was that the tracks were clean in that there were no drag marks  just a clean stride  I could see a funny flat face (no snout, this was not a bear, it looked apelike..we had seen bears playing in the city dump so we knew what they looked like) with a pug nose, a low forhead, arms that looked long (resembled a praying mantis) and long legs crossed like people sit cross legged nothing I ever heard, lasted about 10 to 12 seconds om first long scream/howl,,,,,,, WEDNESDAY : am, discussed what happened in am at 4:20 determined it was bigfoot and length, distance and intensity of the owl/scream......in pm met with bigfoot expert and had lot of answers to questions.....  I seen something like a extremely tall male run across the road in front of us The first time I saw it I wasn't sure that I wasn't sleepy or my eyes playing tricks on me This thing's leg was at least as tall as me  A bigfoot?  It couldn't be, but it had to be Maybe 7 to 8 feet From the massive shoulders, it narrowed into a relatively small waist with short (comparatively)stocky legs bent at the knees, and big feet We went out later than usual so it was completly dark outside, a moonless night save a few lightpoles  The bigfoot stepped over the barbed wire fence, coming from the west, and then stepped over the fenceline on the north, the direction the deer went THERE WERE SMALL TREES THAT HAD GROWN TALL ALONG THE ROAD BEFORE YOU GET TO THE PAVEMENT.THEY KIND OF TURNED IN TOWARDS THE ROAD AND CASTED A SHADOW ON THE ROAD I have seen both and a bear does not run on two legs across the road I watched the eyes then disappear, so we walked back to the cottage It was the left foot Again while swinging my tracker my coonlight in the direction of the antenna I noticed in the spruce a set of eyes next to the deer run on this ridge About 2 years ago, sometime during warm weather, my husband and I were sleeping with our window open.  It was very early morning, and my husband was startled awake by a very high pitched screaming sound.  I was awakened just a few moments later by the same sound.  It sounded like a terrified woman, or a child's high pitch scream.  My husband was very scared, as he thought it was our 3 year old daughter that had climb out of her window and was walking on the dark road.  He ran downstairs to check on her and found her and our 2 year old son asleep in their rooms.  While he was checking on them, I heard the scream again.  My husband and I had never heard that sound before.  It gave us chills.  The next day, curiosity got a hold of me.  I started searching online for that sound, and came across supposed Bigfoot screams.  It sounded the exact same.  We even looked up screech owl noises, and many of the other noises that people have said this scream is.  Although the noises came close, nothing matched exactly, except the supposed Bigfoot screams IT CROSSED THE ROAD IN ONE STEP! IT LOOKED TO BE ABOUT 9-10 FEET TALL! AT THE SAME TIME IT WALKED ACROSS THE ROAD RICK HAD SLAMMED ON THE BRAKES IN HIS PICK-UP TRUCK I also remember looking for hair samples, but to no avail It looked a lot like of the reggae/rhasta type hair styles but not completely covering the body but just various strands of it throughout (maybe shedding from winter??) A smaller than you normally hear of, lighter in color, Bigfoot was there I could see a good four feet of legs that were about seven inches around but it wasn't up to where the thigh gets big  It's face looked like a monkeys, with wide eyes, two nostrils were visible, nose flat, it's mouth was like a slice - going straight across it's face  Ahead to my right a massive figure was stepping out of the woods and at first I thought it was a huge bear but it was walking on its hind legs It was just getting dark out and she had her headlights on As I passed it put its arms down to its sides and stepped into the woods and it was gone I turned to say something to her and when we both looked back strait ahead on the road ahead, I saw a tall ""thing"" literally take two steps and it was accross the road  I don’t know if it was a Bigfoot, trees cracking in the cold, or Bigfoot hunters knocking to each other, but I certainly know what I heard It was approximately 7-8 feet tall, black and hairey and looked like it had an ape face with its mouth open as he passed by I soon realized the dog had struck a bear or bobcat track as she had chased and treed both (in the area and never chased trash deer coyote etc..) and was covering ground quickly in a circle so we decided to intercept the dog on the next trail by the time(around 10 thirty) we got ahead of the dog she had treed whatever she was chasing about a mile south of the road( I don’t know the name of it there is a hunting pen and an oil well on the end of it) so we set off unarmed with two lights nearly dead after about a half mile whatever she was chasing took off again this time easterly assuming it was a bobcat I shut the lights off and stood silently (a bobcat will jump tree and run if it sees a light coming) the dog promptly treed or/bayed the animal it was chasing again about a mile away we headed that way using the lights sparingly again the animal ran after repeating this another two or three times we finally closed the gap to about 300 yards when suddenly  the dog went silent and ran straight  to us (without calling she wouldn’t come if I called I never could call her off a trail EVER!) tail between its legs whimpering I thought this was odd because the dog had fought bear coon and bobcat and never backed down or lost I didn’t think much of it I was glad to have her back so we could go so I  just leashed the dog and started back out we were less than disorientated because of the long twisting turning chase and no moon and to make matters worse the lights died and we had no cell service! after about an hour of walking in what I thought was the right direction I began to hear something big trailing slightly behind and to the left me I stopped and asked my friend if she had heard any thing she admitted she had but didn’t want to admit it for fear of me picking on her  we continued and so did the trailing I kept throwing the dim dead light back in the direction of the animal each time the brush would crash and limbs high I don’t know how high but higher than a deer could reach and only a large bear on its hind legs could move or break would react to something fleeing the light before it would die out again after a couple seconds the dog continued its unusual behavior (tail between its legs and skittishness)especially when the animal began circling us we would hear it then it would be silent and a leaf would crunch a head of us I would shine the light in that direction and the sound of heavy pounding feat and big 3 inch around trees would break and shake then the light would go dead The whole time I felt as if something large and intelligent was observing us sizing us up the hair on the back of my neck was standing up and shivers ran down my spine the whole incident lasted an hour or 2 we never saw the animal but heard it circling us and breaking huge limbs trees 2 to 3 inches were being broken within fifty feet of us and less and we never saw the animal just the vegetation around it broken or moving after it fled our light for a brief moment before the light would die I am convinced I experienced the all elusive Bigfoot  I BELIEVE TO THIS DAY THAT IT WAS A BIGFOOT THAT WE HAD ENCOUNTERED THAT NIGHT  My mind raced after I saw this looking for the logical answer of what this could be…..and the only thing it could have been was a Bigfoot THURSDAY;  woke up and someone noticed bones about 30 feet away And now reflecting on its body shape and height and the way it walked I know it wasn't human because this thing was at least 9 or 10 ft tall, if not bigger Over the years I've played this over in my head and the only thing I can come up with is that that for a brief instant I was talking to a bigfoot who didn't want to talk back.  When I went to examine them there were a lot of drag mars left by me  and a few slips in the deep snow, my stride fell short by some 20 or so inches as I tried to match the stride I was awakened by a strong odor.When I opened my eyes I saw a huge creature only 3 feet away looking down at me from just outside my bedroom window.My bed was directly under and against the window,so I was looking up and this thing blotted out most of my view.I ran to my parents room as this thing let out what I can only describe as a mix of a roar and a scream.This woke my mother,sister,a dog inside and a dog out on our porch.The dog outside was barking and growling as I grabbed a .44 revolver There is an area by a large rock cliff called Sugar Loaf mountain hiking area, north of this area along the road on the opposite side of the road is Wetmore Pond area is a ""boggy"" marsh, a large animal that was covered in brownish/red fur head to toe, long arms and long strides walk/ran fast across the road, stood up on the guard rail and leap down on the other side of the guard rail This road had one little property light up by the intersection, otherwise it was dark except for the small amount of light from the tractor and trailer backup flood lights I was totally aware of such a creature as Bigfoot back then, even through I don’t recall us saying it was “bigfoot”  It was covered in dark hair and was taller then any bear i have ever seen Possibly this was a young  bigfoot because it was not lumbering but cruising through the woods at full stride like a bigfoot track star.It was alot of years before I went back in the woods much. we turned off of that road to go to deckerville road and as we turned a corner my headlghts caught a large dark object ""run"" across the road When we came around a bend and our head lights hit an animals eyes glowing back, the driver being an avid hunter, backed up to inquire The event happened so fast that for a few awkward seconds I was totally absorbed in stunned silence  It had long (possible 4 to 5 inches) reddish, dark brown to black hair but had a monkey / humanoid face that was much lighter (not white but not black like a monkey)  It sat on the limb (no tail visible) as a human would squat on the ground so that really got me thinking and so erik and i were standing there discussing this whole thing not beliveing that it was real and not even 5 minutes after talking a huge tree across the road and down a little bank about 20 feet from us started shaking violently and the snow was falling off it and branches breaking so erik started running back towards the car and i followed  I always figured that what people were seeing was bears walking on there back legs Up until that moment, bigfoot had not crossed my mind at all I never saw any eyes or face  The creature seemed to be afraid of me as it jumped in the weeds leaving only its legs exposed The sound of the foot steps were very heavy and we could hear branches breaking as it moved around (We each weighed about 150 to 160 pounds.) It was a right foot and there were no claw marks whatsoever ahead any of the five toes, as a bear track would exhibit  Also, there is an account of an Ontonagon logger who claimed that 2 bigfoots rescued him from under a fallen log With no tracks, the form taller than a bear even on hind legs would be  It's face appeared hairless, while the rest of the body was covered in longish light colored hair (whitish) with a darker tone on it's back After the picnic was over, Jeff’s cousin drove us back home, and I was thankful for the ride, as I was not comfortable walking back through the woods that evening, as it was getting dark We only found 1 set of tracks so I am not sure if what we found are bigfoot tracks across.It was standing on 2 legs straight up  Just the banging and a glimpse of something dark that had apparently set that branch down as we were able to see it had been leaned up against the tree as the trail circled around that area  It's arms were long and just kinda swinging loosely as it passed A friend and I were Bowhunting in October of 2000 or 2001.We found the area we wanted to hunt the day before.We hiked into the woods together.He chose a spot down by the creek over looking a small swampy area.It was down a deep ravine.I continued on further down the path and found a spot and sat down in the tall grass.Neither one of us had a tree stand  I couldn't tell what it was, all that I could see was the reflection of the eyes, a red reflection, I thought nothing of it, thought it was an animal and kept going, I was running at about 80MPH the stride on it also was very far apart , i walked in the snow next to it and i had to seriously spread my legs out far just to come close to the stride of these prints   Lately I have tried to understand what happened, and have only recently wondered if it was a large Bigfoot  It was completely dark and I never saw anything. The print was a foot & a half long and 6 inches or so wide, and a couple inches deep  The hair around its head sort of drooped down on the sides It was around 8 feet tall long arms with fingers, barrel chested and pot bellied Whatever that was following us would only move at strategic times when my friends would get a bit too loud or started scraping their feet on the road  (It was very male because of its wide shoulder to slim waste shape)  Second, he appeared to traverse the steep down hill slope like a down hill skier attacking the slope in parallel skier motions but in very long foot steps instead of sliding skies in downhill parallel motion As we started to leave the wooded area behind us we both clearly heard a grunt 20 feet behind us  At first I just watched closely in that direction wondering what the heck was that?  And then caution set in, as like I said I had never heard anything like that,  I hunt with a Krag 30-40, so I took the safety off and wrapped my thumb around the bolt to prevent accidental discharge and then I was going to wait for dark,  but again caution told me to get out of the swamp,  then butterflies set into my stomach because of the unknown and I had the urge to run,  but I refused as I have been in the woods most of my life hunting and know that running will set off a chase with a predator, so I walked slowly and constantly rubber necking to see if I could see anything, I didn't My brother was driving home in the approximate area of  (removed), Monroe, Michigan in a Geo tracker passing sporadic farm houses and other homes otherwise it was pretty dark  I'd guess it was about six and a half feet up the tree you could see it  When it squinted at the light, it's eyes and forehead became clear  I estimated from where the creature stood to where I last saw it on the edge of the trail/swamp was about five feet I was getting ready to take a bath and I saw a huge shaggy typical bigfoot looking thing standing outside the bathroom window  IT was totally silent, with no noises even though he was running through the trees, and in a very heavey blue berry patch area Also some odd calls were let out before the chase in the dark....like nothing I had ever heard When it walked you could hear the sticks and leaves cracking under its feet  The wrinkled expression of squinting it's eyes, creating folds and / or wrinkles that went all the way up it's forehead before the hair  He was covered in fur, from his head to his feet I watched a tall dark brown bipedal creature around 7ft tall cross my road to my side and enter my woods  I saw bigfoot At first we figured it was nothing but then after hearing Cliff scream on Finding Bigfoot we figured we heard a Bigfoot Up North so we thought we should report it. The next day I picked out another site not far from the trailer, a fairly large clearing a few hundred feet in diameter (the forest was a mix of hardwood and evergreen, if I recall) with a wide easement for power lines that had been cut into the woods that ran directly in front of the blind that I had set up under a tree ( I think that power line easement figures into what happened but at the time I had no idea of its significance)  I put my foot in the track and it fit but it was just much bigger  That was the last we heard of those noises until recently.  The current situation is actually happening at my dad's house, which is about 2 miles if you take the road, and maybe 1-1.5 miles straight shot, from our house.  He moved to that house about 3 months ago.  A few weeks or so after he moved into the house, he told me one morning that he heard this screaming sound the night before that he had never heard before, and that it gave him chills.  I jokingly said that it was Bigfoot.  Well, one day I was watching Finding Big Foot at my dad's house, and he heard the sound that the cast had heard in the woods, and MM said was a Bigfoot.  He came into the room and said, ""that's the sound I heard, what was that?""  -He did not know the name or content of the show I was watching it was very warm that day and even that night was pretty nice so i kept telling myself there is no way that its a bigfoot print and was telling myself that maybe the snow had melted a bit and made a footprint look larger but then i realized ok thats silly because its an actual FOOT print , clear as day and why would someone walk around the snow in bare feet and who would have feet that are that big  And at that time, I had never heard of bigfoot  Now, I am about six foot tall and have a three foot stride...what ever I saw would have to be considerably larger than me He was about 11 feet tall, covered in dark red short fur with red type highlights, it was clean fur, and somewhat neat and orderly The arms were longer than would be proportionate for a human, hung down to it's knees, and the hands were long and large My parents were not home and it was dark outside  No pointed head, eyes brown, not a snout What we had seen is was what to this day we describe as a ""baby"" bigfoot  First, it was male and it was extremely tall, maybe 8 to 9 feet in height I cannot describe how big this creature was, how long its arms were and how fast it moved and disappeared into the woods  I'm convinced that what I saw was too tall, was not clothed naturally, and moved too unnaturally to be a human.  The creature was upright, approximately 4.5 to 5 feet tall, moved extremely fast on two legs, and was completely covered in hair But of the the years I have been thinking about it and seeing your show and the people seeing them in Michigan I am now really believing it was a bigfoot  It sounded identical to the Klamath Screams I heard on the Oregon Bigfoot website  After the car came to a stop, I looked up after the smoke cleared and there it was, this thing was approximately 11 feet tall, fairly slender, his hands reached down to his knees It actually looked GROOMED! The hair was all over it's body and it was brownish with silverish tips  To any one looking my feet would have been a blur It was dark brown, about 7 ft He said he saw a large dark figure walking south through the woods  WHEN WE GOT TO THE CAR EVERYTHING LOOKED ALRIGHT SO WE DECIDED TO LOOK AROUND THE AREA AND THAT IS WHEN WE FOUND A HUGE FOOTPRINT ON THE DIRT ROAD (IT WAS A SANDY AREA) AROUND SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN INCHES LONG ABOUT 7 INCHES ACROSS AND IT LEFT A DEEP IMPRESSION, WE WERE LIKE BIGFOOT Never knew what it was until on your site and was listening to sounds recorded of bigfoot  The branch was about nine feet high I never associated this event with bigfoot until a few days ago as I was reading a few bigfoot sighting reports on the net, merely as a lark, and was amazed at how similar some of the sounds reported fit the description of what I heard that night about 30 feet or so behind a large cedar tree I could make out what appeared to be a a face which was defintly not a bear but not a man either The stump had a domed top and was at least 5 to 6 feet (in the sitting position)tall It's body was like a gorillas, I could see a face, but the flesh was dark like the fur While hunting in the Pinckney State Recreation Area during the last week of deer season my hunting partner and I heard loud whooping or howlling type noises similar to those heard in recordings on this site along with bi-pedal type foot steps through heavy brush  Long black hair fluttered in the wind off the stump!! Then sis said that it looked like an old Indian sitting cross legged and covered with black long hair Well I jumped from my chair and threw off the blanket I had on my legs and stared right at it for a second and then realised my front door wasn't completely shut and locked We stood there looking out into the dark for what seemed like 20 min or so then the sound started moving away deeper into the woods  My father ran outside with a gun to shoot it, and could not locate it in the dark All I could really make out were the eyes, They were almost aglow, of course this must be from the sunlight shining down since the sun was at our backs I need to have a conversation with him about bigfoots in West Michigan  We needed a place to consume said contraband without the prying eyes of the local police department that knew my two friends quite well But it was not on 4 legs  I remember also it was very still/quiet that night while on foot I have heard some of the bigfoot sound recordings and have to say that some of them are very similiar to what we heard that night The fluid motion of the creature stunned me and I only managed to turn on the parking lights before it took two strides and passed directly in front of the car of snow along with the trees so I could make out this dark silouette very well About a half hour before dark I heard a loud scream just off to the north of me, I had never heard a sound like that before in the woods, a minute later a branch was broke off a tree in the same direction, it was not a small branch as it cracked loudly  Here was this being, maybe 5 feet in length, dark black-brown, four-footed, running on all fours (not running like a bear runs, I've seen that too), with its underbelly about 2 feet off the ground Up until this time I had never believed in bigfoot or sasquatch Hi, This is really wierd for me, and I have no idea if BigFoot even exists and have never in my life considered that it may After 30 minutes of calling I stand up to sign the field edge and when I sign I see 2 huge glowing eyes like a yellowish bright color I’ve never seen before and it was high enough off the ground my first thought was the land owners put a reflective sign in a tree Several years later, a few of us discussed this sighting, and those who aren't necessarily believers in Bigfoot had no explaination as to  what we saw  I was by myself and in my favorite spot that I had picked out when I was about 14, I usually go in before daybreak and don't come out until dark, pack a lunch with me I’m guessing it must have been 8 feet  I thought it was a germiln or a baby bigfoot  We didn't know about bigfoots back then At this time my passenger was looking west (right side of vehicle) and said ""Holy s#!t what is that!"", by the time I looked there was only a large dark upright blob already in the tree line, so I did not get a good look, but my passenger swears it was a sasquatch Approximately 20 feet in front of me  WE LOOKED AROUND SOME MORE AND FOUND ANOTHER FOOTPRINT BY THE CREEK  It was tall, dark, two-legged, and moved very fast I walked into the trees, and crouched down behind the brush was a large, dark brown colored figure about 50 to 60 yards away Summer 1998 around 2am I saw something that looked like a bigfoot tall, with hair about 6 or 7 inches long and the face was a little lighter than the rest of the animal I was close enough to see the pupil and its eyes were bloodshot There seemed to be white hair around the face and on the chest The footprints traveled to the front of the house, around a dogwood tree and down the front yard  His eyes were very unnerving Next we heard foot steps...pacing back and forth, heavy steps that had a lot of weight behind them..deliberate to get our attention..it did all hairy, on the sides the hair was dark in color with a silverish grey top layer  We have told numerous people our story and everyone kind of just says, 'Yeah, right,' and laughes at us, but we will stake our lives on this story and we will go to our graves knowing what we saw was ""Bigfoot or Loch Ness.""  When I saw my dog, he was looking to his right and that is when I saw a figure some seven to eight feet tall  When I walked her through the event and told her that I think I saw a Bigfoot she just laughed and continues to laugh at me today Long brown matted hair with a blond tint here and there It was 8 - 9 feet tall and had black hair  It turned away from her and in one jumped- jumped 10 feet into the swamp"
Minnesota," My friend and I were totally silent and listened again tall It didnt pump its arms when it ran like a sprinter does The grass was laid out flat in some areas and I noticed the steps were short for someone that size, we were thinking that he was hurt as there was only a right foot print and every so often the grass would be laid flat, like he was falling down. As we are sitting by out fire we both saw a set of eyes staring at us But what i remember from then was seeing the out line of a dark colored figure The strides in the tracks and depth of the snow convinced us that they were not made by man, but were similar to man's walk  It was covered in dark brown fur was 6-7 ft tall My folks had installed another van seat in the van that faced out the back window  It was on 2 legs standing up, very tall, every bit of I would say 8 foot, and walking in very huge strides, swinging it arms, making alot of noise Until that day I was a avid hunter of everything and never thought there was a thing like this out there and now seeing and hearing whatever that was I quit hunting have not been in the woods much since, and never near there at dark. I think it took him totally by surprise I had just left my truck and headed down into the woods, checking out a large rock/over-hang formation when something moving to my right (southwest) about 175-200 feet away, caught my eye  Its feet were covered with long hair like a clydsdale horse that trailed on the pavement as it crossed  bigfoot does exist.. After it was out of sight was then when we realized that no person could walk that distance in that short of time, and no person would be that tall looking that far away The legs were also long and odd looking as it walked About 7-7.5 feet tall Around four in the morning I heard heavy large foot steps coming toward our tent What I saw was a very large, man-like, reddish brown colored, hairy creature with its back towards me November 2004: I saw something big on two legs run through my yard one night Body was dark in color, almost black Just less than 20 to 30 feet away this GIANT birch tree flung back up into the air in its original upright position I saw grey to brown long hair I first saw Bigfoot a month ago or so It ran in human form and not on 4 legs  The animal was brown in color and when standing I estimate about 7 to 8 ft tall. 15 minutes after my hike,I heard a tree starting to loudly crack and fall within 20 maybe 30 feet from where I was standing still Who turned on the head lights so they did not have to dismantle the fort in the dark  My impression of it at that time was that it had sense of humaness about it, but it was a wild, unkempt, hairy creature It was like a gorilla on two legs very thick and long hair The color was a reddish brown but a bit darker on the head the hair was also shorter on the head then the shoulders, like a short hair dog, the shoulders were like wiry hair dogs kinda scraggy Neither one of us said anything about the eyes to the other until we were on our way home  It did have a peculiar way that it's arms moved when I saw it walking, and it had a cone-shaped head  I noticed a black ""head"" appearing above the pine trees (the cedars were short growing a wet lowland, I'd guess they were 6-7 feet at the time)  The head would appear and disappear periodically it was near 6 in a half feet tall or maybe 7 feet  As we were throwing garbage on the fire, I happened to look up, beyond the fire, and saw this dark, black ""figure"" deftly moving along the perimeter of the woods and suddenly duck back into the woods--at most, 100 yards away Tracks in the snow,7 feet apart 16 inches long and 8 inches wide  I saw a creature about 300 feet to the northwest of me on a hill at the edge of a mixed deciduous and evergreen forest The first thing my son said to me was its face was grayish brown no hair, but the rest of its body was covered with black hair.  We never did go and look for foot prints the next morning A bear could not walk that long on 2 legs, plus a bear does not take the strides that this creature did Maybe for the right reasons if there were people with firearms with me The arms of this beast swung long and almost like with ease right in stride with its long stride as it kept up very well with the van  I could see that he was visibly shaking and had definite ""fear"" in his eyes  I sort of talked my self out of believing what I saw because this ""something"" was not the normal brownish/red color typified of a bigfoot sighting  When I turned back I saw the back of a dark head and shoulders disappear into the hazelnut brush No noise or odors, this dark figure turned and looked at my son who looked at it for 4 to 5 seconds and then ran back to his mother to tell her what had happened I laughed and told my husband and my kids I think I just saw Bigfoot haha  so she took a flash light and shined it in the vicinty but not directly on it hoping not to spook whatever it was that was only 20-30 feet from the kids and the clothesline  Let’s be honest, when night falls, humans are severely limited in our faculties:  we can’t see in the dark—are dependent on light, and really cannot function in any remote behavior like these beings. The face had light brown skin, with no hair on it's face, but slightly deformed-looking It appeared to be about seven feet tall I saw something very tall walk through the woods I have never seen  An average person would appear taller, would look large in width because they most likely would have plenty of warm clothing and a helmet on and would appear to have longer arms down by their knees if they were reaching for the handlebars but i will tell you it was big  tall and black  Next to the woods has always been a farm field, usually grown with alfalfa and around 150 acres; leading up to the brush pile is long, tall grass with sparse trees here and there with an old barn and old house nearby (both abandoned) After calming down from this we decided to walk in the direction it headed for and found three or four very large foot prints in the creek bed area The Arms were long and swaded back and forth with each stride I know it didnt run like a mile or anything but it was almost a half mile that it did and never lost speed or footing in its steps as it chased us Moments after I crawled into bed, my wife whispered to me, ""Jim!  There is something outside the window!""  so I quietly got up and when I flipped the light switch to on, I saw three sets of eyes (each set of eyes was 5 to 8"" apart) that were somewhat orange around the periphery and vague outlines of heads were pressed against the window screen I moved around to the right a little bit to try and get a better look, when all of a sudden this thing gets up on two feet and starts running like a bat out of hell we brought a friend with us who never ""bigfoot hunted"" before but was curious about our stories It was on two feet whatever I saw took only 2 to 2 and a half strides to clear shoulder to shoulder  I then realized that any man out in the woods on opening day of deer season would have been wearing an orange hat and coat, while this one was clad in dark brown/black It had black fur and a very hairy face more like a man than a bear (It had no snout) Long arms long legs, dark black and about 7-8 ft  I shined my light down into the woods, but could not see anything as the land dropped off rather steeply into a large wooded ditch, maybe 200 feet deep  Its hard to judge the height, but it was at least as tall as a tall man  It was beginning to get dark as my friend and I took the tractor and wagon to the pile, unloaded it, and started a very big fire (with my parents’ permission) I was about 5'9"" at the time and i felt very short upon seeing this shadow next to the tree about 20 feet from me and my sister and her friend  When you mentioned the ""hitting tree sounds"" it rang a bell in ""this old man's head.""  Could it have been a Big Foot or not?  I don't know, but I just had to write about my mystery. When Jean talks about it, it raises the hair on her neck I seriously feel that we saw bigfoot that day.  It had long muscular arms and when it reached the other side of the road swung his arms and leaped the entire ditchway My husband went to the area after but there was not much he could tell on the pine needles but in the grass he could see large footprints pressed down I'm 6' tall I posted a Youtube video, ""Cass lake MN Bigfoot Vocalization site"" The hair was wire like I saw from the waist up and arms pumping  There was a shadow on two legs not more than ten feet from us running in the ditch after the van When he was next to his car he looked to the left into a growth of pines about 50 ft away and he saw a figure there that was 6-7 ft tall and not in clothing and covered in fur head to foot  I purchased the land about 8 years ago from my mom, and I spend a lot of time up there cutting wood and playing around with my kids, friends and relatives; and every time I drive by the perimeter of the woods, I think to myself, from the distance that figure had to be 7-8 feet tall, maybe taller--and quick It passed the tree and thats when I said, ""look how tall that person is."" It was about 4 feet taller than the tree All of a sudden, while laying there in our tent, I heard something huge come crashing thru the trees and run right by my head, with what sounded like bi-pedal type footsteps, only extremely fast and heavy (the ground near my head shook somewhat when it went by), with the dog right behind it  It had a broad nose with little hair on its forehead or cheeks The color was dark brown like a moose and as I tried to get a good look at it through my scope We all saw this outline of a tall man near that tree when i told the girls that there was something by that tree watching us once again with huge heavy foot steps  I wasn't able to make out too much detail as the sun hadn't quite come up over the horizon, but I could tell that it was tall and bulky with long arms and a very long stride Crossing the frozen lake was a tall man like person walking at a fast pace I tell this very hesitantly because I'm certain this will probably be ignored and maybe laughed at or eyes rolled back by you in disbelief It was 6-6.5 feet tall walking on two legs crossing a smaller road off to left walking parallel to me driving I was just relaxing when I heard footfalls in the area We looked around and there was no other traces, but we realized whatever made that footprint, also made the splashing sound and likely swam across the 100 yards of lake to pull himself out of the water At that point, Rick noticed a very large, wet footprint on the rocks by our canoes  I was certain what I had seen was a bigfoot Head was a lighter color brown with hair coming down to his shoulders  The only thing I can come up with is that we had an experience with a Big Foot It was definately on two feet I was wide awake and have no doubt about that she saw a brownish hairy manlike creature standing along the left side of highway 2"
Mississippi,"WHEN IT REACHED THE BRIDGE IT JUMPED DOWN THE BANK IN ONE BOUND AND WAS OUT OF SIGHT BUT WE COULD HERE ITS FOOT STEPS GOING SOUTH FOR SEVERAL SECONDS  I then proceeded to walk to our cabin which was only about another 75 feet away What was seen was a Hairy Animal on two feet running towards us on a wet rainy night...It was late one night about 3:00am.. Never stayed out after dark  It had to have been well over 6 feet tall, since the bushes were at least 3 feet tall WE COULD NOT TELL THE LENGTH OF ITS ARMS AS THE WERE BENT AT THE ELBOW AS IT RAN, BUT THE ELBOWS WERE PUMPING BACK AND FORTH AS IT RAN As we approached my brother slowed the truck and slightly turned to shine what it was.The thing was about six feet in height had long brown hair on its head and down his shoulders.the face was dark and we were unable to make out features  She pointed out what appeared to be something dark beside a large cypress tree I don’t go hunting before daylight and I come in before dark I AM SIX FEET TALL SO I ESTIMATE THE ANIMAL AT EIGHT AND HALF TO NINE FEET TALL near the town of Batesville,Miss.A big foot was spotted on a country road on Oct OUR EYES HAD NOT ADJUSTED TO THE DARKNESS AND WE COULD NOT SEE WHAT WAS MAKING THE NOISE There was only natural light, but the thing was only about twenty or thirty feet away and I can still remember it vividly She said it was looking over her back fence, which was six foot tall, and she could see it's head and shoulders above the fence We both came to the conclusion that it had to be a bigfoot THE ANIMAL WAS RUNNING ON TWO LEGS, IT WAS COVERED IN GRAYISH BLACK HAIR, IT WAS EXTREMELY WELL MUSCLED, WE COULD SEE THE MUSCLES RIPPLING AS IT RAN, THE DITCH IT WAS RUNNING IN WAS TWO AND HALF TO THREE FEET DEEP AND MY EYES WERE LEVEL WITH THE BACK OF ITS HEAD Scared the Hell out of us.I don't know what else it could have been if not a bigfoot. The creature appeared to be at least 7 feet tall, humanoid and completely covered in brown hair This creature looked to be about 8 ft tall.. This is my only ""bigfoot"" story, though I have a couple of others that may spark some interest, one of which defies any rational explanation. He was driving.I spotted gold eyes to the left side of the road about eighty yards in front and ten yards off the road FIRST I WILL SAY THAT A CREATURE REALLY EXIST WITHOUT A DOUBT.I HAVE NOT DISCUSSED THIS WITH MANY PEOPLE BECAUSE IT WOULD DO NO GOOD.IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND SOMEONE MUST EXPERIENCE A ENCOUNTER PERSONALLY.IT WAS NOV 28TH 1978 OR 79.I REALLY LIVE TO DEER HUNT AND SEASON HAD BEEN OPENED A WEEK OR SO.I WAS NOT OLD ENOUGH TO DRIVE AND JUMPED AT A CHANCE TO GO HUNTING WITH A COUPLE OF MY BROTHERS OLDER FRIENDS.WE ARRIVED TO THE AREA OFF OF BUNKLY RD IN KNOXVILLE WELL BEFORE DAYLIGHT.THE HIKE TO OUR INDIVIDUAL STANDS WAS APPRX1-1-1/2 MILES.ONE OF THE MEN LEFT US WHEN WE PASSED HIS STAND.ME AND THE OTHER MAN CONTINUED ON UNTIL WE REACHED HIS STAND.HE THEN INSTRUCTED ME OF SOME GOOD BUCK SIGN THAT HE HAD FOUND IN A CREEK BOTTOM ABOUT 300YDS AWAY.IT WAS STILL DARK AS I CROSSED A SMALL FIELD TO TAKE A STAND IN THE FAR TIMBER.HALF WAY ACROSS THE FIELD AN ERRIE FEELING OF BEING WATCHED CAME OVER ME.I STOPPED AND SHINNED THE FLASHLIGHT SCANNING THE TREE LINE BUT SAW NOTHING.I CONTINUED MAYBE 100 YDS INSIDE THE WOOD LINE AND FOUND A LARGE TREE THAT WOULD BE SUITABLE FOR A BACK REST.I SETTLED IN TO WAIT ON DAYLIGHT.IT WAS VERY COLD AND THE FROST FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE MADE THE FALLEN OAK LEAVES IMPOSSIBLE TO MOVE IN WITHOUT MAKING TREMENDOUS NOISE.AS ABOUT 9 AM I SPOTTED A DEER ON A SMALL KNOLL ABOUT 75-80 YDS AWAY.HE WAS MOTIONLESS STARING IN MY DIRECTION.I REMAINED STILL BUT THE DEER TURNED AND BOLTED AWAY AND INTO A THICKET AWAY FROM ME.THERE WAS A STEADY BREEZE IN MY FACE SO I KNEW HE COULD NOT HAVE SMELLED ME AND I HAD NOT EVEN BLINKED.WHILE I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED I BEGAN TO HEAR HEAVY BREATHING BEHIND ME BUT IT WAS NOT CLOSE.HOWEVER IT BEGAN TO GET LOUDER AND LOUDER.LOOKING OVER MY LEFT SHOULDER I COULD SEE MY SHADOW THE SHADOW OF THE TREE I WAS SITTING AGAINST AND THE SHADOW OF A LARGE UP RIGHT CREATURE DIRECTLY BEHIND ME.STARTLED I QUICKLY JUMPED UP AND SIDE STEPPED BACK AND AWAY FROM THE TREE.NOT 5 FEET AWAY STOOD A CREATURE LOOKING AT ME.HE WAS COVERED WITH MEDIUM LENGTH PINE STRAW COLORED HAIR.HIS FACE DID NOT HAVE ANY HAIR ON IT.HIS ARMS HUNG DOWN TO HIS KNEES AND WAS AT HIS SIDES.HE HAD SUNKEN COAL BLACK EYES.HE STOOD AROUND 7 FT TALL AND I COULDN'T GUESS HIS WEIGHT.WE MADE EYE CONTACT FOR ONLY A COUPLE OF SECONDS AND I WAS IN STRIDE VACATING THE AREA LEAVING ME GUN BEHIND.I YELLED THE WHOLE TIME I WAS RUNNING.ONE OF THE MEN WITH ME HEARD ME YELLING AND WAS IN THE FIELD WHEN I RAN OUT OF THE WOOD LINE.HE ASKED WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND I TOLD HIM.WE WENT AND GOT THE OTHER MAN AND WE RETURNED TO RETRIEVE MY GUN.THEY LAUGHED AND PICKED AT ME UNTIL WE REACHED THE TREE WHER MY GUN LAID.IN THE LEAVES BY THE TREE WERE VERY LARGE TRACKS.IT HAD 3 TOES AND MEASURED ABOUT 14"" LONG AND ABOUT 4-5"" WIDE.WE COULD SEE THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL THROUGH THE LEAVES.WE FOLLOWED FOR ABOUT 75 YDS NO ONE SAID A WORD.COMING TO THE CREEK WHERE THE TRACKS DROPPED OFF THE BANK.LOOKING OFF THE BANK WE COULD SEE THE TRCKS CLEARLY IN THE SAND.YOU COULD ALSO SEE WHERE THE CREATURE SLID DOWN THE SIDE OF THE DROP OFF.WE LEFT IMMEDIATELY.TO THIS DAY I HAVE NOT RETURNED TO THAT PARTICULAR AREA.THE MEN NEVER MENTIONED THIS TO ANYONE TO MY KNOWLEDGE.I HAVE SEEN MANY BEARS AND OTHER WILDLIFE BUT I ASSURE YOU AT 5FT AWAY THERE IS NO CASE OF MISTAKEN IDENTITY. It was solid black and looked to be between 4 1/2 feet tall and 5 feet tall and was running on 2 legs In 1987 as my college roommate and I were on our way home from a football game I saw a large humanoid creature that was covered with hair cross the road in front of us then stopped to look at us as we drove by It walked upright and straight on two legs Subject: White Bigfoot I just read the Louisiana encounter on your site and thought it great that someone else had seen a white bigfoot the creature seemed to be about eight feet tall and may have weighed 400 Lbs.This creature had black hair all over about 2 or 3 inches long.the face and chest area were bare.The skin seemed to be a grayish tone  Anyway, I stood there looking, trying to figure out what this white hairy thing was I slowed down the car as I got to where it crossed and I know the hair stood up on my arms It was standing with its back to a barbed wire fence in two to three foot tall sage grass It stumbled slightly at the edge of the road and swung its arms to regain balance then continued across the road and into the tree line The next morning we found very large human-like footprints in the garden In 1987, my college roommate and I were driving home from a football game where we were playing in the marching band The only thing we found the next day was a single partial footprint  It was probably 50 to 75 feet away from us, so we could not get a real good look at it After coming home from the state park I listened to wood knocking sounds on the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization website I believe that what we witnessed that night was truly bigfoot.. We were at a small pond just off the road,doing what you did back in 1979,drinking a few beers ,well we had the radio going pretty mellow for the day,when my friend Tim, whose car we were in said,did you hear that?We turned the radio down and rolled the windows down a little,listened ,nothing, so we turned the radio back up and in a few minutes We did hear something,it was a pretty loud growl,not like anything i'd ever heard before,we were on the north side of the pond and it was on the south side,there were cattails that were at least 7 foot tall on that side of the pond,Tim turned on the headlights and across the pond there was a huge hairy ape it looked like,with huge green eyes,and it was turning its head slightly from side to side,blinking its eyes,which were green only because of the headlights of course,well that got all of our attention real good, I remember asking everyone if they saw what I did,and we all agreed that bigfoot was on the other side of this real small pond,it had to be at least 8 feet tall,and had a very cone shaped head, just like a silverback gorilla,and was black as far as I could tell,it was making some grunting sounds every now and then,we cut the headlights off and cranked ths car,which chose to take a very long time to fire up,when the animal let out the most spine tingleing roar i've ever heard,kind of like a lions grunt but much louder and longer,the car fired up and we got out of there ,when the headlights came back on it was still there,I have to say it scared us so bad we didnt tell many people,but it has remained in my memory all these years,I can still hear that roar,its quite distinctive,I grew up in those woods since I was 7,always felt like something was watching me,from bicycles to dirt bikes we would ride those trails Upon approaching the damaged fence, I noticed several ""large"" footprints   The wood knocking sound I heard exactly matches the recorded wood knocking sounds on some of the bigfoot websites I thought at the time that the eyes were looking at me with curiosity or amusement  I wasn't swimming I was sitting down at the side of the water hole with my feet in the water but kind of drawn up beside me and my sister was sitting between my legs in the water It was, I'm sure, seven to eight feet tall  The face was very big, flat, dark brown almost black, eyes were black  The light was dappled through the tree cover, but we could see that it was shining off of what appeared to be hair or something with a ""hairy"" texture We continued to watch out of the window and then saw the creature stand up and run off on two legs into the woods toward the river I was terrified at the idea that I had seen a bigfoot or whatever and ran back to the house and never spoke of it to anyone (at the time).  When it looked at us, its eyes reflected the headlights of our car I do not remember many facial features as the face was obscured by some hair Untill that night, I did not know what it meant to have your hair stand on end   When I was about 150 feet from our cabin I heard a distinct knocking sound like you would get if you were hitting a 2x4 with another 2x4, or maybe hitting a 2x4 with a hammer The hair appeared straight The creature was very tall, with long arms in 1996,and never saw tracks or any sign of bigfoot,although i did know about it,and did look for tracks pretty much whenever I was in the woods,which was very often.Thanks. All of a sudden, my youngest brother ran through the group yelling ""Booger-Bear!!"" He looked TOTALLY scared to death We heard a report from Pas Christian that a woman had called the police and reported a hairy ape looking man outside her backyard, looking in her kitchen window  I heard what sounded like what I've heard the investigators on FINDING BIGFOOT do when ""callling"" to a bigfoot The creature was covered with very dark brown hair over it's entire body, with the exception of it's face The road was built up about 8 feet from the ground since it flooded back there The creature had a long stride and it's arms swung as it walked  We had been there approximately 5 minutes when we heard footsteps in the woods I asked her to describe what she had seen and she said that she had seen a large hairy man, or something running at us I would say it stood around 7 1/2-8 feet tall, and weighed about 450-500 pounds. Approximately a week later foot prints were found near Tupelo, Miss It was covered all over with dark, shaggy, brown hair and when it  looked up at us as we stood in the window its eyes glowed white in the darkness"
Missouri,"Now I'm thinking if bigfoot does exist, what a perfect time to come through this area I would appreciate it if someone can call me maybe come out here because today I went looking for signs of what it could have been and found a foot print in the gravel road just feet from where I heard all the noise the night before Several days later in the eveming, my grandaughter, grandson, and I believe another grandson were playing outside the garage door which was raised up about 3 feet  Also I don't think a bear can walk upright and take large strides To sum it up, My son's insisting he saw a very big hairy black man, the way it frightened him,the noise that night and the broken trail of brush and limbs, the smell and the elderly ladies keeping her shotgun  close at hand, I have to wonder I only got a glimpse of it for just 2 or 3 seconds but I know what I saw and it wasn't like anything I'd ever seen or heard of outside of things associated with Bigfoot. I immediately picked up a large knife and felt an almost over-whelming urge to loudly scream back into the darkness and to rush toward the sound Then last night I saw your show from the Ozarks telling about others having Bigfoot encounters with rock throwing, so I thought I would write to you The “THUMP” was the sound of something striking the side of that large plastic storage box - a sound we’d heard numerous times in the past when working around the box and accidentally bumping or kicking it He started cowering, tucked his tail between his legs, and quickly came over to hide by me It seemed hairless, but again, I can't be positive how hairless it was On Saturday night it was very much like the night before except there were no vocalizations or tree banging, just the ""night sounds"" ceasing and about 3-4 minutes later the window right next to my bed (on the outside this window is about 4 feet from the ground to the bottom of the window and the window is 2' wide and 3' tall) went completely dark as if something stood outside and blocked out the moon and stars at the window It stood close to eleven foot tall and was covered with thick matted redish brown hair  HE WOULDN'T SAY BUT HIS EYES WERE SO WIDE I COULD TELL HE WAS SPOOKED  About a week later I came out again and was walking to the door and jokingly called out ""are you there bigfoot?"" and laughed to myself  We then listened to recorded sounds from Big Foot recordings No way was that a bigfoot We locked eyes and looked at each other till I was past him  I though this was extrodinary since every previous thought that I had about bigfoot comprised of black fir Here is the best description I can give...It was between 4-6 feet tall, walking on two legs, covered from head to toe in very long white hair Individual traces could be seen clearly… and it is presumed that the marks were made by dragging hairs that hung from the legs of the creature that made the tracks Up the wooded hill I saw a reddish long haired man type of creature, approximately 7-8 foot tall running through the woods  I check this site every once in a while and decided to finally tell this story because I believe the young man saw a Bigfoot and I even had him take me out to the location  Something that looked to be around 8 foot tall, (I know as a 10-11 year old kid it was huge) came across the branch which led out of the old driveway and not running but walking briskly came directly in front the car it ran past our site..it came as close as 6-8 feet of us  From what I heard it was a sound of only 2 feet walking and was large  Got up looked out on my deck too dark to see anything sounded like it was in my backyard Now he had went over to a barn that was no longer used and had tall weeds growing all around it it's extended arm stretched maybe 2 feet in front of the hay bale, the extended leg probably 3 and a half feet the other way My brother's friend leaned over and said, did you just see that??  So, all three of us seen bigfoot that night many years ago. As I looked ahead some 70 to 100 feet and I saw this tall monkey with long legs go by under one of the lights It then had its elongated arms raised above its head and waving them from side to side, which it appeared to be alerting me that it was there Just talking about this brings goose bumps on my legs and arms It was a long way off, and as I looked over my shoulder it stepped over a four foot high barbed wire fence with out touching the wire There was a wooden fence, mostly for decoration and only about 20 feet long, that the thing walked next to He also insisted the man wasn't wearing clothes but was covered with black hair Way taller than me or my friend, who was about 6'2' And in the upper left hand corner of my yard about 25 yards away from my deer lick I saw a big figure about 7' maybe 8' tall At first I thought it was a hunter but realized it was too large to be a man 7-8 foot tall at least and probably over 600 pound ( I'm 6' 3"" and it was taller than me) Already shaken by the experience and definitely inexperienced I failed to lie something down beside the footprint to gauge the size of it At 25 yards or so stood a creature of a height between 8’ and 9’ foot tall covered in dark brown to black hair at the very edge of the tree line in full view of the spotlight It had longer, stringy hair  He went on to tell the story of how he encountered a Bigfoot when he was on a date in Chafee, Missouri He left a foot print behind and the police took a picture of it.What really sucks is no one really take us seriously on this,We all three know what we saw.We was fifteen feet at the most from it the whole time chaseing it with my truck,It ran behind a building where i couldn't drive.I went and looked in the trash can to see what he was eating.There was some trash some one threw in there that had some mcdonalds.cupcakes and a chocolate milk container in it.The bank is right across the street from where we spotted the thing.I know that theres a good chance they might have it on one of their cameras.Theres a bunch of cameras pointing all over the bank if theres footage its some good stuff. Plus it was way too tall  It was swinging it's arms a little and acted like we were not even there You could tell it was walking on two legs  The float started about mid-day and about half way through the float is was very dark and cloudy so no moon light  The animal hurriedly covered the 35 feet in front of the car and into the woods  Suddenly about 20 yards upstream to my left, a very large, very massive creature walking on two legs, stepped into the river to cross It was covered in dark hair and very muscular I saw it so clearly that I seen the expression on its face(soft looking, lighter brown hair on the face with a black nose)from a profile angle I would say it was dark brown, but the moonlight and limited visibility gave it's coat a whiteish sheen There was only about 150 feet between myself and the creature  I know without a doubt I saw a male Bigfoot Gordon is a pretty superstitious guy, so he totally froze It growled again so close my hair stood on end I told my wife get behind me after hearing the growl I pulled my glock 40 ready to fire What does that? Also the limb we thought was maybe five or six feet off the ground was more like 8 foot maybe 9 It was totally engrossed in what it was picking up off the ground 3 strides, it was unhurried As it went by us it turned its face toward us and its face was flat and hairless, but almost black, like its face had been caked with mud all its life  That's about it, except that during this short sighting, my mind went through all the possible explanations of what this could be besides a bigfoot and dismissed all of them From 10 yards (or so) away between two trees a blackish figure (8 feet tall) moved and I saw it directly for only a split second At a point on 54 between the railroad tracks that has an overpass and going west to the top of the hill at the state line my head lights caught something upright on two legs very big, very dark, step off the road to the south side, I only got a look for second but it sent chills up my back  The ground was covered by leaf clutter all around the ""farm/hunting cabin"" and I couldn't find any trace of footprints in the dry  leaves Just as I got even with it, it stood up and lifted its arms up as if making a tee like a cheerleader would It was very tall and was covered with hair We were looking right at each other, eye to eye, no more then ten feet from each other  It was dark colored and and appeard to be at least 6 or 7 feet tall what we both noted that we saw was something that was very tall and broad The sighting was related to me by my father.(the witness) A large Bigfoot type creature was seen in field Myself and 3 friends went to a game access area close to Smithville Lake where myself and several other young men had witnessed a pair of red eyes looking at us in October or November of 2011  I was startled, though, to see a set of footprints coming from the back of the house, from the woods coming straight towards us along the bank something was throwing these boulders into the water, when out of the trees came a rock straight at us and landed in the water 6 feet in front of us followed by a very deep growl and grunt The sighting occurred sometime afer dark Using a close by tree to estimate the height of the tallest At first I thought I was looking at Chimpanzees, but these things were taller and bigger than me (I was 5'6"" at 12 years old) I froze with fear, not believing my own eyes Other than when we met each other's gaze, it had it's head looking down so I could not see it's eyes or facial features well if at all Whatever we saw was taller than both Gene and I by about a good half foot. There is a small gravel bar/island that is heavily wooded about 200 feet from the edge of the boat ramp where the river forks and splits We also measured the window and discovered that the creature had to be at least 8.5 feet tall I was absolutely astounded by what I was seeing; if not for the fact that the dog was seeing it too, I would have wondered if my eyes and/or brain was playing tricks on me We had no weapons with us (just in case we would need them) and it was dark--and suddenly very eerie It's face was mostly covered in white hair as well, except for it's eyes and maybe it's mouth I would say it was 7.5'-8' tall and 350-400 pounds I would guess the source of it to be closer than 50 feet It was dark haired like a bear and I really didnt see its face I heard the footsteps coming towards me again and the time in between audible steps indicated that whatever it was was very tall, at least seven or more feet  It also was waving it arms and making a very strange noise That is how it looked my way.) I did see two eyes and a mouth, it happened too quick to get a detailed look , but I saw a face, a face that did NOT have an extended snout The outline of the body allowed me to see that his arms, shoulders, legs were extremely muscular, like that of a professional athlete  It didn't sound at all like a 4 foot creature like a deer It was probably 6:00 to 6:30 pm, but it was only late September so it was still light out at the time.There were other occurrences in this area with screams, or cries at night, the sound of crashing movement in the brush near our house, and a putrid,rotten smell that when smelled while coon hunting would cause the hound to come back to us, and they would slink around at our heels with their tails between their legs That's when I noticed what I believe was a deer between its legs It was on two legs jumped across the road and ran into the woods As the form moved up the dike it got larger and taller, it moved over the dike no more than 50 yards from me In the time it took me to blink my eyes and reopen them the shadow had passed completely across the roadway and was at the edge of the ditch, as the distance between us closed and more of the light from the headlights illuminated the shadow It was bent forward slightly, running and it was still 7-8 feet tall I heard a splash as the first bigfoot jumped in water 5 or 6 foot deep and the water was about the bottom of the rib cage  I'm not sure of the color since it was dark I noted a head by a limb that I judged was maybe 5 or six feet of the ground It had very dark brown, and/or black hair  We all laughed, but one of the new guys got real quiet and his eyes got real big and serious...then he said, in the most serious tone...that sh@% is for real!  We all got very quiet and as we calmed to listen, he told his story We returned to where I saw the creature in the morning to look for footprints, but the creeks were flooded from the storm and we found no evidence. The hair color was a brownish color with what looked like varying lengths, but very thin The next day I told my sister what I had seen that night and we discovered footprints around the house JUST A MOUND OF LONG BLACK MATTED HAIR  We both then agreed that it had to be a Bigfoot we had seen We commented to one another about the size of it's arms very massive  It was on two legs and very stalkey and the sounds it made were not like any of the ones on your web sight While traveling along Dark road skirting Monkey Mountain in NW Missouri, a tall thin creature of possibly 7' in height crossed the road in front of my vehicle And it wasn't a man either unless he had never had a shave or a haircut in his life It was getting dark by then and we didn't see or hear anything out of the ordinary except it did smell like something dead was close I did have several conversations with oldtimers from the area and heard stories of bigfoot sightings over the years, but never had the courage to ""go public"" As I jumped the gate ( I don't even think my feet touched the gate ) into the pack of dogs I didn't dare look back There was long hair at the wrists that seemed to hang down over the hands At this time I observed an unknown creature that was fully covered in extremely long (approximately eight to ten inches long), matted hair It could not have been 10-15 feet from us We crossed back to where it had been and found a large fresh footprint But I am telling you this place where the bigfoots are I will not go no if ands buts about it One of the line of tracks appeared to be smaller footsteps - presumable a juvenile - with clear toe prints showing in some of the footprints  All I know is that bigfoot exists, and I saw it She said it was a very hairy large mans leg  Then a monstrous roar came from the darkness of the woods behind us  ITS FRONT ARMS WERE LONG, MUCH LONGER THAN ITS SQUATTY REAR LEGS Some years later, I read John Green's book, ""Sasquatch, the Ape among Us"" page 394 where he described a bigfoot call and I'm sure 100% I was hearing three of them like described by John Green Evidence - Loud calls, rock/boulder throwing, footprints, displaced log in middle of lower trail, multiple incidents The rock itself was quite large and flew through the air every bit of 20 feet from the point where I first saw it Large upright primate approx 7foot height.  Whatever it was, it ran past our tent on TWO legs It's gate was long-strided, the arms were longer and I remember they swung by its sides in an ape-like manner The strides that it took were amazing, so fluid tall and 300 lbs  There we saw the largest footprint I had ever seen in my life I told them to be careful and left just before I crossed the dam I stopped to take a picture of a large footprint in the mud I invited our dog inside house and took my spot light out and I came across a large set of orange glowing eyes at least 8 foot off the ground  The whites of the eyes were reddish and its pupils were a bluish color I remember that it was not covered with long stringy hair as these things are often reported, but was very dark from head to toe.I saw it from about 60 to 70 yards away,clearly with nothing between us until it jumped the fence  The footprints came up along the side of the house and then circled around to my front window The creature had very broad shoulders and extremely long arms that hung down beyond its kneecaps It was a dark night and I heard the dogs all barking from their cages, which was not that unusual as they would do this whenever a coyote would come close or a car would drive by Especially since I read, here on your site, of other bigfoot sightings in the area.  It wasn't that big maybe 4 or 5 feet tall but it stood on its hind legs and ran off into the field Even though it was dark, you could see the outline of the figure standing upright in the faint light caused by a semi truck weigh station on the highway that crossed over to Cairo, Illinois  About 20 yards ahead, they saw a creature, frozen, looking back at them with yellow eyes I put my foot down next to the print He was a local doctor and told me he had seen giant footprints in the sand on his beach of his lake what now is this conservation lake he must have left them after he passed away All were smooth, with no pattern or marking and no break between heel and the remainder of the foot (as would be found with a boot or shoe) What I saw was at least 9 feet tall and looked as if it was 3 foot wide   My second thought was to scream and yell to notify someone else in the platoon, but I immediately quashed this idea since by the time I would be able to rouse anyone, the bigfoot would probably be in the woods by then Astounded I could not believe what I had just seen and then it was when I turned to my right there he stood 20 ft from my tree and was standing there looking at me and I remember thinking who are these black men running naked thru the woods? but wait this was a very hairy being with a type of crest on its somewhat of an oddly shaped head, black hair but thinner in spots and when we made eye contact it growled very deeply In the same motion the creature placed its left hand on the top wire of the fence, jumped and cleared the fence with both feet and disappeared into the corn  It was a clear night and it was pretty dark out at this time As I looked to my left there stood a huge Bigfoot Bigfoot standing in the middle of hwy 17 We were 2ish miles down the road when I see a huge brown object 20ish feet off the side of the road in the yard of a house that no one lived in  I am 37 now and do still believe to this day I saw a bigfoot  I got in my tent, which was a tall tent, about 10 feet tall and left my lantern on outside There was fresh planted soy in the fields and I could see this thing from head to foot It's body was covered in a brown hair, not a very dark brown though  I was about 6 or 7 years old and my younger sister and I were looking out our living room window and saw a big hairy ape-like creature walking upright  I could hear it walking along with me, just a few feet off, in the woods There are farms and residences in the area, but nothing for about half a mile due to the area's proclivity to flood I walked and fished for another 100 feet or so and was facing the water when in the trees/brush behind me I heard a deep HumphGrrrr sound As I rounded the first half of the S-curve, my headlights lit up a large, dark, sparkly/reflective object with yellow eye glow in the middle of the road I told my wife about it, she thought I was nuts for watching Finding Bigfoot too much tonight, then I read your website about a trucker in the same area seeing something on 54.  Then after a few moments the figure dashed to the next tree about 50 feet away in about 3 or 4 strides As I entered the curve my eyes caught a a large shadow as it crossed the road 50 yards in front of me  The call came less than 150 feet from the house a huge large slightly slumped big foot Our instincts told both of us that it could be a Bigfoot  I know what I heard immediately being that I google, youtube, and watch a lot of documentaries on bigfoot The only way I can describe it would be that the legs came from the hip, no flap of skin coming from the belly region to the leg to make them look bigger at the body and it seemed the bending when it ran came from the hip and knee area I have always assumed they walk on two legs all the time.  A bigfoot was on the road, looked in the direction of the vehicle, and ambled across the road into the woods  He said they were so scared, they believed the creature might be on top of their car, that they drove to a convenience store where a group of people were gathered, in the hopes that if people started to scatter, they were correct in their assumption that a Bigfoot was on top of their car Also, there was a road about 300 feet from where the thing was and also from where I was As we approached the area, what we immediately recognized to be a Bigfoot stepped out from behind a tree They then crossed the path we were about to take about 80 feet in front of me, ran down rocky, log-filled embankment, JUMPED a 10-foot wide stream, and scrabmled up the other side Hello BFRO I have something I would like to share with you I believe I have see what people and myself call bigfoot   It was about four feet tall like a baby bigfoot I did however, notice the hair on its back was considerably shorter than it was on the rest of its body  A few of them even mentioned ""bigfoot calls"", with a seriousness i dont think is telling a tall tail  I took four or five long strides walking upright then jumped the fence like a man would jump over something, rather like a great hop They were both about 11 years old at the time, and were hunting up a powerline when they saw what they thought was person, but realized it had hair on it like a gorilla, and it was shaking a fairly good sized cedar tree, which we assume it was trying to shake something out of it The stride length of the larger prints averaged 5 1/2 feet as the tracks approached the house  It still watched me and then it just dropped its hand and in about three strides disappeared into the forest Ahead of me at the end of my headlights I saw something run across the road on 2 legs i turned around and there 20 30 yards in front of me stood a huge creature at least 8 9 feet tall broad as a grizzly While laying down and preparing to go to sleep we heard foot prints coming our way from within the woods I was out early in the morning just after daylight looking for buck sign and squirrel hunting.Mainly looking for rubs and scrapes for deer hunting the upcoming season.I was on a hillside overlooking a steep canyon in rough country on the bryant creek watershed.I sit for a spell and was watching the other hillside.I was carrying a browning bottom eject 22 rifle and had planned to harvest squirrels but had passed on several in hope of not alarming deer in the area..I saw a flicker of movement on the adjecent hillside about 150 yds distance.I unlooped my Nikon binoculars from around my neck and looked over where I saw the leaves move.Even though it was late october and a cool morning it hadnt frosted yet and the leaves were mostly green.What I saw was a small sapling move.I saw black fur probably a foot sized patch through the foliage.It was standing still at this point.I thought bear or maybe a cow and was unconcerned.It finally took a few steps and I gasped when I realized it was a upright animal and covered in black fur.It was a dusky black and not shiny.It was moving parallel on the hill and angling somewhat upwards.Id say I watched it for about 10 mins and had never fuly got a look at it even through the binoculars but it finaly hit a small vehicle sized opening and It hit me I was actually watching a bigfoot.It was feeding on something on the ground I believe wild grapes that had fell out of a tree that had vines in it or maybe acorns.It would occasionally look up and listen.A car went down the highway about a half mile in the distance and it looked up and was canting its head to listen.I believe if the car had turned down the gravel road towards us it would have fled.It was only when the car went quiet a ways down the road it continued to feed.It was very large probably 7 foot plus and very broad shouldered.It elbows wasnt like humans it was pointed and stuck back like a deers front leg even when relaxed.It had a crown or slight dome on top its head.A dusky charcoal black with silver beginning at the back of the head and a ridge of fur beginning to get thicker there and widening as it came down the back.The hairs in the elbows and down the back of the leg was longer and the stripe of heavier hair down the head and back was silver tipped.It was somewhat pot bellied but not really.The upper body was absolutely massive.I wouldnt hesitate to say the animal weighed 400 lbs in the least.The nose must have been flat because it didnt make but maybe a half inch bump on its face and I couldnt see any ears at that time...The thumb on its had were more chimp like.Higher on the hand and longer.I think it had 5 fingers and there had no hair on the palms.the hairs were more tapered like claws not human fingernails.It only looked across the valley where I was one time and its eyes were brown and animal like large pupils.It hair up to its lower eyes and a wide mouth.Not much in the way or a chin and its forehead was lined deeply.I was using Nikon zoom binoculars that had 7-15x40 power and was able to see a lot of details.I kept wishing for a camera...After viewing it for Id say 15 mins I heard a vocalization very soft from higher on the hill.I never saw what made it and since I only barely caught it couldnt say how it sounded.But the bigfoot looked that way and stood up and made a return sound that almost sounded like too pieces of hard steel rod banged together.Kind of a ping sound and it walked that way.It had no tail and was very broad across the shoulders.I believe these are a unique species and are pure animal.Not in anyway related to humans.However I think their senses like smell and hearing,eyesight are very acute and they have a lot of intelligence thats why people never see them hardly.They dont want to be seen and avoid encounter with man.Never saw one before and never since.But I dont go into the woods before daylight anymore.I wait till I can see.And if mushroom hunting or looking for indian relics I carry a heavy caliber pistol.I wouldnt want the tangle with one of them period.I never told anybody about my sighting.I figured they would think I was nuts. Shortly after dark, we were all three sitting around the campfire, and heard what we thought was a deer rubbing its antlers The most striking part to me and what I remember most clearly, is that it's hair was grey, not brown My dog was with me and it was right at dark The creature/person was very dark in color, even when my lights hit him The sun had gone down and it was starting to get dark  It was dark so naturally we had the headlights on and as my uncle began slowing to pass over the rough gravel something in the corner of my right eye came into view the best way to describe it I find is to compare it to an Irish wolfhound dog on two legs, without the dog shaped facial structure) Approximately 100 feet into that other yard, the stride length of the large print tracks slightly reduced, and the smaller (juvenile) prints reappeared The legs seemed to be easily defined  We rounded a corner and were meeting a car--both of us had our headlights on -- and there in the middle of the road--standing right on the yellow line which separates the two lanes--is this ""thing.""  It was about 7-8 feet tall and covered with hair I can say that it's eyes were bigger than that of a human's and seemed very dark and then one foot from it .. The foliage on the forest floor was just as dense - someone standing just feet away could be lost to view  We had the jugs all set out and was floating down behind them, when we saw something big and hairy on the bank getting a drink The description of the hair being that it was very long and covered the whole creature, not tangled, matted, or dissarrayed, but it was a blinding white color--didn't even look dirty or yellowed                                                       It was taller than first thought 6 foot est More likely my ""instincts"" tell me it is 7-8 foot tall and 350-500 pounds I could see the reflection of the light from the kitchen in its eyes Reminds me of how the hair is on my Golden Retriever in a way Not running but, walking in big fast strides Within a few feet of starting to climb and a few minutes of being there, rocks started falling around us coming down through the trees from up above Description: Height: 7' to 7 1/2' it was very tall Width: Unknown, my view was a complete side profile view Depth: 24""-30"" easy maybe more Hair: shaggy light red/brown  It was still very dark out and the road is pretty much without street lights. It was about 8 foot tall by the trees that were there by the river The running was so significant because they ran on back legs but hunched over with long arms and it was loud At other points the smaller juvenile prints appeared to indicate that the walker had hopped repeatedly two or three times on one foot, then “jumped” or been lifted, dragging both feet for a distance of some 8 feet, and then planting one foot and resuming stride, or hopping onto the other foot The hair length on the body, at least the portions I was able to see varied, some portions were longer others shorter The rocks were at first half a fist sized, but started getting larger after that, and soon there were football sized rocks crashing through the trees around us, coming downward from above  The field was about the one and a half lengths of a football field (I am not into sports, so I cannot really tell you actual feet)  (I drove a Nissan Cube.)  Since I had slowed down and moved over, I looked back and this creature/person, had crossed the road behind me and was already over a 4 foot fence and moving quickly through the field on the drivers side It stood about 6 to 6 and a half ft tall Not wanting to shoot someone accidentally and still wanting to be safe I went back to the dog kennel and let out our red heeler who I add is usually fearless  We didn't see until it was almost to the side of the house, it was only about 100 feet away from us and we got a good look at it We both were familiar with the concept of Bigfoot, and had heard the stories of ""monsters in the woods""  The front yard had huge black walnut trees spaced about 30-50 feet apart scattered around Both lines curved, turning south close beside the house (this is the point at which the juvenile prints appear to show lifting, dragging both feet, and hopping) I grew up in the country I have hunted all my life I am not scared of any human or animal till these encounters with bigfoot I looked right into it's face and it's eyes were a deep black Myself and the passenger, as i was sitting behind the passenger, got within 7 or 8 feet of the creature through the window  Most people when they talk about bigfoot, you always get the guys who are sarcastic and snobby The only reason I know it was a tree knock is because I've studied bigfoot since I was a kid, watching stories etc and was telling everyone he had seen bigfoot and no one believed him so none of us ever made much mention to it except to family or close friends Tonight when I got there, there was tracks crossing the road from the north to the south and they were wet and large foot prints I don't like being ridiculed I have tears in my eyes now trying to write this to people that might understand this situation  Off to my immediate right I heard this hair raising guttural growl tall and covered with black hair! The creature soon noticed the vehicle and made its way to the cover of a nearby creek.(Coon Creek) It moved quickly but didnt seem to be paniced I ask my daughter to look and tell me what she saw, she said "" Bigfoot or something like it""  The fur looked a little longer than my hair which would make the hair about 2 to 3 inches and a little darker than color tan but a lighter color than the color brown, more of a dirty blond, it had waves in the hair, almost curly in areas A minimum of 6.5 feet tall and 250 pounds Between the time I was 14 and 18 from 1950 to 1954 we used to hear the most hair raising screams every so often.They usually come from a forest behind a 4 acre rye field that was just behind our house.First time I heard it, ma and I was cleanen up after buchering a hog.We heard the most God awfull screams coming down from Fry ridge behind our house.The hair went up on the back of my neck and we had 6 coonhounds, and there hair stood up like brillo pads and they run under the smokehouse.Dad laffed it off when we told him but later that night when he was out feedin the chickens it happened again.He come runnin in the house yellin, Did you hear that? Is that what you heard? Man ,he must have some lungs His arms hanging to his side, his hands were long enough to go past his hips I do not remember seeing any white in the eyes The heel and ball of the print appeared very human like - very similar to ""Big Foot"" prints and casts I have seen in various medias Then he took the red and drew arms and legs and head I thought about trying to follow it but since I was alone I thought better of it, but I did go back the next day in the afternoon to see if I could find any footprints but didn't find anything that I could say definately belonged to the thing I saw. A trail at that time wound back and forth in appropriately 60 foot lengths as it progressed up the hill to an old fire tower After a few minutes in the dark our eyes adjusted quite well There were “brush” marks behind several of the large (adult) footprints  I didn't even realize I still had those torches in my hands, which I finally dropped when we reached the area of the barn, which was about 100 feet from the house After we calmed him down he told us the man was real tall  I was driving North on K-7 Highway just past Leavenworth Road near Falcon Estates Subdivision when a very large animal darted across the road in front of me running on two feet  She had a lilac bush about 6 foot tall about 25 foot from her back door, one night she was looking out and saw what appeared to be two red glowing eyes peering back at her  When I visited this web site and found out that there were acutally other sightings in the state of Missouri, I thought maybe there was some worth to telling about this night Long arms .. It looked right into my eyes, I couldn't move, we stared at each other for what seemed like forever but it was probably about 30 seconds, then it turned its head and from a squatting position it jumped up an 8 foot bank and ran in the other direction All the while he was stamping his front feet, and snorting air out his nose in great puffs,as well as having his ears laid back against his head I never got any closer to him than the 100 yards and that was because it was moving very fast, swinging its arms They could have been brown, and appeared darker due to the lack of light. The creature appeared to be approximately eight feet tall and towered above my vehicle as I was about fifteen feet away from it still driving slowly down the gravel road A man might be able to run fast, but he couldn't possibly have a stride long enough to come out of a forest, cross a road, and disappear again into the forest on the other side in just a couple of seconds  Even though we never saw the creature, It was very clear that it was a large bipedal creature because of the very long strides out of the deep water  What we saw was the shape/outline of a man about 7 foot tall or taller very large frame it appeared to be hunched over as it walked so as not to hit its head on the roof overhang maybe?  It was dark outside and that is all we could see thru the sheer curtains that were hanging up  It was just pitch dark on the creek and at a slow deep section of the creek we were just quietly floating along not talking when it seemed like we startled something very large about 20ft I am not saying for sure it was a bigfoot, but after reading the article you posted about   the young bigfoot caught on a game cam that some people say was ""just a bear"" made me realize that what I saw may have been a young bigfoot I am 29 and stand 6 foot 6 inches While birding the James Reed Wildlife area in Lee's Summit Missouri in the late afternoon of March 8, 2013, I observed in the tree line on the west side of of Bodarc Lake a large brown hairy creature walking along the edge of the Lake As I looked to my left, this animal, there is no doubt a Bigfoot, came tearing down the ridge right in front of us I saw them for about 10 seconds before they disappeared, and they definitely were bipedal, similar to Human form, and they were swinging their arms over their heads each time they jumped over a large obstacle, just like Hurdlers would in race It was just before dark I was throwing dirt clods up in the air in front of bats flying around and they would chase it till it would almost hit the ground coming down the bank along the waters edge rocks were being thrown into the water about every 50 feet or so, big rock the size of bowling balls  No doubt in my mind that I saw a bigfoot From the moment I seen it, it never took its eyes off me But in all the stories I have heard, I never realized that a young bigfoot is known to run on all fours so I never made the connection until I read your website This animal was quite thin with sparse hair that was long and flowing, I got the impression it was quite old It was very tall, much taller than a normal man, muscular but thin, with sparse hair covering its body and partial face As I descended the hill, I saw a large, dark creature above the roadside It stopped next to a round bail and I realized that the figure was at least 3-4 foot taller than the bail of hay When I saw a grizzly bear run later on in life---I thought that the way its hair “flopped” up and down was the way it did on the Mo Mo that I saw.  My aunt will tell that she saw bigfoot and so will I  The distance between us and it was probably around 200 feet In May of 1986 my son-in-law and I found a freshly made footprint of something that still haunts me today At the point where the two lines of tracks changed to a single line of large (adult) footprints - presumably due to the adult having heard our vocal comments inside the bedroom, and reacted by lifting/carrying the juvenile The face had some areas that showed dark skin, with tufts of hair sticking out or surrounding the face and head It was to dark to see any features, But I could see two legs stretched out behind it, Two arms in front, A large torso, And a head First I was night fishing with my uncle when a large hairy thing came down a huge bluff making tons of noise I hit it with a spotlight across the river It wouldn't surprise either of us, at all, if it actually was a bigfoot I don't know if Bigfoot is a real animal but I know what I saw was not just someone trying to scare us. Its arms were much longer in proportion to humans Now there was 2 guys ahead of us, myself Mike and Gene, and 3 guys in back of us, at about a distance of 25 feet between each of the groups  I answered, not taking my eyes off the creature, ""I don't know, must be somebody ripping off cabins."" Implying a human form  But there are no panthers in Missouri, except in the ST Louis zoo.Ive since heard cougars out west, and they arent near as loud as this thing was, and every time we heard it the hair on my neck stood up and the coondogs would run under the smokehouse.  Then to my amazement it cleared the barbed wire fence in one stride and was gone into the night From the distance in the fog, I could tell it was white, upright, somewhat slender and VERY tall show that was about bigfoot I could see skin through the fur/hair tall or better very dark brown or black We never even spoke of bigfoot before and we were not expecting or hoping for something like that  it was a very dingy brown color very deep sunken eyes The call was almost human - but would have had to be a very large tall human It was covered with thick brown hair and it had to be big because in just 2 or 3 steps it was across the road and gone into the forest on the other side  Our fence consists of cattle panels that are 52"" tall As we traveled down E RD Mize Road towards the parking lot area, we were startled when a large creature on all fours crossed the road less than a hundred feet in front of us The cat we were with was on a tree stump near by and was looking right by where we saw it and her hair was all puffed up I contacted RON BOLES with the Bigfoot Field Research Organization (BFRO) who had been involved in investigating the traces of activities we have had on our property for many years I have chickens disappear from a locked coop and 2 peacocks killed inside a locked 10 foot by 10 foot cage There was no real bobbing of the head like I have heard of from other sightings, and the arms didn't swing out as much as others have reported, it was very human like About 9’ tall It also rained on that Sunday and washed away the footprints.We followed them into the woods. It was A very dark brown I could see his very huge hands and long fingers  It was always a few shades darker in the hollow as both sides of the road were lined with trees and foliage acting as a canopy  It's hair was a dark redish brown but the red tint could of been from the sun going down At times the juvenile tracks showed dragging toes side-by-side as if the walker was partially lifted upward so that both feet dragged marks in the snow, side-by-side, before resuming walking I would like to know what animal in Missouri could run at that speed on it's hind legs, surely a Bear cannot At that point the stride length of the larger prints grew to 6 feet in length, at some points nearing 7 feet apart This being of the woods had black eyes and a light tan colored nose that was somewhat triangular looking to me, so this giant tall very strong looking being turned and started running over towards the thrashing sound but I couldn't believe how lucky I felt We did not see the log on the path on 10/17/02 - however it was dark and we could have missed it My sighting was of short duration, about 10 seconds if that, and I don't have a lot of details, but I remember that it was tall, had to be at least 6.5 feet to 7.5 feet Each lake has a level, mowed area about 20 feet wide all the way round it By the time my sisters friend had grabbed her arm and yanked her onto the 4 wheeler, it was within it's arms reach of us but never tried reaching out to hurt us I wear a size 10 1/2 and the print is way bigger than my foot I feel watched and a few times seen something tall in the woods but could not get the nerve to get closer  I made the remark about a ""less than helpful"" co-worker to the tune of, ""he's like Bigfoot, occasionally there's a sighting"", eluding to the fact that this particular co-worker had a tendency to hide on midnights and leave all the work to the rest of us  The next morning I looked under the window and as much as 10 feet away for any sign of footprints but there was nothing there I've read a few of the other sightings here on your sight, but all that I have read are of people seeing creatures covered in dark brown or almost black long hair It was a tall black man running after it except that was not a black man chasing a deer naked, one went to my left and I could hear loud thrashing in the thick section of woods and I assumed it had caught the animal and was killing it There was no livestock in the field at that time and thats what made him notice the dark figure But, I turned and saw what I still believe was bigfoot it had to be at least 7.5 feet tall if it wasn't slumped I was starting to fall asleep, when I heard something big coming out of the woods, I was Paralyzed, I saw the giant shadow on my tent from the lantern, it was about 8 and a half feet tall with broad shoulders, I thought to myself this is not a black bear, I was about 5 feet away from where my food containers were and my cooler I said aloud “DID YOU HEAR THAT?” Sharon answered “YES I DID!” I felt the bed tremble several times very slightly… similar to when a heavy truck drives by on the road out front… and I said aloud “I HEAR FOOTSTEPS!” At that point I considered grabbing my handgun to deal with a potential intruder, but the sounds and the vibrations were not repeated  I slowly turned to my right again but this time I looked over my shoulder, right into a hairy body It swung arms back and forth as it walked like a ape, I stopped the car where it crossed and rolled down my window and turned off my engine and tryed to hear it going away but heard no sounds I took my foot off the brake and continued home  All of a sudden there was a loud screaming coming from outside it sounded like a woman/man/animal, certainly not human sounding, the noise made the hair on your arms stand up No one was there but I wanted to see this place for myself, the moon was real bright and your eyes adjusted real well to the lighting conditions and after about 20 min  I cannot be 100% sure but it could have been a Big Foot  But having just rained, the creature had left its footprints behind This incident and John Green's info makes me a firm believer in Bigfoot. I turned on the carport light, and put my face back up to the window---it was still dark for a second or two when something stepped back from the door to allow the carport light to illuminate the situation  A tree about 3-4 feet in diameter that looked to be healthy, not rotten, and relatively in good shape was laid across the track It appeared to be 7ft tall and had a long stride and arm swing I have had two accounts with bigfoots   It was in my estimate, at least as tall as I am (5'8"") covered with hair  It was only about a 40 foot walk to the door and I walked slowly as I tried to figure this out I did however notice that there was a 4 foot high barbwire fence between the field on the South and the road  As I lifted my eyes, they traveled up, up as it was very tall;  I saw nipples under a reddish  thick hair, it was not fur A few moments passed and what sounded likes a rock hit the bank on our side (maybe fifteen or twenty feet down river) followed by what sounded like another rock landing in the river (presumably in the same vicinity of the first rock) It had long reddish brown hair kind of matted or curly looking Now I dont know what I herd or saw was a big foot I could not see the face or hands because of the long hair covering its body We instantly turned and ran back to our camp where our deer rifles were.The people in the camp next to us fired one shot into the darkness, and was yelling to get their things packed as we ran to the our camp site She stood at the bedroom window and pointed to a line of large, widely spaced footprints outside… and said that it appeared that we HAD been visited by an “intruder” during the night  The arm was very large and hair covered, the hair appeared to be longer above the elbow than it was below, with the hair on the hand being the shortest. It was only about 6-6.5 ft tall, fairly thin (lanky almost. He stopped traveling at night (3 am) after something 7 foot tall white and hairy crossed a field next to the road and was gone When we arrived at the spot it was getting dark and we didn't want to stay around after dark My father is the witness, he described creature as tall, hairy {different shades of hair}, long arms, ape shaped face, with large stride, but almost limping. The next day I went down to the river on one of the river sand islands and found some big foot prints, I wish that I had a camera with me, but I did not, I kept it to myself all these years for fear of ridicule. At this point it sounded as though the footsteps were coming towards me The hair was not matted and seemed to be clean and shiny I was driving on I-35 southbound going around a curve I was driving my semi when I saw kinda forward a very tall brown mass was walking on two legs from the grassy area by the road way, it took 3 steps into the woods In the 1970s we had heard of bigfoot, but thought they were only in the Himalayas or Pacific Northwest I go fifteen feet from the trash can and it stood up.I never in my life was i prepared for what i saw,We all looked at it and i pulled in real fast and it took off in front of my head lights ten foot from us.It had long hair about 5 or six inches long and turned and looked at us twice to see if we were on his tail i guess.This was a face to face incounter with this thing It looked as if it could have made about 10 strides to me in a very short amount of time, so I stayed inside  In my opinion, the Bigfoot I observed appeared to be a unknown giant Ape that has not been identified by scientist yet.  I looked down and a little to my right, expecting to see the dog but all I saw was two huge hairy feet It was standing on two legs and was the shape of a extremely large man.I know for sure there was know way this was a bear  The bluff off the back land is a 100 foot bluff above the Meremac River  They couldn't turn around due to the narrow lane, so he put it in reverse and backed out about 100 feet to the road and made haste into town It wasn't a bear or a farm animal because they run on 4 legs  No need for me to be rambling on about a bigfoot without any other eyewitnesses in this type of environment I looked out the window through the window screen and there was what must have been a bigfoot creature of some sort  There was no evidence of footprints, but some of the leaves and grass were stirred up as if something had come through there I saw that one about 10 feet from me, so I know what they look like. The BBQ grill (covered with a winter tarp) is approximately 8 feet from the storage box, with an area between for use by summer grill masters  The hair was a buff or light color   The hair on my neck started to crawl I traveled about 200 feet south of Hwy 30 and was changing radio stations, when I looked up as I ""caught"" a glimpse of an ""upright type"" of animal, cross Carol Park Rd, from west to east  It walked across the creek and crossed the water gate which I don't remeber if it went under or over but what I do remeber is the branch had washed out the bank of my uncle's yard and his perimter fence was quite tall if you were staning in the branch and this bright red haired thing jumped over from the bed of the branch like nothing and into my uncles yard Incident #5 10/19/02 10:00 AM While walking on the upper path downstream approx 40-75 yards from our campsite, Carl and I found 2 foot prints I saw a dark brown creature run across the road in front of me I’ve watched different Bigfoot shows hear vocalizations on them and that’s the closest thing I can think of that this sounded like  I remember hearing the creature cutting the water, which was about 3 feet deep, as it walked When it walked, I could see its arms sway and its knees bend with every step  This thing was at least 7.5 or 8 ft tall and standing straight up with huge long arms and legs It was dark gray with brown hair, it was bipedal One of the line of tracks was footprints that were 13”-14” long, 5” wide at the heel, and 7” wide at the toe It looked like it had long hair It was a couple hundred feet from the carport to the tree line, and I saw exactly where it entered the trees I hadn't been sitting there more than 10 minutes, when I saw a bigfoot ascending the steep slope on the other side of the valley The creature appeared to be much taller than the vehicle, but it was either squatting slightly or hunched down a bit I looked away and down at my feet I then called security about the matter and they came out and I showed Randy the foot print when a thing crossed our path 15to20 feet ahead of us ,and with my car lights on dim, I only saw a foot up to an ankle,my daughter said she saw ,at least up to the knee,it was brown,hairy, and crossed the small bridge in about three strides,we were both so in awe, of what we saw we couldn't believe our eyes.I remember telling different one""s about it ,but you know ,(and no joke aside)mo I do not trail walk our land anymore nor do I go out at dark  And of course, I was way to scared to go back and track foot prints or anything. My father was driving to work on a county road when he noticed a large dark shape in a hayfield/pasture From the extended arm I saw long darker brown hair maybe 12 inches long blowing in the wind If this thing had stood up, It would easy have been a foot or more taller than Me.  Bigfoot had brown to light brown hair/fir coloration  Immediately upon Gregs words, the creature turned at the waist and looked at us only taking its eyes off us to look at the other bank when it exited the river This bi-pedal being stood an easy seven foot tall, was covered in light brown fur and jumped into the ditch and on a single leg, jumped the fence to keep cattle in  It had to have been over 6' tall The two lines of tracks continued in a straight line another 300 feet toward a dense treeline Reddish brown long hair, about 3’ 1/2 ‘ wide across his chest The thing that stepped back from the window was very tall---much taller than the standard height of a door---it had been so close to the door that it was blocking all the light from the carport My dog stopped right behind me and began his barking again at this very tall thing that had hair from toe to head As I was walking along the South side of the road I noticed someone walking about 300-400 feet away along the edge of the woods on the South side of pasture The night of Monday 15 Jan 2018, was dark - the night of the new (dark) moon Come on just hang in there and be ready and if they are close don't look them in the eyes, he growls unbelievable About 30-40 feet from the intersection the other direction, I observed a bigfoot On seeing us it stood erect on two legs, turned, and walked into the timber disappearing from sight. The thing (for lack of a known word to call what it was that I saw)was walking, on two legs, aimlessly, not in a hurry and I could not find a reason as to why it came into the yard as it was just looking around aimlessly and leisurely walking After watching Finding Bigfoot a few years ago and seeing how rock throwing is a common trait of sasquatch,  I emailed my friend who still lives near Kansas City, (I moved to California after College) and told him I think it was a Bigfoot encounter we had My son is 5yrs old, He knows nothing of bigfoot other than the monster truck Large footprints and actually saw a large, fur covered creature of great size/height. The hair was black and gray and fully covered the creature except for the chest/shoulder area where the creature's skin appeared to be much lighter THE LARGE FIGURE, RUNNING ON ALL FOURS, HAD A LOT OF CURLY MATTED NASTY LOOKING HAIR  It was not human, it had way too much hair for that  The footprints were huge, like twice the size of my dad's foot in width and almost twice as big in length  It stood upon two legs and looked around for a few minutes My mom said that people down the road have two big white dogs--but like I told her, this thing was walking on two legs, not on all fours like a dog There was never any talk of Bigfoot in that area, and in fact I never heard any coyotes while in the Ozarks either As we have found deer legs and parts that should not have been killed as we do not hunt our forest animals  It was around 7-8 foot tall, completly covered in red hair and 1 feature I remember is it looked like it's arms were almost as long as it's legs and that it was not afraid of us I was wllking in columbia mo.something about 9 feet tall was walking 40 feet away from me with a cone shaped head watching me he had thought it was another hunter that hunted on the farm, my dad whistled at him to let him know he was there, there was no response, so he whistled again, no response, keep in mind this is a small winter wheat field.food plot.approx 100 yards across, my dad said he stopped and studied the figure and realized it was very tall, and it was not a man, he said his hair stood up, and he made his way to a dried up slough and headed towards the house, while navigating his way he said he could hear limbs popping behind him, when he stopped to listen it would stop, when he moved again it would move, he never seen the creature again until this year 32 years later in November 2008, while deer hunting again on the same farm, he called me and told me he seen something again, on the farm, this time he only got a glimpse of it, it was on its belly crawling up a deer trail out of a slough, he said it was black in color,and very large, he said he only got a glimpse of it and believed it to be one of the creatures It was at this time that I heard something walking in the woods behind the house that sounded as though it was on two legs All I can say is how lucky i was that I wasn't on the menu that day so after analyzing this I truly believe that even though they are giant, inside they won't hurt you but will harass you to leave them alone and remember never look them in the eyes he will let out a very very deep growl and your legs will start shaking uncontrollably  THE ONLY WORDS WE COULD MUSTER WAS ""WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT""?  I URGED MY FRIEND TO STOP THE CAR TO LOOK BUT HIS FOOT HIT THE ACCELERATOR AND WE DROVE OFF About 30 feet from us in the woods, we heard the growl and scream of something big Then all the sudden he came up the creek with his tail between his legs looking back and came straight to me I shined my lights of my truck along the trees of the creeks to see if I could spot some coon and low and behold I saw what I believe was a bigfoot in my head lights at about 75 yards was a enormous blackish brown figure was walking toward the trees through the field to the creek it stopped for a brief moment and just stared at me like it was looking right at me and took large lengthy steps into the woods It stood about 7 feet, and it was hairy, the hair of the arms was hanging 3, to 4 inches, it was the only part of the silhouette that was clearly hairy and I could notice clearly that it had ape like hairy arms All of a sudden, the object stood up on two feet broadsided and froze as I continued to approach it in my car I then pulled my car around back to the road in it's direction to try and take a closer look, but only 40 feet or so down the gravel road, the fog started to get heavy  It was upright and appeared to be covered in hair  My feet became rooted in the ground as a wave of fear washed over me  It must've been around 200 feet away The arms were longer than normal and he walked in silence I saw 2 ""Creatures"" about 6 feet tall, covered in dark brown fur, about 100 feet away from us If my memory serves me right the crib was next to empty, the door was facing away from the road and it was starting to get dark, I entered the crib in a hurry not paying any attention to what may be in the crib, while looking through the cracks in the crib towards the house to see if anyone had seen me enter, I heard a heavy breathing behind me, upon turning around what I saw was indescribable for a kid my age, this huge man like creature was standing over me just staring at me he was hairy and huge it made no sounds and smelled some what like a hog pen which everyone raised in that area and time And it was not human! It was covered in long wavy hair on its body, but much less hair around the facial area It was looking down at the ground in a north west direction arms to it's side I wish I could remember its hands or feet, but I can't I will swear to this day what saw was a bigfoot. I thought my feet would never get me to the door of the house I stopped the car several feet away and it turned and looked at us and then in one big jump went from the middle of the road, over a fence and loped across the field  We looked around for more tracks we could make out beside the one, but we lost the rest in the woods because it was starting to get dark It was about 6'6"" or so, tall, stocky, broad shouldered, hairy, and naked We began to hear heavy footsteps in multiple directions, and then we started seeing either four of five of these things circling our camp  the distance from the end of the dock and the opposite bank is maybe 50 feet I have not questioned what we saw ever and still hold true to the fact that what we saw was nothing other than what is called "" big foot ""  He was all hairy and I thought goodness, that coat is over kill, until I realized it was not a coat, but a hairy creature/person   I put one foot out slowly and walked as though I had rocks tied to my feet About three years ago I was messing around on the web and came across Bigfoot website It looked like vert big person, tall, thick, and brown in color all over I do recall that the draw that the Bigfoot had come out of prior to entering the water was very dark, with thick brush and a spring fed creek in it  We were just about to get onto the dirt road and a bigfoot passed right in front of us heading into the cemetery just off the paved road  We both agreed that what we saw was not human and far too tall and massive to be a person or bear  What is amazing to me to this day is that I am the sort of person who really doesn't believe anything unless I observe it myself, but at that initial glance, I knew immediately that it was a bigfoot - not a bear, not a big person dressed up, just a bigfoot, no doubt  It was tall and stocky built As I sat watching the tree line to no avail, it began to get too dark to see my fiber optic pins on my bow  As I came around the curb, I slowed down to pass this ""person"" and thought, ""Good Lord this is a big person.""  The creature/person was so tall, That the hands and lower arm were at my passenger side car window It was over 7 feet tall, brown and had a large head though we could not see the face I was at a 5 mph rolling stop when I looked where the rabbit had run from and I saw a 7 to 8 foot tall ape like animal running on it's hind legs at my vehicle as if it were aggressively charging at me  I would say the truck stood an easy 6 foot tall It was huge, covered with black fur and long, long arms  Each said they seen two glowing red eyes, and as they drove closer they seen what appeared to be a large, about 7-8 foot tall, hairy creature standing on its hind legs staring at them  It was a winter night, about 7:00 pm and had been dark for about 2 hours  I immediately knew that it was not a man, but an animal, standing on two legs upright when I saw it Off the front of the car about 30 yards was a large figure squatted down looking at us with red eyes The feet and legs were all but blocked from view as well either from the lack of light or from the vegetation once it was in the ditch"
Montana," My Wife, myself, and my two boys observed from our car a large, big chested, very tall (8 foot), dark colored humanoid figure walk up a ridge line some 300 meters away from us About 250 yards out in the sage brush meadow was a bigfoot There is a sand bar that reaches out into the river on the west side and near the tip I saw a very tall (8 to 10 feet) hairy being and a much smaller one  And somewhere I saw a report of encounters around a ""small town in Carbon County"", a lady and her small daughter would regularly be visited by a family of bigfoots  I looked for hair on the barbed wire, or tracks The tall one had long reddish brown hair For some reason the hair on the back of my neck even stood up It must have stood at least 7 or more feet taller than myself We didn't see the big foot again  The larger creatures prints measured 17 inches and the smaller one's prints measured 14 1/2 inches around the curved foot I'm guessing it had a rough estimate of a five foot step, which were heading north, north east up the mountain  It was completely covered in jet black hair, and when the sun hit its hair it shined a brass or copper color I hope this information supports believed big foot sightings in this area I’d say the shouldners had to be 5 feet wide and it was probably 9 feet tall I watched it for a minute then I got freaked out and left We stopped to catch our breath and noticed a very large, dark unidentifiable object on the far ridge next to the power line poles Well I were a size 12 shoe and have since I was about 12 years old and I put my foot into the print and it was a good 4-6 inches longer than mine and a lot wider.Well I know what a bear print looks like as well as prints from the various animals in the area and the bear print was as close as I could come up with I came up on what we call a coulie where the road is built up between the rolling hills and has guard rails the length of the coulie, What has to be bigfoot crossed the road in front of me at the end of the guard rails, headed north, he was well over six foot tall, he didnt even turn his head to look at me, he just walked across the road  When I got towards the upper end there was a horrible stench and my hair literally started to crawl The best way I can describe it as probably the hairiest man I have ever saw well past 6 feet tall His arms swayed back and forth, hanging limply from his shoulders  Got up there and same thing, the stench made me want to gag (it seemed stronger the second time around) and my hair was standing on end Saw very large humanoid footprints (two) in the hiking trail MY PARTNER WAS DOWN BY THE CREEK AND DID NOT SEE THE BIG FOOT  I didn't see the actual foot imprints as in mud, just smashed down grass The thing was on two legs, had very long arms that seemed to end barely above the knees, its head was positioned as if a person were sticking their neck out, and it ran while barely moving its arms All we could say to each other was, "" I thought that was a bear!"" and to remark that the hair went up on the backs of our necks when the ""bear"" stood up  He only passed in front of us about 40 feet as we were heading south I'd say he was about 8 feet tall, judging from the distance, and he walked just like the saquatch in the old video of him walking through that small clearing in the forest As we backed up my cousin and I expected to see the bigfoot still in the meadow but there was no sight of him/her Incidentally there is a recent report with pictures on the BFRO website about a sighting near Red Lodge, Montana, which is relatively close to the area of my encounter It was very large and muscular with long dark hair and seemingly no neck Accross the river we watched what looked like a large gorilla like creature about 6 ft tall standing next to the river picking leaves off a bush and eating them Saw the head and both arms on the barrier It apeared to cover the distance in about 4-5 strides with very fluid motion Driver described it as ""long black hair and long arms"" I ran around the corner and about 150 feet later ran into ( almost literally) Shawn My friend came to me and asked if I beleived in bigfoot I turned with my flash light and looked behind me and almost 100 feet behind me was an up right walking creature dragging the dead elk that the car I was towing had hit down the side of a hill As I jumped out of my truck to see who or what threw the rock from up the hillside a large dark creature disappeared up the hill and into the trees IT WAS STANDING UPRIGHT AND DARK IN COLOR AND TALL,AND WALKED INTO THE TREES.IT DID NOT SEEM AFRAID.IF ANYTHING, I WOULD SAY IT SEEMED SURPRISED THAT I SAW IT Well we got about 300 yards in the woods and we came upon a footprint It looked hairy, and between 8 and 10 feet tall Sitting on a old tree stump about 5 yards into the woods was what I believe to be a bigfoot Object was very tall I did notice that it had long hair, almost like it was groomed My boot measures exactly one foot, and four and half inches wide, and my average step is about three feet  My hair was really crawling It took long, powerful strides and its arms moved powerfully as a man would walking very rapidly The closest tree line was about 50 yards away from the big foot and it had taken us only about 15 seconds to get back to were we could see the sage brush meadow again It was black in colour and looked to be at least 6 foot tall I am spooky about the military, because the people that filmed them in this location before were professionals, and the Indians I talked to said that they even got daylight footage, yet nothing was ever in the news   This thing was at least 8 feet tall  The hair on my neck stood up IT WAS ABOUT 100 FEET OR SO AWAY Should we stay up? Should we all get in the same tent? We certainly weren't going to hike back to civilization in the dark! We ended up each getting in our own tents and just staying awake all night keeping vigilant I am six foot and one inches and had to leap to reach each track Something massive and dark and clearly running on two legs ran through the brush about sixty yards away and disappeared into the forest I had the creature in the lamp beam for only a few seconds before it disappeared into the darkness   The grass there was probably 8-12"" tall and it was smashed down where the footprints were While returning to Helena after a trip to Great Falls, I saw....something....illuminated in the cars headlights on a moutainside approximately 150 feet or less off of I-15 The next day, we summited and on the descent we discovered a cave only about 15 feet deep and lined with dead pine needles The road up ahead was dark and it went into the ""thick forest"", right at the point were the irrigation canal that Monty's brother was on entered the woods About 11:00 p.m., there was no moonlight and it was so dark I could only see a few feet in front of me On my way back I was driving about 60 mph while scanning a ridge side and tree line where I had seen elk before when I noticed something very out of place and very dark running along the tree line It's hair was a rust color like to color of dead pine needles, It's eyes were haunting It was hard to determine the size but the branches the we found broke the next day were from 6 feet to about 8 feet in some places some foot print were found in places where the ground was soft and along the trail we followed towards the mountians Miles indicated that his wife came from her place of rest in the other room and stated, What was that noise? Miles replied to her, that was a recorded sound of a presumed big foot or Sasquatch It made the hair stand up on the back of my neck I looked at him in the eyes, it was surprised as I Those posts are about three to four feet of exposed post There were two of us who saw the creature walking I pointed the beam directly at the movement only 10 feet from me and got a full view of a hairy bipedal creature moving very rapidly up the bank and quartering away from me in the downstream direction He then told me to follow him because he saw a bigfoot But I have the dented roof  to prove that what I believe to be a Bigfoot threw the rock. The sound was right on top of were I had mentally placed Monty's brother to be  We both commented on how the hair on the back of our necks were sticking up and that neither of us had heard ANYTHING like that before in all our years We looked in the direction he was pointing and saw this very tall thing running on two legs beside us and then turned in front of us The larger one was standing about 5 to 6 feet behind the small one with it's arms outstreched and taking a step forward As I approached the boulder I could see some kind of movement but it was too dark to make out what it was It looked to be right at or just  taller then the knee of the larger one  I hope to possibly get another chance to witness another big foot and get one on video. I totally believe that what he and I saw was a mother Bigfoot and her young child Took a pic of a huge foot print in the mud The small one looked to be the same color with shorter hair About this time, I knew that I had miscalculated the light and it was getting dark fast  Except it was about 6 and ahalf feet tall  We saw a big foot sprint across the road on HWY 93 approximately between conner, MT  and lost trail pass/Cheif Joseph Pass Pure dark black from top to bottom The smaller one stayed out by the rabbit hutches and had curiously curled feet He walked about 15 feet then disappeared behind another tree Then a few seconds later my girlfriend said, ""do you believe in bigfoot?""  It literally sent a chill down my spine and all I could think of to say was, ""You saw that too....""  his stature was the same as the bigfoot that was filmed in the woods that was on sightings? maybe, the only difference i saw was that his hair was not extreamly long or matted, but light colored and the wind was whipping through it and it was darker at the skin than at the tips There has not been any strong winds in this area for well over a week but yet these trees are broken several feet up from the ground which as anyone well knows, is not normal I'd say it was a good ten feet tall  When I pulled up to where I saw it I looked up to see a bipedal creature or whatever it was taking large strides up the steep incline up the hill I was up snowmobileing in the elk horns and I saw a vary tall creature about 200 yards away Washburn in Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming when my mom,dad,brother,and I saw a humanoid figure,too tall to be human walking upright along a ridge around 300 yards off There I was, face to face with a bigfoot that was about 10 feet away from me In scale to the trees I'd say it was about six a half feet tall  It was very tall and black Appeared very tall We hiked about a mile and a half up into the mountains and about half way up, we crossed a little creek about 4 to 5 feet wide Eyes pointing forward In relation to our hearing the vocalization, Miles spoke to me on the telephone on day about a television program about Big Foot and someone that had a recorded soundtrack of a believed big foot scream or call It was white, standing erect, in excess of 6' tall and appeared to be just watching traffic on the highway (hard to say really, because the duration of this sighting was only a few seconds and it was dark) I find it hard to believe that someone was out there late at night in freezing weather standing in the snow in the middle of nowhere in a gorilla suit (especially a white gorilla suit!) so I've ruled that out as well. Had a very good look at a long reddish haired bigfoot standing up right on the back side of concrete barrier, long reddish brown hair It was about 5:30 PM just about enough time to get a deer and get out before dark As usual, I kept fishing until well after dark Estimated height is about 7-8 feet, guessing 400-500 pounds The foot prints of two bigfoot creatures who had visited the ranch house my son and his family were renting The thing crossed the trail in front of us about 40 feet and stopped at the edge of the brush, it just stared at us as if in the same amount of amazement as we were, and then just disappeared into the trees just as fast It was not an ape it looked more like a man but it had hair all over about 6 to 8 inches long  My Australian shepherd dog was also acting very strange; growling and his hair was standing up  Once the bigfoot shows started airing and I heard the eyewitness accounts, I realized what it was We didn't find any hair though I was suprised to see that in addition to the lone tree there was another dark form that was swaying back and forth About 45-50 feet from where I took the picture, there was a black figure that seemed to be sitting near the bank of the creek looking right as us  It strided up the hill on two legs just like any human, it leaned slightly forward as it walked Coming down a game trail on a ridge in deep dark timber I remember seeing it flow from the upper arm area, and the hair on it's head and shoulders was also long  About 25 to 30 feet there was a big root ball from a downed pine tree from the waist up crouching down was a bigfoot The area that we hunted was the foothills of the rockies on the Blackfeet Reservation in Big Sky Country"
Nebraska," I'm not sure, but I suspect I cleared our 4-foot fence without even touching it  As I rounded the curve I saw a tall human like form take 2 or 3 steps onto the edge of the road, and then spot as if to wait for traffic to clear  It was very dark in the field and I could not see anything There is no question in mind that what I saw was a bigfoot. We had been sitting for about a half an hour, when uphill in an area clear from some trees (this area is mostly covered by ponderosa pine trees), about 40 ft away we saw something on two feet run across our view out the front window, had to be running at least 30 miles an hour We looked around, but couldnt see anything considering how dark it was WAS APPROACHING AND SOMETHING OR SOMEONE CAME OUT OF THE DITCH ON MY SIDE AND WITH 1 STRIDE CAME RIGHT UP TO MY CAR AND STARED RIGHT AT ME AS WENT BY  By now the foot-falls were very near She saw a large thing covered in hair walking across her driveway We walked over to the side of the road where we originally smelled that bad smell, as we got to the edge of the road a creature that looked to be about 7-8feet tall suddenly stood up, it was very dark that night but the creature looked to be the size of a grizzly bear, but there are no bears in the area I live in It could very easily be 10 + feet as it was already ducking away when I saw it. It was around 11pm when a friend of ours jumped up from his chair screaming for everyone to look at the bean field across the highway from the house  It was covered in dark brown hair I was most impressed with the girth of the creatures legs, and torso, it was massive and about 7-8 feet in height, I would estimate the weight to be 6-700 pounds, the body was covered in medium length blackish brown hair, and the face appeared to be less hairy, I was not close enough to see any facial features, the arms swung normally and were longer than a mans proportionately I've told people I might have seen Bigfoot, but like most people, they just think I'm full of it  I could hear it getting closer, but could not see anything because of the extreme darkness I remember it being dark brown with long hair The wind was blowing fairly hard out of the north and I remember seeing the hair on it's arms and face blowing toward the front of it because the wind was at it's back  After several stops and starts, I became somewhat frightened and ran the rest of the way across the field, climbed over the 4-foot chainlink fence that surrounded our backyard, and ran up our backyard (it was basically a hill) and into the house  I estimate the height at 7 feet I had the Bigfoot sighting On the night of July 4th 1996 at about 02:00 on the actual date of the 5th THIS THING WAS AT LEAST 6 TO 7 FEET TALL AND DARK There was snow on the gound maybe about a foot worth  I was approximately 40-50 feet from it, but could not make out any facial features I don't know if it was fear or common sense but we looked at each other and decided that whatever tore up the ground around the fence was too close for us to be sitting out in the field looking around in the dark But i am now a strong believer in bigfoot, and want more than anyone to prove these amazing creatures exsist. Im wasnt sure what it was we saw or heard that night, and wasnt much of a believer in bigfoot, but then this last summer I was watching wierd travels on the sci-fi channel  From the silhouette that we saw, it was very tall, not exceptionally bulky  The arms hung almost to the knees Standing at the edge of the field next to a clothes-line pole, was a creature on two legs It ran by way to fast to notice any hair features  The foot-falls were now on my left As to my knowledge at that point, there were reports of Bigfoot in the Pacific Northwest area, not Nebraska I guess my grandpa did find some sort of large footprints He said a bigfoot like creature ran in front of him causing him to fall, the creature proceeded south towards Salt Creek about half a block The quick stride and the movement was what impressed me the most along with the sheer mass  As I crossed the field I again heard the heavy foot-falls and snapping of small branches within the stand of trees Gray hair over entire body I also remember it having long arms and it took big steps  I heard heavy foot-falls and occasional snapping of branchs within the stand of trees As I came around a gentle left curve in the road, this creature stepped up out of the ditch on my side and with one stride was upon the road bed and with two more strides was across and going down into the ditch on the other side, a car coming the other way also saw this and we both slowed to a crawl as we came to the spot, I asked if they saw something and they responded they had also seen it She said it was about seven feet tall and standing behind a tree  As I got next to the big foot i noticed that the creature was around 8 to 9 feet tall, and was covered head to toe in long black fur On both sides of the road were ditches that were about 8 to 10 feet deep We determined that the top of the stick is about 11 feet high, making the top of the swinging ‘arm’ at around 9 feet tall I'm familiar with the bigfoot lore having lived in California, but I never thought I would see one, especially in Nebraska It walked leaning slightly forward, swinging it's arms as it moved across the field  The big foot also had arms that hung lower, and longer than that of humans. In 1957 in Valentine, NE I was 6 years old and playing hide and seek...I was with another young girl and we were walking down an alley looking for the other kids when we saw a sasquatch coming down the alley toward us..it was very tall and looked like a erect ape..very hairy...and was making terrifying loud noises They were talking bout bigfoot, and they explained exactly what we saw, heard and smelled that night HE CALLED THE STATE PATROL AND THE DISPATCH SAID...THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME WE HAD A BIGFOOT REPORT  Our houses were separated by a field with a stand of trees on the north side of the field; the stand of trees was approximately 20 feet wide at that time and ran East-West  This is based on the fact that the clothes-line pole was 6 feet in height and the creature's head was a good foot above the top of the pole ALL I SAW WAS EYES ON TOP OF THIS MASSIVE BODY  It was unusually tall and covered from head to toe in black fur"
Nevada,"As he moved away Linda grabbed my arm and began dragging me down the hill I couldn't take my eyes off him and he never took his eyes off us  He had somehow managed to stand up and get his breath back and just as I touched the drapes, from a point immediately outside my window, level with and about two feet from my head, He Growled Back at the dogs He had a large broad chest, but not breasts like a female, his arms were hanging at his sides nearly to his knees and when he walked, he took long strides and his arms swung freely as he walked  He stood tall with his shoulders relaxed, but back  Those embedded in the wall of the wash were arranged in a tall half-oval with the peak about four and a half feet high we were several hundred feet from the summit of Boundary Peak  As it covered the twenty feet between the two corners, I heard three distinct, heavy footfalls -- one just as it rounded the garage, one midway between the garage and the corner of the house, and the third just under my window, where the wire trellis was set firmly into the ground  I heard the stack of two-by-fours tumble down and the sound of him hitting the six foot cedar fence as he went over it, followed by the dogs hitting the fence and then scratching at it and barking  They were about three feet from the house, stationary, barking and growling We walked both up and down the wash a hundred feet or so looking for a campsite  I have seen bigfoot and not only does it make for a great tale around the campfires at night, it fuels my imagination about every little sound I hear when I am in the wilderness  His hair was the color of dry pine needles and covered his whole body with the hair thinning just on his chest and face We reached our truck and could still see him crouching on a granite boulder at least a football field distance between us  As I turned clockwise from North to South I saw first David, about twenty-five feet away from me and a couple of feet from the rim of the wash, then what I perceived to be a giant black man about eight feet from David and about three feet away from the wash, and finally my brother, who was only about five feet behind me  He was at least eight and a half feet tall, three and a half feet to four feet broad at the shoulder, and had a comparatively narrow waist I grew up several miles Northwest of Reno, Nevada in the foothills of the Sierra's I was looking at a large greying/ brown man shape thing about ten plus feet tall He is wearing a funny hairy climbing suit."" My first thought was that he was some expert climber wearing a modern high tech climbing suit This creature was between 5' and 5'6"" tall  You could only tell where they were from a stripe of sagebrush running along their edges that was a little greener, thicker, and taller than the rest of the sagebrush in the valley  The impact and cracking sound came from a point about five and a half feet above the level of the ground outside  A great place for deer, bear or perhaps a bigfoot  I only hope that no harm comes to the Bigfoots  I believe that the great creator of all life shares the sight of the Bigfoot with people who might grow from the experience My first thought was, ""Oh my God!  They're chasing a man!""  The footfalls were clearly bipedal, the height of the impacts was too high for it to be anything four-legged, and the sound of it having its wind knocked out was manlike, if somewhat heavy  His arms hung down to the top of his knees It was at least three feet across at the shoulders These washes were eight to ten feet deep in places with vertical walls and averaged five to eight feet in width  The sagebrush also grew a little taller (about three feet) along their edges hairy dude The last 300 feet of the climb is steep with lots of obstacles, and the trail is very narrow  The giant black man was about thirty-five feet from me, standing still facing me with his arms at his sides looking directly at me (I guess he must have figured I was the lead male) It was covered with hair from head to toe  The ground was scuffed but there were no distinctive footprints  It wasn't until about a year later that I ran across a tourist pamphlet in Oregon that was about Bigfoot  The ground outside my window was about a foot and a half below the floor of my room The head area appeared to have a long hair around the face and head  The floor of the wash was granite sand so there really weren't any footprints that I could recognize to indicate where he may have been Its arms hung down to almost its knees  It was about a foot high He didn't seem to fear us although he began to walk straight up a pine needle covered slope, barefooted, without slipping  Every so often, their barking would become particularly strident, drawing my attention away from my book  His posture indicated a sense of self-worth that was almost regal and his gaze didn't flinch (as an afterthought, there was nothing about his eyes to give me the impression that he lacked human intelligence)  I briefly recognized that the ""man"" had simply stepped down the three feet I had just jumped, but didn't say anything  After several moments of consideration I decided it was possible one of the Dobermans could have had some three inch strands of hair, that the colors were within the appropriate range, and that one of the dogs might actually have managed to make it over the fence to leave it there We were walking up the foot of a mountain on the ridge of a wash and there was still about a foot and a half of snow on the ground when my cousin said that she saw a guy standing on top of the mountain and I said ""There's no one up there, it's to far from any civilizations While I was watching it, I made the listed observation: This creature would run on two legs upright until it came up on a large boulder, and then it would crawl over it on all four legs and run for a while on all four legs  Roughly 5000 feet in elevation with negligible year-round rainfall, but sometimes several feet of snow in the winter  His face seemed almost serene with very intelligent eyes - his face resembled an orangutan  Simultaneously, there was a secondary impact about seven feet above ground level across the top right corner of my window as viewed from outside It's probably just a juniper bush."" But about five minutes later, our 95 pound Doberman/Greyhound mix made a mad dash underneath the truck by the foot of the mountain After a short distance, it would stand back up on two legs and run until it came up to another obstacle  He had covered twenty feet in what was essentially two strides, and had hit the house at a point too high for all but the largest of men It's was about 4:50 pm by then  We saw no further sign of it, but was able to establish that the thing was standing next to a tree that was 11 feet tall, and it was just as tall as the tree we saw.  I had a sense of where my brother was a few feet behind me and turned to look at him It appeared to be a light brown in color with darker hair around the head and groin area  We are married ladies with kids and we take the kids up ""Bigfoot Canyon"" periodically in search of our elusive friend At that time I had never heard of Bigfoot, so it wasn't even an option for me to consider within the framework of the encounter I realized that my camera did not have a zoom on it, and that a regular 35mm would only show a dark spot at a distance of over 300 yards He had large eyes and a flattish nose I sketched a picture as soon as I got home and Linda confirmed that I had captured his likeness - I wished I had a camera on me that day On the night of the encounter, I had picked up all of the two-by-fours we hadn't used as rails yet and I had stacked them horizontally along the base of the fence back in the cul-de-sac  I thought about going outside but really didn't want to poke around out there in the dark When the two climbers reached our location I observed something moving south about 300 feet down from us in a large bowl  They were difficult to climb in and out of except at a few places where they shallowed out to a couple of feet as they intersected a draw  We were about twenty feet from the wash when we stumbled across an area with jasper and obsidian chips on the ground and started looking around in earnest for arrowheads and other stone tools  The surrounding hills rose from 50 to 250 feet above our neighborhood and were primarily granite outcroppings  Caught on the top of one of the planks was a tuft of coarse hair It spooked me and my uncle because on the way up we saw a totally decimated cow carcass! About that time we headed out to the truck because we were pretty shaken up by what we had just seen Boundary Peak is the highest mountain in Nevada at over 13.000 feet  It was dark black with hints of brownish red highlights and about three inches long I grew up in Northwestern Nevada along the California border in the foothills of the Sierra's"
New Brunswick,
New Hampshire,"We had never heard of bigfoot, I fear I am repeating myself, so didn't even know such a thing existed About 100 feet later, it happened again It was definitely taller than 7ft and stood on two legs It had orangish eyes As we started heading back I looked over a noticed a tall figure staring at me at the edge of the woods We found a footprint and a hair sample So in sum, what is all this? Am I imagining something or what? Any suggestions? Do you have any similar reports from near here (southern NK)? I know bigfoot has been cited near here several times in the past in nearby towns It was dark at the time My dog woke me with frightened barking at 4:00 AM when the sound was twice as loud and I knew the critter was within 100 feet of the house I thought, ""If this is a bigfoot, I don't want to meet him today"" At the time, I didn't even consider a bigfoot and thought it might be a moose which we have go through the yard periodically The fur was so long that I couldn't see the joint between the legs and body Surprisingly it got out of the reeds from crouched to standing turned around and ran towards the wooded area up a hill and was moving with it's arms brush and tree branches out of the way I remembered that this is what bigfoot sometimes do from the online reports  When I finally typed in the words of the actual sound it was an identical match to this site!!!  I'm not saying I had a bigfoot encounter, but I definately encountered whatever the campers up in Lincoln, NH encountered last summer!!!  There may be a rational explaination and someone may know of an indigenous animal that makes that sound -- and trust that I will still try to find out what it is.. The top branches were about 10ft high so what ever took the top pears had to be tall We immediately opened the door, but it was totally quiet and nothing more happened One of the bears here stood up against the screen door of my next door neighbor and my neighbor is 6'2"" and the bear stood as tall as he is, and I thought as I looked at this animal that it was at least that big"
New Jersey,"When I got back in my car, I noticed someone standing behind the very high brush, 7-8 feet tall at least because I could see its complete head over the bushes They were huge footprints and the toes seemed almost rectangular in the dried footprints It then got up and climbed a large rock face (about six to ten feet high) behind it  He appeared to be a light gray in color, but it could have been the lights reflecting off his hair We stood outside the truck talking when something let go a roar that made the hair on my neck stand up.Whatever it was, it was about 50 yards away and it wasn't moving It was dark brown to black  It crossed the car and ran on an angle at first towards the middle of my house, but then quickly changed course and went around the dark side of my house We seen this thing at about 25/35 feet There, at the beginning of the upper trail was a tall bulky black figure  I still heard something coming my way, it sounded like a human or something running on two feet as opposed to a animal on 4 feet galloping through the woods  As I got to my feet I looked over my shoulder to see that it too had run and was about 200 feet from where we had met It stopped mid-stride  When we were about 50 feet away, I turned to Scott and asked him to turn on the high-beams We'd hear noises and saw some of the same size footprints that the neighbor and I had seen in the woods behind my neighborhood Not from a personal experience which was yet to come, but because of watching so many people tell their stories of encounters, and just seeing the genuine fright and truthfulness in their eyes when they tell their stories  The creature was very tall, his head was taller then the top of the windows on the house so I estimate around 8-feet It was early morning,dark and very still it came within 15 feet away and stopped  I was outside of the car talking to Scott through the passenger side window, when we both heard a rustling sound near the trees on the corner of my neighbor’s property, about 30 feet away We walked through the forest in the daytime, and indeed found many peculiar structures and tree breaks I had seen before on Bigfoot TV shows The area was wet and muddy, and indeed there were footprints As we got to where it was you could see four spots where the tall grass was was pushed down from its steps.  I was just after dark and I was taking the garbage out to the dumpster i started down a trail and when i turned the corner i heard heavy heavy footsteps run away from me and smell a skunky/homeless person type oder It could not be a guy cause it had like hair all over its face! Like I didn't even see its eyes or lips or nose I was told by my mom about a year later that the cars that were always parked on the top of the mountain was a bigfoot research team  In the 14 years that I have owned this house, I have routinely heard animal calls that can't be identified as dog barks, etc., and have seen droppings and footprints in the woods that have not been from any animal such as a deer, etc., that would be seen in this area He said mom you mean that reddish brown haired creature behind those bushes?! I couldn't believe it!! I was so glad I wasn't the only one who had seen this thing because it's definitely a shock to the eyes.  I will never forget the way his eyes reflected in the headlights I then heard what sounded to be a large animal about 15 yards away but it sounded like it was moving on two legs, not four This thing was light grey and brown and it was huge! I mean huge like 8 foot tall and big like fat big I told my mom what happened and she said we shouldn't have been in the school field when it was getting dark...I was petrified and the next day my boyfriend and one of his friends went back to look for this thing, but we never found it again It's face and hands as well as the tops of it's feet were hairless and a light tan in color I AM SHARING THIS EXPERIENCE WITH YOU BECAUSE WHAT WE SAW BACK IN 1977,WAS SIMILAR TO A ""BIG FOOT"" THAN ANY OTHER ANIMAL WE HAVE EVER SEEN,OR READ ABOUT.WE'RE OLD ENOUGH NOW TO TAKE A GOOD ""RIBBING""FROM OUR FRIENDS,BUT IN 77,WE BASICALLY TOLD VERY FEW PEOPLE WHAT WE SAW THAT NIGHT No response as I continued to look I saw part of a dark figure go tree from tree  It appeared to be about as tall as the hood of my car Back then, you would attribute such things happening to the jersey devil, but in this case I would have to say after all the information today, that it was a bigfoot or a couple bigfoots who just did not want us there As we made our way to the woods about 65 feet behind the nearest apartment, my flashlight caught a pair of glowing red eyes It had crossed between us and another car, it was at least 3 foot higher than the car in front of us I didn't slam on brakes cause it was like 50 feet in front of us but I stopped pretty fast and I kid you not there was a big hairy grey and brown thing that came running right up to about 3 feet from the pavement and it stopped and turned around and ran the other way back into the woods Anyhow, I didn't remember any of this...UNTIL I was watching a ""strange creatures"" show ion late night cable about 8 years later, and heard a howl supposedly made by a bigfoot We are both avid outdoorsmen I have hunted all around the country and never heard anything like what I heard last night, except for the Bigfoot sounds on the BFRO website, it was not very long but I could still here it, it was loud and clear.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw an approximately 7 1/2 - 8 foot large figure that walked with a long steady gate,  with long arms and a thick chest I said it was definitely on 2 legs It was dark, but it looked to be a dark brown color, and the body covered in a thick shaggy looking coat  It was about seven or eight feet tall about four or five hundred pounds may be more with long dark hair and short brown hair on his neck and head  My mother said, ""What the hell is that?"" I had the same thought! Here stood this man-like creature approximately 7' tall, covered with hair from head to foot  There appeared to be a large creature on two legs behind a stand of trees  This thing was hunched down on the ground, and from the ground to the top of its head, it looked to be three and a half to four feet tall This was in the month of June I believe so it was hot and very dry, clear night, moon shine everywhere after it got dark There was a lot of trees and tall grass around the lake area All of a sudden I hear a branch being snapped or broken I looked back and there was a large brown hairy ""figure"" With long dropping arms and a smaller figure next to it My friend also heard the sound but did not look back There was a horrible smell and one of them made a really loud scream I just took my foot off the gas and didn't need to brake, then I looked left for followers and saw what appeard to be a hunter in a dark colored ghillie suit burst from the trees after the deer I couldn't make out the face for certain as it was covered in hair About fifty feet from the edge of the woods  The hair on my neck stood up and we all ran to tell our parents While talking I glanced up towards the brook when I seen two red eyes in the middle of the road about 35 to 40feet away  I must have heard something because I looked to my right and there it was, about 20 feet away Large footprints were still in the ground  It was like hair for a face It was upright but crouched over useing it's arms to propel itself across the road I entered the field to head up the hill, just then I saw a very dark figure ""crawling"" on the ground  The hair on the top of its head was somewhat long  The creture was about 5.5 to 6 feet tall I’m reporting this twenty years after the fact because we all just wrote it off as a wild animal or a bear, but after seeing the TV show “Finding Bigfoot” for the first time, and hearing BoBo cut loose with one of his calls, I made the connection that the sound I heard twenty years ago sounded almost exactly like BoBo’s call  His arms were long and lanky, and sort of swayed forward and aft as he ran I know it was real cause my man was like totally in sync with describing it to each other Every hair on my arm stood up -- I remembered everything  The creature was about 150 feet away and passed under a street light, which gave us the ability to get a decent look at it In 1978-1979 I saw the lower half of a bigfoot when driving home from work  It appeared to be about 8 feet tall, very long arms that went almost to the knees  The face itself was black but the hair was a dark sandy to light brown color It was very large and I realized that it would have to be a huge ground hog so I looked fully to the left and I saw an approximate 3 to 3.5' tall creature stand up on two legs as I passed by My brother entered a skeptic, but left a full believer in Bigfoot.  It was defiantly on two legs and covered in black hair I happened to look up and look across the school field and saw this HUGE shadow standing on a slightly raised hill across the school field, by another neighborhood...I stared at that figure for a minute thinking that person sure has long arms, It was probably 60 feet away from us at that time  Because of the lighting it was in silhouette, but we could see that it was covered with hair  As soon as I turned my head I saw this face of an animal about 6 feet high looking straight at me through this big pile of brush  It reminded me of an alligator walking due to it wasn't using its rear legs  While my friends, who do not live in this neighborhood, were initially reluctant to acknowledge that it was a bigfoot, after I explained the things that I have heard and seen around my house over the years, we all agreed that the creature was not human, and clearly fit the description of a bigfoot The ground on the right where it had gone into was loose dirt and rocky area but no foot prints were found and the creature was gone  At the same time, it lifted its left leg over the guardrail and disappeared down into the darkness of the woods I couldnt make out any details of the face feet or hands but he/it was only around 6 feet tall or so and I'd estimate the low 200lb range but was unusually fast especially for someone dressed like that It was very dark and as I was walking past Stephens State Park and then the old Saxton Falls area, I could hear something that sounded like it was on 2 feet stalking me in the woods on the ridge side of Waterloo Rd  From the living room window, we all observed a creature which appeared to be just under six feet tall walking away from my house As I watch him turning around on the ladder.I see him stop turning and he jumps from the top step he comes right down next to me.I say what the heck did you do that for.and as he says he can see these hairy legs behind this box something big runs across the attic floor and breaks down this wall to the other side of the garage and runs across the roof and out in to a cornfeld  To our horror, what we thought was a large dog stood up and began to run on two legs In March of 1978 I led a BF hunt on Mount Paradise near Crandon Lake and found footprints in the snow I was looking to see what the parking situation was there for a future hike so my eyes were on the right side of the road when out of the periphery I saw what I thought was a ground hog on the left We saw a Bigfoot about 200 ft up the pipeline Reddish-brown, orangutan colored hair, covered it's head   I came around a bend in the road and caught a glimpse of the hips and two hairy legs walking across the road I would estimate it to be over 7ft tall, brown and very shaggy Since I seen this I started watching that finding Bigfoot show but their videos and pics are always something black I AM NOT ONE TO WRITE IN,AND EVEN AFTER WE TOLD MY HUSBANDS UNCLE WHAT WE SAW THE FOLLOWING DAY,HE LAUGHED AND SAID IT WAS PROBABLY A BROWN BEAR.WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT BEAR,BUT I HAVE NEVER SEEN A BEAR WITH ARMS THIS LONG SWINGING THEM SIDE TO SIDE It was over 6 feet tall but it wasn't over 7 feet Whatever I saw that day was an easy 12” taller and three times bigger around than my son THIS HAPPENED SO QUICKLY,BUT MY HUSBAND AND I STOPPED THE CAR ALITTLE FURTHER UP TO ASK EACH OTHER WHAT WE JUST SAW.JUST FOR YOUR INFO,I AM A BELIEVER,AND MY HUSBAND IS THE SKEPTIC IN THE FAMILY.HE SAID EXACTLY WHAT I HAD BEEN DESCRIBING TO MYSELF: ABOUT 6 FEET TALL.HAIRY BROWN,WITH UNUSUALLY LONG ARMS THAT SEEM TO SWAY MORE LIKE AN APE.WHEN IT STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF OUR CAR,IT'S FACE LOOKED MORE APE/MONKEY LIKE THAN HUMAN HOWEVER FEATURES WERE THERE THAT MADE IT APPEAR HUMAN LIKE.IT RAN/WALKED QUICKER ONCE IT SAW US Its arms were long and swung in large motions as it walked My brother however, always laughed at the subject of Bigfoot, and was a complete skeptic I never believed that a bigfoot or anything like that was in this area I was unable to tell where it went from there, it had gotten very dark and I stayed put until my dad came looking for me with the tractor i saw nothing but thought this might be a bigfoot Nothing like I have ever heard I was able to see the face of both , their eyes were yellowish And they had very large foreheads and their hair was about 5 inches and very dirty knotty The tall one grunted as it left and the smaller one let out a scream Then they took a really long step and were gone I never went back to that area again I tried to tell my friends dad who was with us and he didn't believe me But I know what I saw and heard .. As I was driving along I caught movement out of the corner of my eye and saw a young deer (judging by size) bolt out of the trees across the road from left to right about 100-200 feet in front of my car As night fell, we made a fire, and watched the numerous stars reveal themselves as the night got darker I was kind of thinking to myself that my eyes were playing tricks on me but I just couldn't shake it I began to hear bipedal walking in the swamp below us, what sounded like sticks breaking and snapping When i was 14 i was camping in Wharton state forest north of Hampton furnace.I was alone.Just before dark I was out walking,I became aware that something was shadowing me back in the brush.It followed me to camp and began to circle.It was very stealthy, it circled while I cooked and got ready for the night.I finally crawled in the tent and tried to sleep.After awhile I heard a faint sound behind me, I was about to look out the back window when this thing started screaming,I have never heard anything that loud in the woods The volume was like a car horn up close.people tell me it was an owl,well I have heard alot of owls and they can't even come close I am driving and in a split second I saw something brown on 2 legs and about 6 feet tall sprint behind the car in the area we were just in I went down the next day and seen where the drag marks were from it dragging its feet and where it seemed to get up and walk into the woods The fact we were two women alone on this dark road, was not a good idea  I could see hair that was brown and about 4-7 inches in length  She said that she just saw something tall and light brown walk across the road we were on It did not appear to be exceptionally tall (not eight feet tall anyway) but the sheer girth of the thing was impressive Wen I locked eyes with it I could not see whites just big dark brown eyes As soon as I heard it, it felt like my heart literally dropped and my legs became wobbly, but I summed up my courage and once again ran back to the campsite in fear NJ:2AM/;Summer morning:1977:Owassa Rd:Sussex Cty While traveling back from the Dover Station and returning to Camp Kiamesha a group of counselors encountered a large creature as it crossed the road in about 3 steps, it stood about 7 feet tall and as it crossed the road, it turned and our headlights caught its shape and eyes The fur it was covered with was a golden brown a little darker than a golden retriever, very much like the color of a groundhog It was roughly 5 foot in height hunched over After it got dark and we were roasting marshmallows, we heard the same sound, now closer to us, to the left  It's head was hairy also, except for the areas surrounding the eyes, cheeks and mouth What I thought were reflectors were eyes and it took off into the woods My memory fails to remember exactly how tall off the ground it was but the encounter lasted several seconds, from when I first heard the walking, saw the dark flash and when it subsequently disappeared or stopped in the swamp It ran towards us silently, but with huge strides, as it came closer and closer Something rain across the road on two legs It covered about 30 feet in three strides and disappeared The screams faded totally within 10 minutes  We were walking throught a area that is primarily brushy woods, but alot of wet land with only clumps of  tall grass  I landed arms first and slid across a gravel covered road We saw that it was hairy with three to four inch length reddish/brown hair and while standing it was about five feet tall  The total time we had eyes on the creature was between 3-5 seconds  I bolted toward my apartment, running so fast that I lost my footing as I was going through a dip in the terrain By now it was dark as i climbed down from my stand  Expecting to see the creature in the headlights, there was nothing but dark road…..he was gone This is the first instance in which I have seen a creature that I believe is a bigfoot And it was big! it ran the distance of the building in 5 or 6 foot hops then through the wall It was getting dark so I started walking towards home Also, some strange footprints as well in the muddy areas It was just getting dark and was on Skyline Drive in Ringwood, NJ i then heard footsteps coming tawards me in the thick vegitation No glowing eyes like a deer, fox or coon Incidentally, this experience ended up in me producing a novel, ""Dark Woods,"" years later I remember it was hairy like an animal and appeared long in length"
New Mexico,"A few swings of it's arms, and it was out of there my sister in-law ran in to my mother in-law's house from outside and said that she seen something very tall walking on the trail below the house I got up to see if there were any footprints  I did not believe in Bigfoot, ghosts or another unexplained anomalies The next day, my co-worker and I went back to the site and found the footprints, he had a digital camera and he took some photos of the footprints I kept my eyes on the figure while making the turn right The hand and foot area were just rounded off, like nubbed Along the pond, we saw hoof prints from cows, dog prints, deer prints, no noticeably Bigfoot prints  I needed to pee rather urgently, so I ran around to the back of the station to find a dark place to do my business i looked at him and turned on my side work lights and he put up his hands to block the light from his eyes and thats when i got a real good look at him .  Also, I think that the big foot is much more intelligent than the leopard  They played some recordings of what were believed to be big foot  It took strides that I would estimate to be 3-4 of my strides per 1 of it's strides I said to my wife,  ""Did you see that?!"" She said, ""What?"" I said, ""Something is standing over there by the road."" As I looked, I noticed that the figure was standing by a small pond, which was about 10-15 feet from the road  The one attribute of the creature that resounded with me was how heavy the footfall was 2) The hair on the creature was matted, like dogs that live outside We could see the legs (two) turn, the arms (two) turn, and it started running away from us up a small hill into the trees There is one other trait that I have since read about that may allude to this being a New Mexico Bigfoot I would say when I first saw it, it was about 75 feet away It was probably between 10:00p.m.and 11:p.m when they were driving down  road 285 headed north a big,tall, black human looking thing was standing in the road upon the car coming up closer the black thing which stood over six feet tall, very husky, walked very fast like a gorilla walk across the road  I think big foot is a timid, shy creature that is very good at concealing itself, and there is probably very small numbers of them I COULD SEE A DARK FIGURE STANDING AT THE WINDOW Before we left I took a look around and found 4 trees bent from about 4 feet from the ground. I thought ""What the heck is that!"" It looked like a man but, as I was watching it I noticed it had hair covering its whole body with a mixture of grey/ dark brown and white on its chest tall and big, it was walking on two legs and went into a small gully i pulled the vehicle around and shine the light up the gully and i could not relocate the animal  I suppose my father thought someone was stalking our camp on foot (if a vehicle pulled up, we would have heard it and seen head lights long before it got to camp) It was about 7 or 8 feet tall, it was black, it's head kind of had a point near the back, as it walked it seemed slightly hunched over and it naturally swung it's arms We were about 30 feet away from it when it ran up the hill I waited for 10 minutes more but didn't hear anymore footsteps and I turned on my cell phone again to check my time which listed it as 0215 due to the darkness and only seeing it through the head lights i could not make out the hair color it appeared dark I couldn't say anything but tell her, it was a Bigfoot It was still squatting by the corner when I heard a second set of footsteps to the southeast of the tent about ten feet away It took large steps and its arms swung back and forth  I sat up in my sleeping bag just in time to see a massive light-brown hairy arm reach into the tent through the front flap and start to ""feel around."" Totally horrified, I started to hyperventilate, as this huge arm clearly was not human he was about 3 to 6 feet away and it was dark and had just rained  As it was turning and running, we didn't see any clothing, buttons shining from the headlights/moonlight, we saw a huge mass, a body running on two legs, we never saw any eyes  I seen the creature a few feet thru my trucks passenger front window It was getting dark by the time we got there We sat there waiting for them for over an hour, it was well past dark when I heard them coming up the road to camp Earlier (about an hour) there were dogs barking to the west on the other side of the lake, so I thought it was a dog at first, but it was walking on 2 legs  We were back a bit early (we usually stayed out till dark) because we had not seen a thing all day or the day before  He was probably 7 feet tall because when he got real close to the vehicle I couldn't see his face  We did not expect my father, neighbor, or his son back until after dark It was as tall as the cedar trees that are around there  I believe it is completely possible that big foot exists, and I think as our forests get smaller due to development, highways, homes, etc, we will eventually find one dead or alive The head and the feet also the hands were all dark in color and the legs were dark grey We noticed the legs and arms, and for sure it ran on two legs up the hill It then started to walk faster, picked up it's stride a little more The distance between the tracks was on the order of four feet or more, an interval that was all the more impressive considering the extreme steepness of the mountain in that area The bigfoot was very tall, hairy, skinny, with long arms. The sound of the footsteps was muffled and was bi-pedal  Blackish-Brown hair that could be seen hanging from all over its body  As best we could tell it was coming from the tree line approximately 300 yards to the east across an arroyo at the foothills of the mountains my name is ( withheld ) i am a water hauler i was working on some water pits early one morning in december around 3:30 am it was very cold that morning  i had my work lights on  around my truck i smelled what i thought was a dead animal when i noticed in the moonlight something very large on two legs running around my truck it wouldn't get near the light it seem to be afraid i didnt say anything to anybody one day i told one of my coworkers and he told me he had seen something a month earlier that looked like a animal on two legs and was chasing his truck the reason im telling you i read that the sighting was in january of this year in raton i was curious if its maybe the same thing this happened in ( withheld ) between bloomfield nm and dulce nm ( withheld ) my coworker and talked about what ever it was  in feburary he called me one evening about 7:00 pm and told me he had seen it again and it was standing next to his door on the drivers side ive never heard of anybody being that afraid on the phone  but to this day we havent heard of it being seen  lately That is probably why we didn't see any eyes  I thought it was a very tall person at first but when I looked I noticed that it wasn't human On her way back down she just happened to look out of the window and she saw this dark figure walking up the road  The creature stood up, and quickly lumbered into the dark away from the direction of the parking lot The students immediately starting exclaiming, “Bigfoot, bigfoot!” Doing my best to downplay the tracks, I told the students that they were probably those of a hiker and that they had become enlarged as a result of melting and refreezing About 2 years before that, a bigfoot followed my brother in-law home from a friends house about 12:00am He saw it down the road, about 150 yards away I saw it walking into the dark carrying something in its hand As my headlights flashed the ""Bigfoot"" it turned I have lots of stories from my grandma about Bigfoot No details, such as toe impressions, remained or could be readily detected, but every indication was that the tracks had been made by bare feet, not boots The vegetation consists of Sage brush (4 to 5 feet tall) on the flats, juniper trees on the hills and knolls, to Ponderosas on the top of the cliff and mountain tops  Broad and at least 7 ft tall I figured it was a bigfoot because we've heard it around here. Then I checked where I heard the second moving and found what looked like a footprint The camper/truck was in a spot where the nearest trees were 60 to 80 feet away on the North, West, and South sides of camp, The East side of camp faced the flats and the road Somewhere in this stretch, crossing the trail at a right angle, was a series of very large, apparently bipedal, tracks  Whoever banged on the camper would have had to clear 60 feet of open ground very quickly to get to the nearest tree line It stood at least 7-8 feet tall It was wider and taller than a person My wife and I aren't crazy nor are we believers of Bigfoot until now I cannot tell anyone that it was big foot because we did not see anything By the way, the pond was only about 10-15 feet wide, it was just runoff of rain water, so it isn't always there during the year he was about 7 or 8 foot tall and very musculer build hie hands where like a humon hand but bigger and his face was that of a gurillas but little more human and his hair was long and dark brown after a few seconds he let out a scream and turned around and ran off with very long strides and very smoth gat . I fell asleep eventually but then awoke to the sound of two loud, heavy footsteps directly outside the tent The creature had a shiny brown hairy coat, it was approximately 7 feet tall, it's face was like a monkey's and the eyes were big and black, like a big teardrop shape The outside of the tent you couldn’t see without a light source, the best you could see was about 2 feet in front of you and the rest was pitch black The footprints were about 4 to 5 ft apart, we tracked it to the East into the brush area  Through the dim outside light (and through the tent material), I could make out at least two figures possibly eight feet in height So, I pulled the vehicle, left towards the ""Bigfoot"" to flash my headlights on it The torso was skinny, narrow shoulders, the arms and legs were about 3to 4 inches in diameter, it had elbows and knees but I did not see any hands, fingers or a type of foot or toe structure He didn't know it had followed him, but when he looked behind him he saw that the bigfoot was standing there looking at him, about 10 feet away I saw this tall hairy thing like a man standing next to the other window looking inside my home  We did not hear rustling or footsteps  The coloration was dark brown  Here are the salient points from my memory (aside form the footfall): 1) The creature was approximately 8-10 feet tall My wife and I both saw the bigfoot running across the hwy  It was running on two legs up the hill I would put it at about 7 feet tall, skinny, gray in color, arms past the knees, like looking at the back of a grinch head-pointy Big foot sighting Saturday June 15, 2002 At approximately 8:30 pm I was on my way back from a dinner with my grandfather Near Shiprock, NM"
New York,"They responded with two of their own tapes which contained even more supposed bigfoot vocalizations I’m not a afraid of too much, but for some reason the hairs stood up on the back of my neck and I got into what I call (combat mode) I just wanted to share our story as i have never in all my years been a believer in a creature like this but will tell you my mind has remained totally open since then The sun was starting to set behind the mountain and it was going to start to get dark quickly  Her impression was that it was large, dark, upright and didn't move like an animal Immediately after firing, something about 10 feet into the brush began screaming/howling sounding exactly like your recordings only with bass or ""power"" and shaking the small trees and brush violently The creature was huge, at least 7.5 feet tall It seemed to float through the grass as I could not see its legs due to the height of the grass it moved through Suddenly I heard foot steps coming from the woods heading toward us As if all this wasn't strange enough, we then heard the snapping twigs about fifty feet behind it As I have stated I never saw anything out of the ordinary and was certainly not aware of ""Bigfoot"" or anything like it being seen in New York State It was covered head to toe in shaggy dark brown hair or fur It much darker in the creek bottom and everything was in shades of gray A year or so later i told something of the story to another friend and huning partner of mine , he was playing with me and said ""hey maybe it was bigfoot"" , up until then i never thought about that at all, then one day the same friend played me some supposed recording of bigfoot that he found on the internet and my jaw dropped , a sound i hadent heard since that day a little over a year earlier was playing in front of me , belive me when i tell you the chills were enough to kil ya No neck, the hair from the head went down to the shoulders It was completely blackened from head to toe and approximately six to seven feet tall I was still sitting at the base of the tree having not moved location for a half hour when I noticed something walking on two legs approximately 75 yards away  It swung it's arms in an ape-like fashion at its sides as if to gain momentum I know it was an animal because its eyes reflected in the spotlight  I saw the upper 2/3 of its body which appeared to be dark brown or black in color It looked up there and saw what seemed to be a very tall hairy figure, not running, but not walking, to the top of the hill At first sight I thought it was a girl with very long hair but quickly noticed that it was completely the same color with no obvious clothes coloration and moved much too fast although at the distance I was I could not make out any actual features and at no time did it look in my direction, but I believe I startled this creature by pulling into the stone driveway which makes considerable noise All of a sudden we both hear what we thought was an animal or something running through the woods, when (what we believe was a 'bigfoot') ran across the path we were walking on I can't say this is a ""Bigfoot"" encounter, however, two events occurred that is very similar to what others have experienced in Bigfoot sightings She was definitely what I would call breasted and large roundish belly and large torso and had to be all of 8 feet if not bigger. It was black, and it looked as if the hair was short  Unfortunately we can't provide any accurate dimensions or descriptions of physical details but even though we're not sure of what is was, we're sure of what it was not! We then continued on to Fox Island which is about 200 yards from the sighted critter and only about 50 feet from the mainland and chatted for a bit It had heavy fur like hair all over it It appeared to be around 6-7 feet tall When I say traveled very quickly, I mean it was really moving very rapidly but at no time did it seem like it was running as you or I would look if traveling at that speed due to fact that there was no discernable movement of its arms as it ""floated"" through the tall grass The height of the bottom of the window frame was approximately 6 feet above the ground  In all honesty, I thought I had either seen or bear or my eyes were playing tricks on me A ditch (approximately 3 feet wide and 2 feet deep)runs along side of the road We set up camp in a field next to the lake a few hundred feet off the applician trail Deer would constantly wander through and many times I could be 10 feet from a deer and be silent so as not to spook them  There was probably a foot of snow on the ground Then about 15 minutes later (I have not moved from the base of the tree sitting on the ground same spot) to my left approximately 30 yards an object hit a tree about 25 feet up in the tree I could'nt make out a face because it had long tangled hair hanging down It wasnt brown like we would have picture bigfoot being, it was more like grayish-white I'm about 6'5"", and It looked like it was taller than me from what I saw WE DID NOT DISCUSS IT FURTHER THAT NIGHT.THE FOLLOWING DAY WE ASKED EACHOTHER WHAT THE OTHER PERSON SAW AND WE BOTH AGREED VERY CLOSELY ON THE DESCRIPTION ONLY MY FRIEND SAW A LITTLE MORE DETAIL.AFTER SOME TIME WE MADE UP THE NAME THE"" GREEN MONKEY""DUE TO THE GREENISH HINT THE MOON MADE ON ITS HEAD.I HAVE ONLY TOLD THIS TALE TO FAMILY AND CLOSE FRIENDS DUE TO FEAR OF BEING RIDICULED.MY FRIEND HAS REALLY NEVER WANTED TO DISCUSS WHAT WE SAW ESPECIALLY LATER IN LIFE.IN 1990 MY FATHER PASSED AWAY AND IN 1994 I MOVED INTO THE SAME HOUSE/COMMUNITY AND TO THIS DAY MY FRIEND REFUSES TO DICUSS THE INCIDENT AND AT NIGHT ON MY PROPERTY I STILL CATCH MYSELF BEING SCARED WHEN IM OUTSIDE AT NIGHT ESPECIALLY IF ITS DARK.THIS IS A (TRUE)STORY AND THE IMAGE I SAW IS ETCHED IN MY MEMORY,I WISH I WAS A ARTIST SO I COULD PUT IT ON PAPER. What is the real story on bigfoot I had already known that this area has had its own encounters with bigfoot so I suspected that this was what it was  When they came out the second time one of them threw it's arms in the air while squatting and then they ran back into the woods I made a report a few years ago when we were hiking up Buck mountain when a bigfoot was smashing trees and making that loud click noise like I can do with my tounge but 10 times louder Its face was hairy yet fleshy around the upper cheeks The upper body was massive and stocky like a football players build It was I believe 6-7 feet tall, a slimmer build I couldn’t tell what color it was but it was big we went back the next day and my buddy who is 6’2 tried to cross the guard rails and he had trouble doing it so I would have to say it was at least 7 feet tall There were some loud bumps and bangs as if something was throwing bricks around the storage room (our storage room was approximately 16 feet by 32 feet and attached to the back side or lake side of the house) What I saw when I looked out the window was no further than four feet from the back of my house and striding by the window when I looked It looks to me to be about 5 to 5-1/2 feet in height, dark in color, very strong upper body and fast as hell in the trees. It was on two legs, all brown-red hair all over it and at least six feet tall We didn't realize we were looking at hair and not a sweat shirt  Before October I could have cared less if bigfoot existed, now I'm a bit curious It had been crouching there on its feet like a catcher from a baseball team While driving we both saw what looked like a large man move from the shadow of a large tree and cross the road in 2-3 strides I don't know what did all of this and maybe it is easily explained away but these things altogether make me think it might have been a bigfoot.  The owls seemed to have been about 50 feet apart  Unlike the way a human pumps their arms and fists for speed when running Wasn’t alarmed by this, although it was dark and there was no flashlight the neighbors do walk through there from time to time Bigfoot Sighting Date: Early August 2010 Time: Approx That would make this thing about 8-10ft tall roughly Now my husband had a habit of walking very fast sometimes out of my sight and I kept yelling, almost crying,"" Wait ,wait for me!""As it got near dusk, the road was darker and darker and I finally grabbed and held on to his arm so I wouldn't be left alone and behind it was about 7 - 8 feet tall tan in color or gray fur Its eyes were dark in color but clearly visible and had a brightness about them Its belly was about the top of an almost 6 foot tall fridge This thing was huge - at least 7 feet tall I walked down to my tent.The tent was set up right on the lake shore, I mean one maybe two feet away from the water it looked like a broken off tree trunk darkened by shadow.. Damn it looks like one BIG woman(torso completely visible and appeared large chested with what I'd figure as breasts) Ya and why she all dressed in dark with a hooded sweatshirt on(looking back on it now I'd give a smoked charcol dark grey) Damn they better step back if they don't wanna get hit(we actually slowed a bit due to oncoming car and passing at location of creature so we needed the full road and edge of shoulder to pass the car) The creature seemed to be looking more at the other vehicle and didn't turn to look at us till we were just about to hit/pass The thing was about 7 feet tall He then realized it was a black haired creature, approximately 6 foot tall, 2.5-3 foot wide shoulders That's when we realized what the splashing was.Then we noticed a man like figure with red beady eyes when we flashed the light at the bushes about 2 feet above the bushes was the eyes The creature was clearly observing us, as it paced back and forth, looking around trees, standing up taller, ducking down, etc To begin with, I had never heard of your organization nor knew that Whitehall was a supposed hot spot for Big Foot sightings He noticed to his left something in the woods and turned to see a tall, white, hair covered creature standing just off the path in the woods We were outside playing, in front of her house and out of the corner of my eye, I saw a huge shadow and I remember saying ""What the hell is that?"" to my friend and before she could respond we both saw the ""BIGFOOT"" running (on two feet) on the side of the road from approx We drove the car slowly up to the place we last saw it but my friend (who was driving) didn't take her foot off the gas and didn't stop There are NO street lights in that section and a very dark section it is  There were only two discernable markings in the sand which were obscured from the pivoting of its feet when it turned around She was obviously big and even though she was standing on the bank, i'd have to say that we saw about 5 feet of the creature from about waist to high upper upper on up and looking back on it now and knowing the bank that she probably had about 4 feet we couldn't see below the bank edge That's when I saw a light brown leg turn into the tree line and a tall, upright ""man"" walk into the tree line Being cold as it was, I remember it breathing through the hair in front of its face (that really creeped me out) It actually raised the hairs on the back of my neck, it was definitely a strange odor Both times, I can say that the tallness of the figures, using the tree heights as a baseline, were definitely well above 6ft. 2)  Fall 2003: One night around 7:30 pm (dark) my wife and I  went outside with 2 dogs Two-foot stride The ground rose between myself and this entity and went back down on its side so I could not see the lower legs good  It ran extremely fast on two legs leaning slightly forward with what we estimated today to be a stride of five to six feet as the road was approximately 30 feet wide  THIS THING WAS WALKING ON TWO FEET!! I checked the area the next day and found a large foot print in soft earth.. I WAS CROSSING THE RAILROAD TRACKS HEADING SOUTH, AND WHEN I LOOKED TO THE WEST OF THE TRACKS WHILE CROSSING, THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE A BIGFOOT CROSSING THE TRACKS HEADING NORTH Also, considering the size of the shadow and the height of my window above the ground the figure had to stand at least 7 to 8 feet tall to cast such a shadow Once reaching the bottom and crossing over the creek we were both stopped dead in our tracks by a sound which made both of our hairs stand on end I got a fearful sense of where this thing went and had a feeling it may try to flank me around the 2 homes, so I went into the house and awakened my wife and said “there’s something weird out there."" I did not think of ""Bigfoot"" right away, because it was not the Patty type I seen on the P&G film  As I was driving, I saw something dark stand up from inside the ditch and head into the woods At first I thought it was a large man in a fur coat because I could see its arms, legs, head, and torso; but this creature was much too big to be a man and the fur seemed to be covering its entire body  It was moving very quickly and was walking on two ""feet"" I stop there to look for deer in a large field behind the quarry that are always there and immediately noticed when I exited my truck a dark biped moving very rapidly through waist high field grass on very uneven rocky terrain I figure it was at least between 7 to 9 foot tall The neighbors house was about 8 to 10 feet away with no french between the properties The next day he contacted a local Whitehall Bigfoot researcher Paul Bartholomew whom visited the site with the witness and took plaster casts of the two footprints on the side of the road. When we got up to the spot where ""it"" crossed into the area of the tall grass near the tree line, I remember looking for the ""man"" in the area The shape was about 3 1/2 feet off of the ground at its highest point It made a whole bunch of noise when it walked behind our camp (more than any animal I have ever heard) and it's footsteps almost shook the ground  I just went to this website today and listened to some of the sound clips available of 'BigFoot' Her arms wer almost to the level of the road There were two trees about 20 to 25 feet in height bent completely over and parallel to the ground across the logging road I at first I thought the tracks could have been made by deer leaping, but the tracks appeared to be a two legged stride with one foot pointing a little right and one a little left alternating perfectly We thought at first that it must be a very tall human but when it went under the streetlight, we saw fur from head to toe and it was approx I was startled and pulled down my phone to see this with my own eyes I KNEW it was a bigfoot and told my sister not to worry because she hates the woods and couldnt sleep As I approached the breakwall, I noticed a dark brown object on the opposite side of the lake at the shore As I was focusing in, the animal stood up on two legs I don't know what it was, but I've heard of Bigfoot sightings down near Clarendon, where I used to play paintball a few years ago as well as on the Indian reservation towards Buffalo I am 6 feet tall, and I took my snowshoes off to see what king of stride I could make, and I was about a foot or two short of reaching the stride of these prints They were quite long, but the snow could have melted to make them bigger? What struck us was the length of the stride though  By then, the NYDEC had installed docks in that bay so we could tie up to and go ashore Now the location of this thing in relation to the road and time of occurance was quite quite a dangerous spot for a ""person"" and most people would have probably stepped back away from the road but keeping in mind one step back is about 6 feet down easy There was this large dark figure just standing there turned my way Once we reached the northern end, the pond's edge was only about 10 feet from the hedgerow mentioned previously, and since we were pre-occupied with our ""hunt"" we had our backs turned to the hedgerow It was a striking shade against the ligth green of the brush.) Moose are never that shade - they are always a very dark brown I had never even heard of bigfoot when I was 14  The arms only swung slightly IT WAS TALL, HAD DARK HAIR (LOOKED KIND OF LONG OR SHAGGY)...ONE ARM SWAYING BACK AND FORTH AS IT WALKED I first thought maybe another human was there hunting, but then it was apparent to me it was dark reddish brown from head to feet She wasn't maybe five feet from the side of the truck and I looked her in the face out the side window as passing Long arms, ended near the knee As he approached, he saw it step over a side railing about 3 feet high with little effort and descend into the woods towards a high power line  Then a second, much smaller creature that I realized was a bigfoot, come out of the brush The area of the town of Bath, NY is semi-rugged with hundreds of huge foothills  The screams made the hair on our necks stand up Not hurried stride It was a very dark night but I saw no flashlight shine Dark brown color It was very dark this night and cool More like a fine-tuned athlete than a body builder, long arms and an awfully long shaggy head of hair (which stood out too me, WEIRD Saw dark hairy hands Features of the upright being I saw were large thick long hair covered legs, human like strides, and tall enough that the headlights did not focus above its midsection, so I couldn't make out facial features I say possible creatures because even though I have a strong feeling they exist, I have not seen one with my own eyes At the time, I was an 11-year-old boy and had never heard of Bigfoot It was about seven feet tall and was very dark brown in color Observations: I could not ascertain its height exactly, because of the distance, but I would guess that it was approximately 7-8 foot tall 20 MINS AND CARRYING ON (NO BEERS YET)WHEN MY FRIEND GRABBED MY ARM AND POINTED TO A FIGURE HUNCHING AND HOLDING ON TO A SMALL TREE WITH ITS LEFT ARM (APPROX 30 FT AWAY AND UP THE TRAIL FROM US,THE TRAIL WAS ABOUT 10 T0 15 FT WIDE AND LET ALOT OF MOONLIGHT FILTER THROUGH.)I WAS IMMEDIATELY ALARMED BECAUSE SOMETHING ABOUT THE FIGURE SEEMED OFF TO ME,EVEN AS A BOY OF 15 TO ME ITS STANCE WAS VERY MUCH LIKE A PRIMATE HUNCHING.WE BOTH SAID WHAT THE HELL IS THAT AND THINKING IT HAS TO BE HUMAN BEGAN YELLING EVERY COMMUNITY WEIRDOS NAME WE COULD THINK OFF AT IT.THE THING WAS RIVITED NO MOVEMENT AT ALL IT REALY APPEARED TO BE STUDYING US.AFTER A VERY SHORT TIME WE BOTH ADVANCED TOWARD IT AND TRIED TO GET A BETTER LOOK AT IT.I WILL NEVER FORGET WHAT I SAW A MEDIUM SIZE MONKEY/APELIKE CREATURE ITS PROPORSIONS WERE APE LIKE TO ME A LONG TORSO,LONG ARMS,SHORTER LEGS AND A LARGE LONG HEAD THAT SEEMED OUT OF PLACE FOR THE BODY SIZE,(SORRY I DIDNT SEE THE FEET)OF WHAT I SAW WAS COMPLETELY COVERED WITH FAIRLY LONG HAIR I COULD NOT SEE FACIAL FEATURES BUT DUE TO THE MOON LIGHT ITS HEAD(HAIR) WAS A LIGHTER COLOR,DONT LAUGH BUT ALMOST A LIGHT GREENISH COLOR.ITS STANCE WAS LIKE ALMOST SQUATING WITH ITS RIGHT ARM HANGING SLIGHTLY AWAY FROM ITS BODY WITH ELBOW OUT AND TOP SIDE OF FOREARM FACING US ,ITS LEFT HAND WAS GRASPING A BRANCH AT ITS HEAD LEVEL WITH LEGS BENT AND KNESS FACING US.I CANT EMPHISE ENOUGH HOW THE LEGS APPEARED TOO SHORT FOR THE TORSO AND THE ARMS SEEMED TOO LONG FOR THE TORSO AND THE HEAD SEEMED TOO TALL/LARGE FOR THE BODY,IT WAS VERY VERY VERY DISTURBING.REMIND YOU THAT DURING ALL THIS WE ARE SCREAMING TO EACHOTHER WHAT THE HELL IS IT.MY FRIEND ADVANCED EVEN FURTHER TOWARD IT,I WAS FROZEN WITH FEAR AT THIS POINT MY FRIEND YELLED RUN RUN RUN.WE BOTH BOLTED BACK DOWN THE INCLINE AND ALL THE WAY HOME WE WERE NEXT DOOR NEIGHBORS AND THE ONLY THING WE SAID WHILE SPRINTING HOME OVER AND OVER WAS"" WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT ,I DONT KNOW"" I've seen drawings and such of Bigfoot, and this creature looked similar, but had white around his hairline, and his fur was dark brown, almost black When heading south, right along that section there is a very steap bank at road edge to your right side with no guardrail and bank at it's highest might be 15 feet and drops down to a slightly tree'd slightly open flat so to speak This is not my first time I had the feeling bigfoot was around Observed a tall & black sasquatch standing on left side of road next to a large white pine tree, possibly 300' ahead of my car It looked like it was slouching, and I couldn't really see it's arms My observations of the creature are as follows: It was approximately 7' tall, covered in hair, white but with a dark area on the face, think and lanky, with a head that came to a slight conic shape At that spot, through the bushes, was a decent sized clearing and then more dark woods that went down a hill Witness and others, including Paul Bartholomew, found 12 inch footprints and a  bedding area nearby the following days It had very long arms that went well below its waist I also realized that if I crossed the road, I would have to take at least 5 strides It growled a few times,  and it's foot steps were really heavy.. The tracks were sort of footlike but very wide At this age I had not ever heard of Bigfoot  Big dark hairy legs, nothing unusual Immediately I noticed that it was completely the same color and it seemed to hold its arms at its side as it moved very, very quickly from left to right I did not really believe in Bigfoot before last night and I am still shaken up and have not been able to share this story with anyone We then looked towards the bushes and a tall thin tree was shaking very fast back and forth I didnt know what it was, but I know for a fact that it wasn't a bear.This figure was dark brown but lighter colored around its shoulders and thighs  Whatever it was stood about 7 feet tall and was covered in brown hair 7 to 9 ft tall Sounded like it was on two feet and moving towards some neighbors houses  I shot at them with my bow to scare them, and the larger one, which must have been 8-8.5 feet tall picked up the smaller one and placed it on its back and walked, not ran, away It looked almost like a bear standing on its hind feet but there is no bears in this part of the state I also reported this to the Western New York bigfoot association and contacted back and forth with thier director Mike George Its arms were, I thought, too long for its body  I told my wife about it that night and we joked about it for a bit saying it must have been Bigfoot It was too far to distinctly see its face but there was a definite darker colored area where the face would have been Judging by nearby trees, I estimated its height to be 6.5 - 7 feet. As I turned, I saw something walking on two feet about 50 yards in front of my car when the first friend moved the thing started off too the woods on 2 feet This occurred no more than 100 feet from where the rock had landed under the tree  I do remember specifically saying for the next two weeks (around the house to my significant other and my daughter only) that [a] bigfoot lived in our backyard. Across from this property was a road, couple mobile homes then a very step wooded foothill (small mountain) Good Day, I am An Avid outdoorsman I have spent my entire Life in the woods Hunting, watching and Tracking Animals & Birds I am writing to you within Minutes of what I have just seen, While out in the Woodlot across from my Residence With My Chesapeake Retreiver we walked for some distance across a frozen Swamp and Ahead of us I seen bare ground so I followed my dog that way she was undisturbed in her activity like she is every day and in front of me I noticed a line of Human shaped Bare foot prints, and I asked myself who in the heck would be out on the ice in their bare feet this time of the year and upon closer inspection there were toes and one one foot a long misshapened toenail I have several pictures on my cell phone and have a knife lying next to the print for size verification, this discovery comes after taking my dog out to use go to the bathroom and hearing what sounded like a stick striking against a tree which I found odd also this i heard three times then it stopped. I listened to the bigfoot vocalizations on this site and can not say that is what I heard either  I have no idea what they were and would need absolute proof that bigfoot existed before I would ever say thats what they were After stopping dead in my tracks I spotted a big flat rock a few feet away Sitting in a car at exactly dusk, my friend saw a tall, brown figure standing along the tree line next to the road, the same side we were on  I looked into a stand of trees and saw a really big dark spot.. I have had a fascination for Bigfoot since I was young, and read about reported sightings, etc., so I am keen to notice things that could be attributed to these possible creatures others might not notice Was it a bigfoot? I can't say that But later, (the next spring) the other boys were talking about a ""monster"" called bigfoot that had been on TV, and for the first time (since that night)I froze again in fear (for a few seconds this time) and somehow knew what they were talking about, and what they were describing. I amassed that this figure had to be standing with in only a few feet of my bedroom window do to the sharpness and size of the shadow  Approximately 6+ feet tall Well last year I was night fishing 9/2010 at Amawalk Reservior SOMERS NY about 30 minutes from PAWLINGS I was fishing with my buddy..the reservior was about 100ft into the lake before you got to water .....about 5am sun was coming out..when a 5 foot maybe 5 1/2 ft man  or Big Foot came out of the woods washed its face and drank some of the reservoir water..he looked like something out of the old school ""Planets of the Apes"" chimps..I said to my buddy ""you see that?""?he said yes ..Now on Animal Planet there showing a clip of a Big Foot that has been seen in these areas (Lower Hudson Valley)..So I'm puzzled to think what I saw was a Big Foot....so this my account of what I saw..and we didn't catch crap at night..anybody ever run into anything like this??..  They were very widely spaced, about 12-14 feet, as if made by something running"
North Carolina,"There was a primate shaped footprint with 5 distinct toes and an overall length of 12 -14 inches by estimate These footprints continued intermittently (because there were patches of rock and solid ice as well as snow)for about a mile and a half of steep trail I learned about the BFRO on Finding Bigfoot show on Animal Planet last night, and wanted to share my story. Mitchell is the highest peak east of the Mississippi River at 6,684 feet, and as a result, the mountain gets heavy snowfalls well into March and sometimes April in the top strand of this about 4 ft off the ground was some long gray hair Its fur was very dark black in color He had big fingers, and hair 4 or 5 inches long all over his body I have seen my father-in-law on the side of the road a few time he stands 6ft 4in and the creature I saw was more then a foot taller and a lot wider. The branches sounded like they could have been as close as 30 feet to as far away as 50 feet to my right THIS DAY WAS NO DIFFERENT  THAN ANY OTHER UNTILL I SAW A LARGE DARK CHESTNUT COLORED OBJECT STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER ABOUT 100 FEET FROM THE BRIDGE  He was starring at me with big dark eyes  I  estimate a height of between 8 and 10 feet  Outside my kitchen window, which is about 8 feet off the ground, the plants are all smashed down like something repeatedly stood there   I was probably about 15-30 feet from it when I saw it As I approached the spot where this happened there was nothing in the road, but standing on the median side of the road was for lack of better understanding a Bigfoot! It was hairy from head to toe and huge I never thought about Bigfoot living in this part of the state, because the surrounding areas are somewhat populated We got out and examined the marks, but it was dark and we couldn't tell much about them It was not a man, no clothing and hairy plus the stride length was insane I also refused to let myself take a picture of the tracks, as that would lend credibility to them in my mind (remember- I was backpacking totally alone and unarmed) It was more apelike than human with deep set brown eyes and a heavy brow ridge i stood there for about a minute trying to see into the darkness of the trees im not sure what we saw what i do know is that it was no bear what we saw was approx 6 to 8 feet tall approx 300lbs As I was ascending the steep switchbacks, I came across a series of large bare human footprints in the snow After all of these years, I now believe it was a ""child"" bigfoot.  On this cold winter morning, with the landscaped dressed in a blanket of white and without any visible signs of being touched by human or animal footprints, she saw what looked like 3 very large humanoid footprints 50 feet down river and saw the same thing  I had been wandering the deeper recesses of the reservation and was quite proud of the fact that not only had I stumbled across old farmsteads that the Marine corps had condemed in order to take the land but had a pretty good supply of discarded C rations it stood on its legs upright like a man.it had long darkish hair hanging from its arms and legs.its head came to kind of a point at the very top of its head.if i had to guess i'd say it stood between 6 1/2 to 7 1/2 feet tall and weighed between 400 and 500 pounds.it turned its head kinda watching me drive by.i hit my brakes but was already passed it,so i went on quickly to the end of the road and turned around.i drove back down the road and as i neared the tree i slowed down and rolled down my window,determined to see what this was,but it was gone.i could not bring myself to get out of the car and inspect the area.at least not then October 2011 we found footprints leading away from our outdoors fire pit  I went to the side porch, which was about 4 feet off the ground, and saw a tuft of off-white fur sticking out from under the porch  The bank beside the road was extremely steep, and it took my friend, who is 6-2 and athletic, eight long strides to climb the bank, but whatever left the prints needed only two steps The hair was reddish brown color and was short from the top of the head getting longer down its body It was mid august of 2012, me and my wife was driving around that night like we did a lot, on our way back to the house we rounded a curve on Ridge Rd in Seagrove NC when my headlights landed on a dark brown/black creature on 2 legs walking into the tree line, the creature had to be at least 7 1/2 ft tall and I would guess about 500+lbs by the width, it was a fast visual As we were starting a fire, we heard something running in the woods, it was heading toward the edge of the woods at an incredible pace, when it was almost through the woods we took off running toward [friend's] house, we were running down a old motorcycle path, it was running through the knee high weeds, it still almost caught up to us, as we looked back it was standing in the fire throwing the logs out, it was at least 8 foot tall, very hairy, we ran to [friend's] house and told our story to his mom, now [friend's] mom had lived on a farm her whole life and wasnt easily scared, she laughed at us, and went outside to get some clothes off the line, a few minutes later she came running in scared to death, she said she had seen something unlike anything she had ever saw, it was huge she said, looked like a monkey of some kind but big, at least 8 foot tall, all that night we could hear it circle the house, it even came onto the porch a couple of times , we were all terrified, to scared to look out, and no phone to call for help, eventually daylight came and it was gone Not only that, but a cousin of mine was driving near the same area in which we saw the Bigfoot about ten years ago He was right beside a pine tree and where he came on the tree he had to be 8 or 9 feet tall The creature turned and stared, it had ice blue eyes, was about seven and half feet tall after we got up we looked at the edge of the woods where it had came out, the branches were broke off up to about 8 feet, after that i read every book on bigfoot At least 7' tall I was watching a television program ( many years later ) on the Discovery Channel about Bigfoot Tall & it's hair was very long & matty Its arms were dropped past its waist About 2 weeks later i was hunting a stream right down from this spot and heard a huge splash in the water and i thought it was a deer so i waited,but never saw anything about 20 minutes later I went up the creek a few hundred feet and in a place in the creek I saw 1 track again on a rock bottom creek very hard my track didn't show up when i crossed the creek but this track 20 plus inches was down about an inch into the hard rockbed bottom of the creek since it was only one track again I didn't bother calling the biologist back,but i saw other signs like stick formations,large patches of vegetation that looked like it had been rolled over by a steam roller,several tracks in the leaves with long strides about 4 feet,found where 2 animals had been killed looked like something put a deer up on a big limb about 8 feet of the ground you coud see the deer hide all over the limb and found where an animal had just been freshly killed one day hunting in there was only person up there that day and something killed an animal near the river it looked like a pile of manure had been steamed rolled into about a four foot wide area on the road about eight feet long and a lot of blood on the ground but no guts and no corpse and that strange smell was there every day.I have hunted a lot of places since i was 5 years old I am 44 now,but this is the only place i have ever hunted that gives me the creeps,I know of a few sighting close to this place,it's not far from the highway 220 incident yall reported and not too far from where the one in Montgomery county was spotted.I don't care to be interviewed by the media please but i believe I can show you where you can actually find Bigfoot I wanted to let you know about a sighting of Bigfoot I had in North Carolina and completely covered in hair it was not solid black it was more of a dark brownish grey in color  He seemed to be comunicating with me though his eyes no cars were out only us, we see in our headlights about 150 feet ahead a dark brown hair covered animal crossing the road very slowly  The hair was a lighter brownish color and appeared long in its length and i remember thinking at the time what kind of animal around here has hair like this It's eyes I recall is what scared me the most I want to report a sighting of a huge Bigfoot  It was around 8:45 pm so it was still light, sort of dusk dark My partner was a fast mover and was ahead, I was moving slowly to avoid slipping in the shallow creek when I observed a distinct down stream pointed bare footprint in a patch of silty sand just off the shore Years later in the late seventies, more and more was on TV about what is now known as Bigfoot  The dogs in the area would absolutely go nuts!  He has night vision and just as soon as he gets outside, he hears the footsteps slowly moving away it was about 4 mabey 5 in of hair on each side of the barb I don't think it was human because it was an area that has no farms, homes or anything on it and it is just wilderness, also it was dark from head to toe and it appeared to us that it did not want us to see it. The face resembled a man, much lighter than the rest of him, but his body was covered in dark hair  ; )  it did, however, sound a lot like some of the purported sasquatch/bigfoot vocalizations i've heard on some websites i've checked out.  There was no hair on the face which was a bit lighter in complexion than the fur surrounding it. The next day my wife and I look around the area for any sign of foot print or the branches themselves I got down the road about 1/8 mile and turned around in a local church parking lot, when I got back, there was another vehicle turned into the dirt path, I slowed down and rolled my windows down, and the lady asked me ""Do you see that thing?"" which I didn't see it anymore, she then pointed, I looked, and it was walking on two legs into the tree line It stopped about 30 feet from us I am convinced that what I saw as a child was in fact, a Bigfoot or sasquatch It was getting very cold so we got into the car, cranked the car up and started to back up and leave when a very dark large figure ran across the road into the woods  We were driving down a road to go to out cabin in the forest and we saw a large (about 6 or 7 feet.) ape like creature walking down the hill in front of out car About 15 ft below the sand bar on our side I was walking across some of these big rocks to fish this next hole.When I looked between the rocks and saw one BIG foot print in the wet creek bank sand FROM MY ESTIMATION IT WAS OVER 7 FOOT TALL ITS HAIR WAS NOT LONG AND SHAGGY OR NASTY LOOKING , ITS FACE SEEMED NOT TO HAVE MUCH HAIR ON IT FROM MY POINT OF VIEW.IT HAD A PHYSICAL APPEARANCE OF A LARGE MAN, ITS LEGS WERE VISABLE FROM THE WATER TO ITS HIPS, ITS ARMS WERE LONGER THAN A NORMAL MAN THEY SEEM TO BE DOWN TO ITS KNEES FROM THE SIDE I SAW IT FROM WHEN IT TURNED TO LOOK AT ME ITS HEAD SEEMED TO BE EGGED SHAPED AT THE TOP AND ITS CHEST FROM THE SIDE WHEN IT TURNED TOWARD ME IT WAS COVERED IN HAIR This deer stand was about 10 feet high in a tree the sounds were, or it seemed only a matter of feet away Eyes were opened wide and mouth  In May 2004 I came home late, about midnight, and as I was exiting the car, I heared a the classic bigfoot scream way out in the distance, maybe half a mile away    (Busick is so small that google earth does not have a marker for it.)   On the first of the two nights we were there, we heard wierd yells going through the woods right after dark  The hair was straight and laid flat against its body and seemed to vary in length from a couple inches to maybe 5 inches  But instead I saw a creature that was taller than me, and I was standing on the porch It seemed aggressive at first, but it did not get any closer than 30 feet I knew then it was not a bear after I saw it walking on two legs like a human I KNOW WHAT I SAW ONE NOVEMBER DAY ABOUT 3:30PM ON A SUNNY DAY STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF LINVILLE RIVER ABOUT A MILE FROM THE LINVILLE WILDERNESS AND FALLS AREA WAS NOT A BEAR , THIS IS MY ENCOUNTER WITH BIGFOOT I WAS DRIVING MY TRUCK ON MY WAY HOME AND WAS CROSSING LINVILLE RIVER BRIDGE AS I DO MANY TIMES ON MY WAY FROM MY JOB I ALWAYS LOOK DOWN THE RIVER BECAUSE IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL SHE SAID IT MOVED SO FAST SHE COULDN'T TELL EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS , BUT IT WAS TALL ENOUGH THAT SHE COULD SEE THE HEAD & SHOULDERS  As best I can remember we were close to Candor NC, where 211 toward Pinehurst and Aberdenn NC comes together though it is a very rural area farms and woods  It appeared tall over 7 foot and had long arms walking upright I remember trying to get my legs to start running but it was like I was frozen  The passenger rear quarter panel  was dented in with hair on it Then about 100 yards away from that I heard another commotion and more heavy footfalls running toward the 1st  Its arms hung almost down to its knees  Almost everyone in the neighborhood was affected, in that we would hear footsteps, twigs snapping, and one neighbor heard scratching on the side of the house The face was hair covered like a mans beard and lighter in color.  We couldn't believe our eyes  Who or what has a foot that big and who or what would be out in this weather barefooted. One thing I remember thinking was strange about the way it walked --  it swung it's arms as it walked by, like pendulums. At about 7pm I heard heavy footfalls, a knock in a pattern of 5 or 6 knocks They were large also and had a bright brown appearance and I never took my eyes off him  Very short hair on its face, and the skin shone through At one point, the animal had stepped over a fallen branch approximately three feet off the ground without breaking stride We had crossed the river and walked about 200 yards to the gates when we were startled by a scream that made the hair on my neck stand up We were not invited, so get the heck out of there! I was now ready for a hasty retreat as my legs started to finally move and the brain cramp I experienced seemed to lessen  It was large, maybe 8 ft., covered in black hair or fur  I had my headlights on cruising about 60 mph  when I rounded a corner and there in the road stood this large hairy thing Immediately after hearing this sound my eyes shot open and my nephew who was still cracking sticks around the fire froze in silence The hairs on the back of my neck stood up!!! I don't know what it was I followed it with my eyes and as the sun reached in front of my tree stand a small, 3 ft., black, furry creature reared up from a sleeping position and ran away from the sun   I only saw it for about 10-15 seconds(maybe, I was so scared it could've been 5 seconds or it could have been a minute), and the best way to describe it would be that it looked like the bigfoot from Harry and the Hendersons only it was heavier and a little bit darker  The creature I saw was massive; maybe 7 to 8 feet tall and I'd estimate 600 Lbs or more They said it came within five feet of their car  It was so tall that I had to lean closer to the steering wheel to look up into its face Because of the tree tops, I could only see the top half of the body, but I would estimate it to be at least seven feet tall There was an old car parked on the side of the road, so I could hardly see to turn left, so when I did, I drove for maybe 10-15 seconds when I saw eyes in front of me (it was about 9:15 in the PM) I turned lights on bright and I thought it was a homeless man walking along the road, but seeing someone walking down here when its dark is unlikey, I slow down ,I didn't know if it was gonna cross the road , I was driving about 35  in a 45 mph zone Imagine if my head is 12 o’clock and my feet are 6 o’clock, these branches were being broken at 11-12 o’clock or over my right shoulder  I was about 25 feet away from the thing and the smell was horrible  It literally looked as it came from no where and went no where, because the footprints did not leave a trail Keep in mind that he hadn't ever heard of Bigfoot before  Now I was going 60 +- miles an hour it was so fast it looked like it was gliding sort of and swinging it's arms It was covered in long brown to black hair It looked to be about 8 foot tall, and just unbelievably massive in the chest and shoulder areas I saw a bigfoot and I have pictures of its foot prints These tracks seemed to cross over a split rail fence in one stride i looked over and saw something standing on two feet looking at me .this thing was approx  I also mimicked the gait to see if I could guess-timate about how tall the individual was The shape of the head was that of a man with a mullet hair cut, so you couldn't make out the contour of the back of the head, it sort of went straight down   He told me about it the next day and I got kind of scared, since I may have seen a bigfoot in New Mexico back in 1994 while in the boy scouts  I look down to insure my footing when I caught a glimpse of something off to my right between me and the river The mottling was not in highly contrasted colors,but simply darker shades of brown,and slightly lighter shades of brown.Maybe it was the effect of the sun filtering through the leaves This Property was set back away from the closest road about a 1/2 mile on foot, before you even got to the cabins they owned These cabins were on stilts, like a beach house about 10 foot high, with stairs And we all heard loud footfalls running away from the fallen tree. As I got closer I noticed it was not a man, it was something else, like a bear walked up right with long legs and arms longer than a man, had dark hair, I couldn't really see the color very well I'd be interested to know if Bigfoot really could exist in a coastal woodlands area, rather than the mountainous regions that the creature is normally associated with. It was extremely tall, had hair all over it's body and it's arms were really long I only caught a glimpses of its face, as its back was to me, and it looked hairy except around the eyes His arms were down beside him At first I thought it was a deer or a bear passing by but I know what they sound like as they walk (a couple months ago I was face to face with a mother bear and her cubs), but I never actually heard distinct footsteps and as the breaking didn’t move in location I became a little freaked out   The next day the two brothers went on a long hike and I stayed in camp since I was experiencing foot problems and had no hiking boots SHE SAID IT WAS TOO TALL TO BE HUMAN I'm 6' 4"" and no way I could have a stride that long its hard to say how tall they were mabey 5 ft mabey 6 ft  The house is set on thirty wooded acres with a creek about twenty-five feet away On the back porch, the fence was still shaking and we heard footsteps crashing to our left So Saturday I set up my hammock 20-30 feet into the woods just outside our site  The footprints were so large I could almost stand in it It's arms were swinging I saw a tall,(in comparison to the reeds,which grow at least 4-6 ft tall)figure moving away from me,and it appeared to be dark,and sort of mottled in color It shook its shoulders and stretched with its arms raised above its head, almost like a human waking from a nap Coming up from the river bottom was a huge dark mass  I missed by a couple of feet  We listened to a few songs; when we decided to play the Sierra Sounds cd with bigfoot recordings on it One day some friends and myself were out for a drive in Carteret County,NC in the early afternoon, we were on this two-track road called FR-144 outside Havelock,NC when we came around this bend in the road we all saw something very strange, a very large, dark figure walking on two legs toward us about 75 yards away, it was only for a few seconds because whatever this was turned and walked straight into the woods I never associated this sound with 'bigfoot', until now The hairs on my arm and back of my neck stood up straight I have never in my life been so afraid. Since there was about 50 or 60 feet distance between me & ""the bear"" I decided to pull of to the side of the road & watch him for a minute It then started running, and cleared a 10 foot creek in one leap Witnesses observed 12 to 16 inch (approx.) length tracks in the shape of a foot about 5-6 feet apart in 21 inches of snow It was dark and we noticed we were running low on fire wood I am 6’1” and was about 4 feet higher up the ridge yet could almost look eye to eye with the creature  It had long hair all over that appeared all over the body and the hair must have been 6 plus inches  You could literally see the 5 toes with foot and toe imprints in the snow When I was walking I had a funny feeling and the hair on my neck and arms stood up Then we heard a loud crack like a rifle shot from the direction of the footsteps  At dusk she saw something very large on 2 feet standing at the edge of our woods   It was about 7 to 7.5 feet high, reddishbrown matted looking hair,  its face was hairless and he looked ticked I heard this myself, usually when I was out hunting, it would be around early evening just starting to get dark, id be walking back to my home to my house when id notice everything would get very quiet, then suddenly it would let out a bone chilling scream that sent me scurrying as quickly as possible to my home My buddy, sleeping on the floor a few feet away, was not awakened by the sound She described it as dark in color and on two legs The prints were apparently made by a bipedal animal, and led up a steep bank and disappeared over the top of the bank about 75 yards up the slope I HAVE NOT TOLD MY ENCOUNTER WITH BIGFOOT TO ANYBODY OUTSIDE MY FAMILY AND FEW FRIENDS  All I could see were footprint indents That night I couldn't sleep and the next morning I got up and went back there, no foot prints or anything because it is so dry here from no rain.I haven't seen it since but it's only been a few days He was at least 7ft tall or more with silver and black hair some of it at least 4 to 5 inches long and dark outdoors type skin (where it was exposed It had to be at least 8-9 feet tall, covered in long black hair all over it's body MY WIFE WAS AT THE KITCHEN WINDOW WASHING HER HANDS WHEN SHE HOLLERED ""WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT.""   SHE SAID SOMETHING LARGE AND DARK JUST RUN PAST THE WINDOW ABOUT 15 FEET OUT They looked dark black in color and relatively hairless except the back of the hand was hairy  The hair was darker the closer to the body it was In quick order, first the right taillight then the reflective material in the middle then the left tail light went dark and came back on It was not a bear, it was standing on two legs and had arms and hands The nose was flat to the face and the lips were very thin and general skin tone was dark I heard heavy thudding footsteps pass my window and what must have been at least two or more dogs following and barking.I was terrified for several nights after.I did mention it to my mother As my brother and I got a little older we started reading up on Bigfoot sightings and stories in books when we were still about 8 and 10 years old We could see where it had tried to wipe ash off on rocks and then took long strides across the yard It's shoulders were massive with a very short neck and more gray hair than black hair on his back that seemed to be about 2-3 in  THE NEXT EVENING I WENT OUT TO FEED MY DOGS AND NOTICED A 20 TO 30 FOOT SAPLING , IT HAD TWO MAIN TRUNKS , ONE IS BENT OVER THE OTHER HAD BEEN SNAPPED ABOUT 3 FOOT FROM THE GROUND It was large and hair covered, looking at me and I was frozen in place i quickly turned in the direction that i thought the sounds to be coming from and for a moment thought i caught a glimpse of something standing beside a tall tree along the treeline I told my husband that it is a Bigfoot!!! In a panic I drove away and my husband insisted that we turn around and go back I hesitated about posting this report until I read the most recent postings about the vocalizations, especially the sightings of a bigfoot up in a tree  My legs had to spread 4-5 feet apart just to keep in step with the prints It was taller that my dad who was around six foot and it was a lot bigger than him We tried to rule out every other possiblity but big foot but they didnt work out to good I was deer hunting not to far from Angola Bay Game Land in Duplin County NC I was walking through the woods by the Northeast Cape Fear River and observed a red tinted figure approximately 8 to 9 ft tall it looked like it was taking a drink of water I was so frozen by what I was seeing I couldn't move from the shock they were taller than any 4 legged wild animals that lives around here.that was the last i have or heard from these things Just stood there and looked at me and blinked some and make jesters with his head and eyes I've heard footsteps crunching through the heavy layer of dried leaves on the forest floor I slowed down in order to avoid hitting it should it go down on all four legs and flee  I looked streight into his eyes I couldn't tell you what color the eyes were  It rained all day so the night seemed darker than usual It looked to be about 9 to 10 feet tall with a very heavy muscular structure and weighing about 800 lbs after going back inside, i finished getting ready for work, went outside, as i was walking to my suv i could here twigs breaking from the footsteps I know sometimes big cats can leave footprints that appear to be two-legged, and there are still some panthers (mountain lions) left in the mountains of North Carolina, but if a cat made these marks it would have to have been the biggest panther in the world He said it was definately walking on two feet and it was not a person I can only describe this as similar to the noise a deer makes when it’s alerting other deer to danger, but if a deer were to make this noise it would have to be 20 feet tall I'd say about 6-8 foot tall and as wide as a refrigerator Only bigfoot or whatever you call him will let you get a glimpse, you just have to be ready! The short hair on the body was thinner and around five inches long  There in the snow were 3 very, very large humanoid footprints  I looked into the Bigfoot phenomena by purchasing the book “Bigfoot” by Ann Slate and Alan Berry We heard some rustling from behind our tent as we turned around to look there was a Bigfoot just standing there looking at us and we were looking back at him It had dark brown hair that was longer on its head and arms than the legs, chest and stomach The arm hair was much longer at eighteen inches and it made sense, the strong smell of urine, which we smelled before it came out of the woods, and the figure we saw, ive never told this before except to family but it is true and i have no doubt it was bigfoot. we looked at each other as if to see if the other was seeing the same thing i leaned forward in my seat to see if it was a bear, about that time we realized it was walking on two legs and was kinda side stepping and it was staring right at us  The mass continued in our direction taking long strides and ignoring the small trees, brush, and briars in its path, as if they were not there Had the footprints been there as I was heading out, I would have photographed them.  it was not quite totally dark yet, but was past ""dusk"", and the moon was visible, though hazy, in sky She said it was behind the basketball net and almost as tall as bottom of the net I cannot forget those ice blue eyes. As I looked out at the starry sky I was shocked, if not terrified, to see the dark outline of a strange figure walking past the window  It had to be at least 7 feet tall, covered in an off-white fur - except for an oval around the face the road turned to dirt and gravel about half way up it.about 35 to 40 feet after i dropped off the pavement,i noticed something standing beside a big tree.at first i thought it was a bear maybe scratching itself on the tree,but as i got closer it didnt run off.i've drove up on bears before and they always ran off.except this animal didn't run,it just kinda of watched me go by.it was about dusk dark and i really couldn't make it out that well I could clearly see its face, body, feet and hands One other thing to note is that my impression was that the creature was clean in the sense that its hair was not matted nor in tuffs  For one thing, his feet aren't that large, and the prints could have been from a size 14 or 15 shoe, and why in the world would he be walking around at night in the middle of a snowstorm?  For another thing, he is not THAT tall; I put my heavy hiking boot, woman's size 9, up next to the prints and they could have swallowed my boots 2 1/2 times My first thought was “I’ve never heard a bird fly through the trees and hit limbs and leaves like that! Why is it doing that?” So as I stand there puzzled and confused I hear more commotion coming through the tree tops! This time my eyes focus on the sound and I see a rock about the size of a Jr sized football flying over my head and on the bank on the other side of the creek! As I stand there stunned, racking my brain try to make sense of it, I unsnap my 9mm and shout in that direction “You stay over there and I’ll stay over here!” Needless to say I packed up and left, feeling like I’m being watched the whole time! I threw my stuff in the back of my truck and hauled buggy out of there! I don’t know of any animal in the woods that can throw a rock that big that far! I was so effected that I gave up gold panning and hunting for the most part! I never told the land owner or anybody else for that matter for a few years We spotted a tall hairy figure crossing the road ahead of us I asked him if it could have been a horse wandering from the above horse camp or a bear and he said it was walking on two feet like a man but had to be much larger because of the amount of noise of the breaking branches and leaves As it looked at us with yellowish looking bloodshot eyes, it snapped the old dead oak off at the ground and made a loud grunting bark His eyes resembled that of a dogs and were the color of a alaskain husky and wide flat nose and a wide thin mouth like a mans At the edge of the mountain where the cornfield began, there Bigfoot stood about 30 to 40 feet away from me I sort of felt that maybe it could have been a bigfoot but both my wife and dad described it as being up in the trees behind the tent Someone had made a recording of a bigfoot 30 to 40 feet away at most (I am remembering all of this through a child's eyes but my mom remembers the same accounts) Eyes were brown and looking me up and down I decided to walk back to the base of the trail head and within twenty foot steps back down the trail I heard something huff at me from over my left shoulder"
North Dakota,"Verytall It fixed me with it's eyes and stood up onit's hind legs when it saw that it had been seen I got a real good closelook, long black shiny hair, oily looking, and it rose from all fours onto it's hind feet.(I am certain it had followed us for some time) As they got to one of my cousins house they went and wroke my Uncle up and told him that they saw big foot Then they drove to my house and wroke me up, so i said them ""yeah right like you seen a big foot around here"" By the time the kids told it was dark, my Uncle and I drove back there and found nothing, the next day Sept 10 we tried to find the path where this thing or big foot crossed, we are still looking for signs or even better prints NO Luck they weren't there so that was the end of the search or hunt, until Sept 9 when 6 kids saw a tall black thing running on two legs heading West on BIA 1 just 1/2mi North of White Shield, I talked to the kids and the said when it was running in the field it was black and on two legs and as it crossed the road it took 3 steps and it was on the other side No hair on the face above it's nose or the palms of it's hands Foot prints where found in the bad lands of North Dakota near Mandaree. (My father was working for the Department of the Air Force onthe Missile site Installations at the time.) After walking back from somedistance out on the prairie, I had the distinct feeling that someone orsomething was following us We stoped a BIA officer and told him that we found some imprssions so he came out there and took some pictures, the foot prints pointed in a East direction as we started to track them we found 3 other sets that seemed like they were zigziging around, after an 30min or so we track it to a tree row where it seemed that there were spots of cut hay put into piles and pine tree branches 2in thick snaped off, the sap still ozzing out from the break, and sunflower or tall weeds stems in that spot, there was no tall weeds around that spot, so we walked around and found a slew just at the end of the tree row about 200yards away, had the same stems from the weeds Longarms They were about 2-3 miles from home on Counrty Road 7 when they said that they were just talking and notice on the left side in the North bound lane a large brown hairy 7-8ft tall thing was standing there, they said they were going about 50-55mph and slowed down a bit, as they passed by it they taped on the brake and in the brake lights they saw it and punched it back home, they said they were so scared that they were going aleast 90mph to get back I was on the passenger side and my Uncle was driving we were both looking around with the lights when I picked up a bright RED reflection of eyes, as i told my Uncle to stop i notice that this thing was on all fours  moving west towards us and then it stop and what looked like it sat down, i mean it looked like a gorrilla from the movies As we stoped and sat there we must of been watching it for about 3-5mins, It seemed unreal to me but as i started to realize that this is happing and that we don't have gorrilla's in North Dakota that is when my Uncle notice two more sets of eyes behind the one we were watching, my cousins started screaming and cussing at us to leave and to get the Cops and Game & Fish, so after that we started to turn around and head back in i noticed it stood up that's when i said hurry up lets get Game & Fish out here"

Ohio,"on a dark night HIS EYES WERE ON ME AT ALL TIMES.I CONTINUED TO RELEASE THE OTHER DOG.I DIDNT KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT It was about seven feet tall or taller The yoke was about 12 feet long and to heavy for me to lift Chest was large and barrel like, arms longer than that of a man, stout thick legs To this day, we both are leery of being in the backyard after dark Large foot prints about 18"" long and 6-7"" wide about 3-4"" deep and also small juvenile prints around 11-12"" When we got close to where we had just saw it the hair was standing straight up on the back of my neck, I was sweating profusely, and I was scared to death When I was about twenty feet away from the camping area, the continuous screaming ended I look online to see if any Bigfoot sightings had been reported in this area and found none I told him we should go into the woods a little deeper just to see what else we can find and I walked back up to the deer trail and just for curiosity I went to the spot where I previously stood to look down to the large tree where we both seen that dark object and this time the area looked different The spring of that same year while walking around Lake White just north of a residential area I saw what I believe to be a Bigfoot We found footprints one winter that were very wide at the heel and very large in size like 17-20 inches long  Then the tall big-eyed creature’s eyes started to sway back and forth The next day after seeing the tracks near the garbage dumpster area I was convinced it was a Bigfoot At the sound of my movement, the figure swung its head around to look directly at me and leapt to its feet, coming up out its crouch and turning to face us in a single, smooth movement When we arrived at the lake we set up a small fire and our sleeping bags on a small knoll overlooking the lake and then went down the hill to an old road and walked about a mile or so when my friend Darren found a large footprint in the clay-like mud off the side of the road, we all were amazed at how big this print was, I wear a size 12 boot and it was at least 4 inches longer than my boot It's arms were real long and hung almost to the ground Bigfoot reminds me of a Heron Bird, you can never get too close to it and it quickly takes off to hide Two large white hairy creatures  What we saw plain as day was covered in reddish brown hair, walked upright, had a conical shaped head, long arms, stocky build and was at least six feet tall We decided to hunt anyway and all kinda joked about it being a couple of bigfoots and how if one of them came by our treestand we would kick it in the teeth In fact is seems people are quicker to believe in making money with get rich overnight schemes than the existence of bigfoot I HAVE SEEN THIS CREATURE THREE TIMES IN MY LIFE TIME.EACH TIME I HAVE ENCOUNTERED THIS ANIMAL BIGFOOT I GOTTEN A CHANCE TO GET CLOSER AND FINALLY A UNDERSTANDING OF ITS NATURE It scared me and Sadie so bad we took off running and i dont think i felt the ground under my feet i was running so fast mind you that there is a city-type streetlight post right beside the lane about middle ways between my house and my buddies house, so it wasnt really dark necessarily  It was very tall, with big arms Almost in a panic, I picked up several rocks and pitched them in the direction of the eyes We both thought it was a little strange that someone would walk in the snow barefooted She could not make out any facial features due to the amount of long hair covering its face We finally made it to the small creek and jumped across and headed across the field with the tall grass as we kept looking behind us to see if we were being followed but didn't notice anything I could see it had very long reddish hair and I really couldn’t fathom what it was  At 2:08 am I heard loud crashing foot steps coming from the right side of the woods down the hill in front of me  As the foot falls got closer, the sound of breaking twigs were heard with every step I could see the fur hanging from its arms as it reached out to touch the pasture fence in a posture more like a man  It was too dark in there and it was the middle of the day  After that I went and put my chair in the dark area of the overhang, and blocked the light from the lantern so it would not shine on me or get in my eyes Why someone would let their child run around barefoot in December in cold water and mud is beyond me? Still not sure what to make of this We were staring at each other, then it kinda wrinkled up its nose and its eyes narrowed i went camping with a friend on labor day weekend in 1998.we were camping in wayne national forrest.on the third night of the camp out,i kept hearing twigs snapping out in the woods.i would shine my flash light out in the woods periodically.at 3:30 am i finally caught a bigfoot in light with it's back to me.it was about 50 feet out in the woods.it was about 7 foot tall.it had fur that was about 3 inches long.the collor was that of a cockerspaniel dog.an off collor of blond and brown.after a minute and a half,i thougt bigfoot would take off running because it was noticed by the light!but what it did next freaked me out,it crouched down and went to a deffensive mode.i then ran to get my gun.but when i arrived back to look for it it was gone.after the encounter i went out in the woods to look for foot prints  or evidence .but i did not find any.  The animal head we saw looked sort of like a primates, a large head with 4-6 inches of long silvery or gray hair but I don't recall much detail of the nose or mouth at the time, only a huge head that filled the window of the door 6/17/13- Salt Fork State Park Bigfoot Ridge It ran too fast and was too tall for it to be a man  As walked, we both agreed that not many humans have feet that big nor would they be roaming the woods in sub-freezing temperatures and running through chilly creeks My father, never one to believe in Bigfoot blew it off as a hoax or joke until he saw them with his own eyes I was around 30 yards from the turn off for Hosak's Cave when I saw a hairy, brown figure move into the brush on the right side of the road I don't know if you believe me or not? I know what I saw so many years ago.You don't forget it......and for as much as I've ever glued myself to anything regarding Bigfoot, I know they exist, and I believe they are peaceful I got in my truck and drove up there, turned my lights on where it went in to the woods, and I saw two yellow eyes glowing at me, and then they were gone I leaned forward peering into the darkness for a better look Bigfoot was an unknown concept It was the same general location that I first noticed the large dark thing As we were finally getting through the thick woods behind our house and walking into our property, there stood a Bigfoot staring the other way I jumped up, and saw a dark very muscular figure hurrying off quickly in the direction diagonal to our site and our camping neighbor  The sound of the foot steps was like a huge thing moving thru the woods The footprints started to turn and walk up the fence post in the direction they had come There were no trail-signs, no hair, nothing that would indicate a track  The stride was long and I had to strech to walk the same path The figure was at least as large as a man, if not bigger, and was completely black (or dark in color) This dark figure was following the deer trail that are 40 yards east of the trail cam To me, it was a Bigfoot The hair was about one inch long on the face and it sweptback from the brow with a large lump standing up on the top of the head As we watched while approaching it, its arms were long and swaying as it walked across the road in long strides As I slowed down to see what it was, it came out of the creek bed on two legs and it ran right towards our car It was about Bigfoot legends from around the US and they happened to play a clip from a unknown howling recorded in Columbiana County, Ohio in 1994 It then ran along the side of our car (five feet away) for a few seconds During Jim's first visit he found four more footprints near the original footprint It was very tall and it was covered in a brownish fur He saw a very large, very tall, bipedal creature running toward the road from the left hand side It was geting dark outside so my mom told us to stay inside and play  Since it was filtered light I realized that it couldn't be a deer that was sillhouetted dark, because the sun wasn't right for that It was about 7 feet tall, 4 feet across the shoulders and covered with dark brown hair that was about 4 inches long It didn't look like what I thought a Bigfoot would look like I looked down to the tree which was about a good three hundred feet and I noticed something dark that seemed to be squatting behind that tree but I couldn't tell what it was but I know it wasn't moving so I dismissed it as a log or tree stump He played the light around on the ground as though searching for something, but the ground was hard clay and didn't show any footprints; although the heavy dew on the sparse grass between the can and the embankment had been disturbed Until that time neither my dad or me suspected a Bigfoot, nor had we heard of anything like it As we were walking, we were startled when a figure jumped out of a tree no more then 20-30 feet in front of us in the direction we were headed It did not look at me but took the road in two more steps and was across and gone into the woods beside a home's driveway..it happened so quick it was surreal .All I could do was look at my daughter whose face was in total shock..she started saying .oh my god mom that was really a bigfoot..I cant believe we just saw an actual bigfoot. Later that morning after we woke I was convinced it was a bigfoot and set out to look for tracks, fur, broken sticks, the usual signs I called the police to show them the footprints and the police laughed at me  So after several minutes of nature watching, (I have three photographs), I decided to go forward and as I put the car into gear, about 250 feet ahead of me I saw a big black creature leap from the hillside into the ravine We could see in the lights reflection two bright pink eyes looking back at us Everyone was talking about Bigfoot; some in a joking manner, while others were seriously trying to track the creature down He told us that a few years ago a news crew showed up at this lake to do a report on a ""Bigfoot"" sighting I remember thinking that it was awfully odd that someone would allow their child to run around barefoot during the winter, especially in an area that was littered with random fish hooks and broken glass Then, there it was, ""a bear"" I said!! I raised my shot gun and fired it in the air but it didn't stop coming towards us (it was on two legs the whole time) The size of the legs were enormous but the hand looked like it could completely wrap around a basketball They claimed to have seen a large hairy monster in the pit We were driving over the bridge of the little Miami river and I saw this dark figure standing in the middle of the river If we found Bigfoot though, it sure would be the catch of the century! The world would change dramatically if we were able to study them closely In the late 70's we had our cornfield smashed down and a partial footprint was found A footprint that was 11 1/2"" long, 6"" at the ball and 3"" at the heel was discovered on a sandbar and cast rifle at the eyes still shining back at me I was in High School in 1986 and we just came home from an away football game and were cruising around town late one night, about 12:30 or so  It was completely white and must have been about 7 feet tall  I went and sat down in a chair and turned on the the portable radio about half volume Buy the way the creature was probably seven feet tall or better The very first time out there, I found a three toed foot print about 14 inches long and about 6 inches wide About a year ago I watched ""Sasquatch, Legend Meets Science"" and as soon a I heard the supposed Bigfoot vocalizations and realized that there were sightings all across the country I believed that the sounds we heard and the presence I encountered could very well have been a Sasquatch  There was one set of very large, close together, blue-white eyes high off the ground  They were totally unthreatening looking – in fact, my impression was of a gentle and frightened creature I looked up the hill and about 50 feet up the hill was what looked like a six foot tall black man but the thing about that scared the shit out of me and luke is that it was black all over and i mean black not brown black It stood upright like a man but had longer dark hair and a face sorta small looking from the hair and a slightly pointed head towards the back We sat there for about 30 minutes, talking away as women do and I mentioned that I watched a Bigfoot show on tv and we should do ""bigfoot calls"" a few hundred feet from him Well I covered my eyes and began counting and my sisters went and hid throughout our hike my sister and i heard grunts and would see tall figures but weren't positive of what they were. They were about eight feet in height and muscular It made every hair on my body stand up ,even hairs I didn't know I had, I even cried But I got a great look at them they were black as coal and the hair length was as long as a bear and well groomed Sitting/squatting on the edge of the little drop into the ravine was a brown-furred Bigfoot It had black fur and the hair was a bit longer on its head then the rest of the body So I started breaking preparing for a deer to jump out but instead a full leg then body came out and stepped in my sight into the road..as I looked I realized it was a bigfoot creature about 8 foot tall covered in long brown fur, very thin  I then found one spot going up the hill that was a footprint of the front of the toes.the toes were probably an inch wide each and in line together unlike a humans front toes that are angled  While hiking on the paths we seen what looked to be a bigfoot print in the mud on the path that we was on  This is just very strange to see something like this, I'm not saying it was Bigfoot but this area is a real hotbed for sightings in Ohio I did a perimeter check and came across an extremely large footprint That same day about a mile away in a field I found all types of bones spread about in a 20 foot diameter My husband told me a couple months back when he was looking for my sisters dog, he saw what appeared to be deer fur strewn around an area no bones or anything but the deer hair and it looked really strange I walked closer to see what it was and there was a creature about seven to eight feet tall standing and it was staring me down The strides stopped, I looked up, Melody asked if I heard that, I nodded and put my free finger to my lips, indicating quiet, I was trying to fix the exact location The arms were very long and although the creature walked upright, the hands (as the creature walked) hung almost to it's knees We got really nervous and a little scared because we all had a lot of experience in the woods hiking and hunting and none of us had ever believed or seen anything about Bigfoot, but We changed our minds very quickly after seeing that print It was a side view, so I did not see the eyes It was hairy, but we were driving 45, so I can't get detailed I do not see a reason why a human would be walking through a field in deep snow barefoot I went out and did find some very large bare feet tracks by our house in some mud I felt the hair raise on the back of my neck, reliving these moments in my mind  He said it was black and even though it was dark he saw the outline of the face  It didn't swing its arms around like a gorilla, but had features similar, from what I could tell It was very large with a chest about 3 feet wide and stood about 7 to 8 feet tall When it walked it looked slumped over and we could see its arms moving as it walked out of the woods and through my neighbors yard I noticed its shoulders were extremely wide and when it walked, it made strides that were very non human like in proportion The two days before this incident I was walking on a trail and found a series of human-like footprints leading down the trail in the same direction I was traveling (west) I was totally amazed how lighting quick he was The Bigfoot long brown hair on him, but not too thick as it was possible to see some skin under his fur  Halfway down this large creature I saw several smaller blue-white eyes  I did take a picture of the print with my daughter's foot next to it. When I looked up on the bank there was what I thought a man walking in the field...but as i looked I saw it was very big, and hairy As I turned my head (we were traveling about 65 mph...so we went by quickly)...I could SWEAR I saw this very tall ""image"" walking from right to left across this mountain side, maybe 30 yards from our car! He(IT) appeared to be covered somewhat with snow, like you would imagine a mountainman who was out in the wilderness hunting would look It was setting to the right and forward of a large rock overhand that went back about 20 feet Then it stood up! It was at least seven feet tall or more I have recently taken up an interest in Bigfoot, and after some books on the subject began to wonder whether the sound I heard was perhaps one of the creatures I believe what we encountered must have been a Bigfoot I shone my light between some trees, and bam, got some bright eyeshine right back – not the red eyeshine you so often read about, but bluish-white, I think We went down to the creek (Twin Creek in Preble county) to fish and saw a big footprint in a sandbar that was way too big to be human First was a very strange set of 3-hoofed or 3-toed prints that we found and my 10 yr.old daughter followed with her feet down a path and into the woods coming away from a large lake people fish at alot  Estimated height was 8 feet tall and the creature appeared very ‘Bulky' from the side view We both said no back then but as time has gone by we have found small trees broken off above 10 feet and footprints that only it could make so we thought we should make this report However, she dug a tunnel about 8 feet into the ground At the time I had never heard of bigfoot and my child mind had to make sense of it somehow so we told our parents a black man threw rocks at us It had brown hair all over its body and just stared at us The marina was located on the western shore of the lake in an area surrounded by dense woodland punctuated by small farms and was accessed by a two-lane, tar and asphalt, road that followed the western shoreline This cry so primal and terrifying it made the hair on the back of both of our necks stand strait up with fear got clear of the boat cover and straightened up to shine his flashlight on the scene about the time that the figure leapt into the tall brush My guess would be at least 7' tall It was definitely black or dark colored Then a rock that was about 6 inches wide came tumbling down on the ground of this steep cliff along with dry leaves falling behind it. So I looked up and about 15-20 feet away I saw the left side of a foot, calf, thigh, and hip of an animal We think there is a Bigfoot that lives somewhere in the woods or passes through regularly where we camp, fish, and hunt The figure appeared to be approximately 7 feet tall which I estimated was a foot taller than me.  The toes were very strange and appeared to be much longer than a humans, the left foot looked like it had suffered an injury to two of the interior toes Jim stated that the other footprints were about four feet spread apart from each other He didn't have more of a flatter face but slightly darker colored and thick skinned like an ape While traveling at 55-60 mph  I saw what appeared to be a tall being covered with brown hair I had been told about recent Bigfoot sightings in this area, so I’d been on the lookout for Bigfoot and sign ever since We pulled the boat cover in place, fastening all but about the three feet at the stern that we would use to get back into the boat, and Mr As long as eight feet apart he said On the other side of the tracks there was an embankment that rose about three or four feet high The ears were covered with hair and it was standing at an angle to us but I could see the legs were extremely muscular and large and the arms length seemed to go just slightly past the knees It was a huge, hairy creature, very smelly, over six feet in height and dark brown in color The fur on its arms was rather long It was when I found out about Bigfoot sightings in Ohio that I actually put the incident and Bigfoot together This leg looked like a bodybuilder's leg with short black hair and was about 3-4 feet in length I saw a shadow of a beast, about 50 feet away from the edge of the field... The head came to a slight point at the top, eyes seemed smallish and would reflect red at night Standing in the middle of the river was a big huge hairy ape looking thing I later told my father of this experience and asked his opinion of the possibility that this was a sleep sight for a Bigfoot The red eyes on this thing glowed off the security-light at the top of the cliff and I was just scared shitless From that day I vowed to become a researcher in the bigfoot world and my goal is to get enough proof of this creature so it can be recognized to mainstream science and documented so we can protect this creature and its habitat. She said she saw a black 6 1/2 to 7 foot creature observing us The eyes were emitting from what appeared to be two ""cougar-type"" felines Upon examination, we realized these were very large barefoot human like tracks During the whole incident the thought of the possibility of Bigfoot crossed my mind, but I didn't let it stay long My friend grabbed his 22 rifle and we went out the back door in time to see it step NOT JUMP but step over a 3 strand barb wire fence and run in a hunched over motion with it's arms swinging it's hands below it's knees I know one thing for sure,me and my brother were without a doubt approached by a very surprised ohio bigfoot I mused that it may have been a Bigfoot and forgot about the incident As we proceeded back towards our house, I turned around and I could see six to seven foot tall upright walking animal covered with very thick hair approaching us at a very rapid pace There was a flash of something that went by my window, she screamed, I told her to drive it was just my cup falling off the roof...yes, the same cup I secured between my legs Sometimes to the point that my hair would stand on end She couldn't estimate the height but believed it was six to seven foot tall I opened my pack, yanked out my audio recorder, dropped it on the ground, had to reinstall the batteries, set my pack on the ground, and headed off after the creature it was not dark yet . I jumped from the tree and ran back to my house with tears in my eyes We had plenty of footage to rummage through It stood between seven feet and eight feet in height, slim built.The time of day was around 1630 hours, cloudy, the temp It entered into the peripheral of our headlights and came within 2-3 feet of the driver side window is easier if you know what’s being eaten, I examined the stool with a stick to find hair, bone fragments, shells from crayfish, and maybe eggs of some sort Ron turned and looked Scott in the eyes and said ""yes"" tall, said the objet was just as tall as he was, at least I saw a bigfoot in 1995, in the evening, at around 9 p.m., running  The same roud that runs north and south of the sight were my father seen the footprint I was totally terrified 57 and saw a large very tall figure, completely covered in brown striding across a small clearing between patches of woods My uncle was walking and found a thick clump of black hair on the ground and within just flash was gone.I did stop the following day to see if I could see any kinda of tracks and saw nothing but the composition of the ground would probably not yeild a good footprint next to the road as for the marshy area I didnt venture in..Very strange indeed. As it ran I noticed it had a slight bend in the knees with long arms slightly swinging for the last 2 and a half years ive been completely engulfed in the bigfoot researchers association The building was at least six feet tall and Jim said it was leaning on it with his elbow! After hearing this, my dad opened the front door, jumped over the porch, and ran to our dog, untied him and they ran out back  At 8 foot high on the tree trunk was this snap break It looked at me with big brown eyes EVEN THO I CARE NOT TO SEE ONE AGAIN I THINK THEY SHOULD BE PROTECTED FROM THE PLUBLIC.MOST OF THE FOLKS WHO LIVE NEAR THE WOOD LINE HAVE HAD A ENCOUNTER WITH OUR HAIRY FRIENDS Drifting silently, straining eyes and ears for any sign of intruders, we quietly paddled into the marina and made our way past the floating docks to Mr It seemed quite large but i didnt realize how big until about a half hour later, another person showed up and started riding their bycicle around the lake,it had a track, it was about a mile around,but i waited for the byciclist to get to the spot where the:thing"" got out of the water, and it was as tall as a man on a bike  We estimate that this thing was close to eight feet tall and over 500 pounds in size  I truly believe that it was a bigfoot He looked back to the yard and said, ""Look..there it is."" I looked in the direction he was pointing and there was this huge hairy thing walking out of the woods with the moonlight on its back I decided to walk the road home instead of cutting through the ""dark scary"" woods I knew they saw something because I could see in there eyes how scared they were. I happened to look down at the ground with my Nitelite, and low and behold, there they were - two (2) huge foot prints A Bigfoot.""  He said it looked about 7 ft tall and big, standing on two feet like a man, but looked fur covered as much as they could make out in the dark One thing I do remember is that when it turned and walked away that the hair on it's hind quarters was thinner and that it's butt was visible During the previous winter, I had grown to over six feet in height, my weight had increased to almost 190 pounds and, even if I was still learning how to keep all of that mass under control, I realized for the first time that I was some inches taller and very nearly as strong as Mr She went to the living room and sat in the dark until it got light outside Thats when I realized this bigfoot is still out here Just after that fence was a drop off of about 2 feet One day in the late afternoon my sister and I climbed on my motorcycle and headed back to what was once strip mines.I frequently rode there and knew every bit of it.We had just rounded a corner and were headed north when we noticed South of us 2 ""people"".I immediately assumed it was my one friends with his dad..They are big guys.Well,I turned the bike around and headed toward them.At this point, they were quite a distance away.As we got closer,a strange transformation took place in my mind.What had been my friend took on a different appearance altogether.I remember feeling strange because my previous thoughts were being replaced as we got closer.At some point, we realized it was not my friend, and within seconds after that,saw them enough to get the details.They were indeed large,covered with hair,and looked human.They were not bears for 2 reasons.Their faces,and the way they left, on 2 legs.When years later I saw the Patterson film,the first thing that struck me was the way that animal looked at the camera.When these 2 beings looked at us,they also turned their upper body with their head to see us.As soon as I realized that we were looking at 2 huge, 2 legged things looking at us,I immediately got scared.Right after they looked at us,they were gone into the woods.We coasted up to the spot,and my sister reached up and turned off the bike.I protested! In the distance we heard distinctly branched breaking as if something snapped them as it ran.I also remember thinking that the snapping sound was deeper,as if whatever was breaking was larger than the typical twig.We re-started the bike and ran for home.It wasnt until later that we even thought about Bigfoot.But i must stress,we saw them in the day,and we saw them close enough to know what we saw. I'm sure Bigfoot doesn't have the same synchronized Swiss Army watch strapped to his or her own wrist At one point it sounded like it was 20 feet from me!! I finally made it to my backyard and whatever it was never came out of the woodline to show itself to me What I was looking at was a tall hairy creature of some sort that had very wide shoulders and glowing green eyes Looked about seven foot tall. Our trail cam took a picture of something with long hair  We wore our boots to keep our feet dry I peered through the binoculars and saw flowing fox colored hair on a hand touching the plaster of paris in the footprint I'm not spooked when I hear a new sound in the woods and I don't get the ""willies"" in the darkness of the woods very easily It looked at me and his face appeared to be human! This thing was big!! dark hair covered the body but with a human face  The color of the eyes were blue,and the pupils were fully open and i could see the whites of the circumference.then the eyes disappeard It was getting darker and my imagination started making me nervous, especially since the dog kept looking back in the direction we had come This thing had the speed of an animal and it held its forearms up high kind of reminds me of the memorial day footage Maybe someone else has felt the same, or else I am totally nuts? I am particularly interested in why I felt this and a very dark night  My voice was trembling a bit because I’ve read the other stories on this website about sasquaches living in the area, especially the one pertaining to the bigfoot standing along the entrance road to the park being only about two miles from our little property below the lake The distance between the prints was roughly 6 1/2 feet From my office window I kept my eyes on a circular patch of light coming from a light perched atop a pole closest to the sound, fully expecting to see a Sasquatch stepping from the woods into the light, but that never happened Well I didn't find any bigfoot feet prints but then I didn't find any  sign of deer or bear activity either  When she crossed the bridge, the same bridge that crosses the tracks that run down these woods, she said that she saw this very large man lookinmg hairy thing walking down the railroad tracks I was hunting in southwest Ohio not thinking I would encouter a big foot its 700 acres of public hunting hardwoods with pine trees in the middle Just sitting on the patio with my husband talking and I looked out toward the woods behind our home and in the blink of an eye a tall black creature walking on two legs took 2 large steps past our shelter and barn and was gone Although we did not get a visual, we fully believe this creature is large, athletic and completely in its element in the woods at dark. Then my cousins and I were out on the deer stand by the field and I looked toward the West and saw this tall reddish brown beast with black deep set eyes A dense fog had appeared over the higher field flowers and tall grass behind our camp site This footprint was 16-18 inches long at least 4 inches at the heel and 8 inches or more at the toes Then a tall figure approached the window of the trailer  He saw a dark, hairy, figure run out from behind a tree I just seen the immense size of it and it looked like it had very coarse looking hair (Investigators note: It took me almost 9 steps to cross the road at the same location) Report published in the December, 1998 issue of the Monthly Bigfoot Report. He estimated the tracks were at least 15 inches long with huge strides even going up the hillside As my lights hit it as with out thinking it turned back the way it had come very swiftly, but another interesting thing that i noticed was as it tuned to go back into the swampy area I could plainly see the entire bottom of its foot wich was very  very large and light in contrast to the rest of the creature and void of any fur/coat would very much put you in the mind of a humans foot only much much larger  It had to have stood 8 to 9 feet tall This one particular day, my father and I awoke early in the morning to leave for Fremont, it was barely light out, still dark  Just as I came over the small bridge over the drainage ditch headed south toward the RR tracks, I saw a tall (about 7-8ft), large fur covered biped, standing about 15 ft east of the roadway near the tree line as if waiting to cross the street after we passed Due to it being dark the witnesses could not see who was throwing things at them Half way across the yard I heard brush, breaking when I looked over,we saw a large hairy creature very tall staring at us He was noticeably hairy and had very long arms, like down to his knees We spotted a foot print actually my boyfriend did Suddenly I heard the sound of footsteps walking through water The witnesses were unfamiliar with the term ""Bigfoot"", until the press caught wind of the story We have made this a positive thing for him saying ""How many people actually see a bigfoot! What a cool kid you are!"" Plus allowing him to express how he has been feeling about this whole thing  There was two very clear footprints in clay and a lot more less recognizable in the hard soil I had never been a believer in Bigfoot, but the thing I saw was something I cannot to this day explain All I remember was saying to myself ""oh my God it was on 2 legs."" It took only 3 jumps to cross 20 feet.It was starting to get dark and was about 50 feet from me, so I couldn't tell the color or features It was very fast and it had black hair all over We could make out only the outline, but it was at least seven foot tall and very massive As I turned down this road, looking straight ahead down this private lane, I saw big eyes looking back at me so we kept hiking hoping to see him, and as we were hiking i would here deep sounding grunts and out of the corner of my eye would see big dark figures moving The hair was black and partially growing down the fingers We finally got to the end of the tree line and it meets a large field with tall grass that gets five to six feet high and part of it seems to be swampy and has some cat tails growing on the one side My mother seen three sets of these eyes, and also heard the screaming, she was a born and raised country girl, so she knows what sounds are what in the country I observed a seven to eight foot tall creature standing not more than 10 feet away from me as I shined the light up I seen red eyes  We looked at each other and started to cross the creek, which was about 12' wide at the point we were at, when we both saw a large, human foot print in a sand bar that was in the middle of the creek  My wife described the eyes as very close together and a glowing green color and larger than a humans eyes Then, the party saw what looked like a large bipedal hairy creature step in front of the large cats as if to protect them He swears that he NEVER heard me scream run and he never heard us screaming and running to the car.He said that it was about as tall as his sister who is ten  The eyes stayed fixed on me at that point, blinking – sometimes both eyes at once, sometimes one eye then quickly the other When I close my eyes and imagine that night 11 years ago, the hair still stands on my back To the left, about 20 feet was a small pool formed in the rock and fed by a trickling waterfall I saw a set of large eyes staring at me with a dark shaped face To be honest just writing about this makes the hair on my neck stand up even after all these years.  The hair on my body stood straight up and without looking back I turned and ran as fast as I could  When it did that, the shorter eyes all started to move, appearing and disappearing and moving around in a smooth and floating manner At that point, I felt fairly sure that they were from a bigfoot My brother was so stunned he froze in his chair My mind said this is what they call a Bigfoot Upon driving through area the next day, I noticed a 5-6 foot ditch on the south side of the road and figured out that's why it had to be sprinting so fast so it could jump over the embankment.   The second one was the same color, grayish brown, hairy, straight hair but obviously fur rather than human hair, more coarse looking About two weeks ago, my mother told me to look at some footprints outside, I did not get a chance until today (May 26, 2002), the first thing we seen when going outside was our bird feeder had been bent all the way over, as to if something had pulled it down to get the birdseed So many people tell me they don't believe in it because no one has ever found a dead Bigfoot in the forest As we returned to the house up the muddy tractor path I looked down to avoid a mud puddle, and I saw a footprint Seemed to be between 7 and 7 1/2 feet tall We followed the footprints and they had stopped and looked as if they squatted down  We call it home now since 1999 and never want to leave, even if there is a bigfoot nearby! Although I have to admit, this whole thing kind of freaks me out and I don't want to be scared of my surroundings we have been into the whole bigfoot thing and decided that we would go hike and hopefully see him My sister, friend, cousins and I were walking and found a dead deer like described in the ""Deer kills and Bigfoot"" article, stomach the same and everything I taking pictures of deer carcass and the bigfoot prints near the deer when I noticed the lower portions of the deer legs stacked together against a large tree I asked her, ""Did you see that?"" I told her that I saw a figure run across the road and I could see its legs About 50 or so feet to the left of them was what appeared to be an albino something, and it must have been sitting or lying down at time Then this morning I ran across A.D.'s report and thought, ""Ah-ha! So I am not the only person who has wondered about these cries."" After giving thought to the possibility that the cry is that of Bigfoot, it crossed my mind that rather than a cry of physical pain it might be instead a cry of emotional pain, the cry of a lonely being hoping to hear an answering cry All dark hair looks black at night, and all hair has many colors that people don't immediately see without observation We stepped aside to let some fellow hikers walk through and I happened to notice on the other side of the trail (off the trail) an almost perfectly shaped large footprint  With us pondering we saw what seemed to be cat eyes staring right back at us I turned around to look back towards my truck and next to the gas well road was a large tree that was about 30 feet off the road We yelled that Bigfoot was out there again and of course Dad told us to go back to bed and quit fooling around, it was past our bed time  The figure was slightly taller than the fence and broad bodied The only description that comes to mind is the howl done by the lady on Bigfoot Hunter, the name escapes me at the moment It was just about dark by now and I thought I saw something move in the trees on the outside of our property This unexplained creature appeared to be at least seven and a half foot tall and had to weigh a minimum of six hundred pounds There is a group of three small trees that we have converted to a counter and about 6-7 feet on the other side was a Pewter or dark gray ""thing"" Whatever that critter was, he was not human and I'm not even certain that he was a he! The trashcan, a recycled 55 gallon drum lying on its side near his feet, must have been the best part of three feet in diameter, but it didn't come up even as high as his knee and my best guess is that he stood at least eight feet tall! The light of the mercury lamp behind him made a kind of halo around him and I could see that he was covered all over in two-to-three inch hair with the longer hair of his head hanging down past his shoulders so that it shadowed his face and hid the contours of his neck Driving  east on SR 32 in Pike County Ohio noticed a dark figure on the white center line of a four lane highway This activity continued until it was about 20 feet from the woodline I would also just like to add that later this past week myself, my friend, and some college friends took a walk down into the woods in the middle of the night where we discovered and photographed three large footprints coming up out of the river bed.  I was in total shock that night when I saw something really tall with long straight hair all over, dark rusty brown, and had a long stride as it crossed the road  Being an outdoor person all my life as well as an experienced hunter, I know for a fact that whatever was coming towards us was bipedal and wanted us out of there  I grew extremely scared by bigfoots size and strength and what it might do to me if it saw me Ok, I was zipped and ready to move and slowly backing towards the car, eyes fixed on the direction of the sound In summary, I have watched enough Bigfoot TV shows, read enough about them to feel comfortable with what I have heard and seen  As we got to the end of the woods my friend stepped on an apple thorn which went through his boot and into his foot Those wheels were as high as my head an I’m over 6’2” tall I cannot totally remember the arms but they may have been swinging as it walked We arrived just before sunset, explained to the owner of the bait shop what we intended to do, and, before full dark set in, made a quick tour of the marina; noticing the damage done to a number of the boats docked there  My wife later told me that she saw arms swaying  Later at lunch, the boy said something very big ran westward very fast between him and the creek, about 30 yds away in the dark, and turned north-west up the western edge of the field then stopped about 50 yds away from him, waited a few minutes, then continued on NW at a walk towards Donnels Creek and the fields beyond I will tell you this I was about 10 feet away and already walked right by it before it took off running The figure landed facing us on 2 feet and was very obvious it was like nothing we had ever seen before I went to take a leak on the port potty we had set up 100 feet from the campsite WE HAD HEARD OF SIGHTINGS OF BIG FOOT IN THE AREA JUST A FEW DAYS EARLIER It appeared to be a fresh break and considering it was so close to the footprint we thought it was odd.  Then we saw these marks on the ground by the tree.they were 7 feet apart markings on the ground As it walked across the bridge, its head was at least 2 feet above the rail which was at least 6 foot high And I said bigfoot I climbed up and there it was a foot print My friends mother in law asked why were down by the rabbit pens and we told her we had found a footprint and we filled it with plaster It maintained the same shape standing tall and continued snapping and twisting the branches without making any other noise They saw several large footprints with narrow heels and wide toes I never thought about this as anything until 1992, when one of my students referred to bigfoot sightings in that area. The cast indicated that the depth of the foot at the ball was two inches and the depth at the heel was one inch. It was dark against the fog  Not knowing about Bigfoot, I passed them up as a case of mistaken identity or just a practical joke It walked in very large strides and covered much of the clearing in a few seconds as I observed it while driving While looking into the darkness to our front, my Rear Guards came running past us, yelling, ""its charging us!"" and ran right by us into the woods It wasn’t until maybe 20 years later when I happened on a Bigfoot program showing such a structure that a bell went off as to what we’d saw I let out a holler  and it turned and walked away slowly in a large stride swinging its arms almost like a person but definitely was not It was a dark night and early morning, fall but warm weather so no coats needed The nails were long and blackened and the palm was hairless and appeared to be very callas About a mile or so up the road I noticed a very tall, hair covered creature walk across State Route 170 from east to west I started walking slowly into the opening and proceeded about 10 feet, turning my head slowly to the left and right  It was over 7 feet tall and weighted about 500 - 700 pounds from as far as I could tell I was in a hunting chair back in some thicket I went in the woods about 5:30 about 8:00 I fell asleep in the chair around 8:45 heard some noise I thought was a deer I waited for a minute didn't here anything so I stood up and something started knocking over trees screaming running away at first I thought I scared a deer but deer will take an open trail or thicket to get away this was knocking over 3 inch trees and growling The more and more I thought about it I felt that it couldnt have been a jogger for a few reasons, 1 it was 90F + and I couldnt imagine someone dreesed in such dark colors from head to toe, 2nd is the speed this thing had was not humanly possible, if I had blinked my eye I would have missed it, if I would have had a camera I would have missed it anyway because of the speed It was hard to get a good look at the face because of darkness and it being so close to the car With our backs to the puddle walking up the path, we heard a rushing rustle through the weeds and the sound of bare feet slapping wet muddy ground within just a few feet of us The window is about 6 feet off the ground so I guess it was roughly 7 feet tall I turned to look up the bank (Smokey had ceased growling and was leaning against me)and saw something I had never seen before until many years later in a documentary on 'Big Foot' I noticed that its arms looked extremely long and made the creature look kinda ape-like in that respect It appeared to be brownish and very hairy AS I WENT TO LET THE OTHER DOG GO I NOTICE A SHADOW JUST FOUR FEET AWAY FROM ME  There stood this enormous hairy figure looking down at us from about 25 yards away  As my friend and I checked out this strange thing, we both heard the sound of heavy foot falls coming towards us Ground was padded with dog prints in about a 50 foot circle I watched it walk about 50 or 60 feet I saw a tall dark figure walking with very long strides I then looked around where she was and I saw a footprint  Both witness's said they could see its left arm swinging as it walked and it took only 2 1/2 steps to cross the road She said it was dark in color while he thought it more closer to be dark brown There was about 10-12"" of standing water in the tunnel all the time and it was very dark inside I proceeded to go into the house and opened the front door to listen, as the front door is closer to the woods and, I'm guessing, about 250 - 300 feet from where the sound was emanating from just within the treeline, I guessed She saw a gray over 7 foot creature after hearing a twig snap Dark hair color most likely black or a very dark brown In 2019 Richfield Ohio large dark figure crossed road. I have not told anyone and never reported it, but when I was younger I believed in Bigfoot, but now I am 26 and was very skeptical the last few years knowing that this thing if it existed would need hundreds of square miles of remote area to be out of sight of people and I did not think anything in Ohio could accomadate that i went to feed the dogs at about 1100 pm an something was coming towards me threw the corn field i thought it was a deer it stopped about 75 feet from me and stood erect it was aclear night and the corn had a bright haze over it i could see it very clearly i turned and ran into the house the next day i went into the cornto look for foot prints but the soil was very dry there were scuff marks and some ears of corn were missing it went straight back the way it came the corn was 6 feet high it cleared the corn by 2 feet it had squared shoulders and no neck shoulders were about 36 inches wide My wife Amy had decided to walk back to our van for another chair and I decided to go with her because the trail was a bit winding through the woods I was driving my car up a hill at about 60mph when up ahead at the top I saw what I thought was a man carrying a bundle of sticks (about eight feet tall overall) across the road As we hiked the tracks, we got to a clearing that has a marsh/swamp to the west between the tracks and the road and tall weeds/brush/trees to the east a bigfoot came to the back of my mobile home and stood outside my screen window.....stayed there for 1 - 2 minutes - cavernous breathing,  most terrifying , petrifying moment of my life  ....long story,   I'm at work now,   at the time called the University of Pennsylvania who referred me to Grover Krantz at the University of Washington State....He received a detailed report and was plotting sightings in the area..... My experience with Bigfoot occured when I was about ten years old during the fall of 1977  He described it as at least seven foot tall, huge torso, big muscular arms down to its knees and head set on shoulders with no neck and reddish eyes  In other words, kind of like when in a marching band the people on the outside fringe of a circular-moving formation have to march at double- or triple-time to keep up with the people who are barely shuffling their feet at the center of the circle, the creature was moving so fast that my dog still had to run full-out to keep up with it  We've heard many stories of Bigfoot sitings over the years, with increased regularity The other thing I noticed was its hair coloring looked dirtier below the waist. We both know that whatever this thing was, it ran on two legs, had brown shaggy hair, and was extremely large in size  I told the kids and they believed me because they felt the hair on there necks stand up like I had I was staring into the eyes of a creature like I had never seen before Afterwards, while thinking about what happened, I said something to my girlfriend about how strange the sounds were, and that maybe it was Bigfoot I kept looking into the trees, but it was much too shadowy and dark to make anything out Its height was around 6 1/2 feet tall with a build similar to a human frame  Justin said that as they approached the eyes they stood above the corn  I was kidding and said, ""Is it bigfoot?"" And he said very seriously, ""yeah, I think it was.""  I ran out the back door which is toward the opposite side of the garage than where whatever it was would be standing  His Dad got a deer on the southeast corner of the field within 1 hour of the opener that morning, turned out in the dark and wet, he sat down amongst a small deer herd (about 8 deer) bedded there I have two things to report: 1) I think I saw a bigfoot 2) A few weeks later, I think I heard it Where do you start making a report about this?  All I can say is that after what I saw and heard, I have to support the other person that made a report because I have to back them up I would be happy to send you a copy of a colored picture I drew when I was 5 years old back in 1943 of what possibly could have been a bigfoot I could not believe it! I used a carpenters square and to reference the size and took digital pictures of the foot prints in the snow It walked in big strides unlike any animal known to me The creature looked as though it would stand, eight to nine feet tall and at weighed at least 300 pounds if not more The thing that made me think this was strange was the distance between the eyes Then another hoot farther to the right as we could hear the footsteps fade in the distance It was about seven feet tall, and it had rather long, dirty, reddish brown hair The description of white eyes seemed odd, so I questioned him very carefully on this matter, but he stuck to his story All we could see was a silhouette, but it was definitly upright on two legs, swinging its arms and a massive torso as it was running through the water and  I got up and headed out to the rear deck totally dismissing what I had encountered the previous night  I’d say my dog ran about thirty or forty feet to my left in about four seconds, which means that the creature ran about 100 to 150 feet in that time   I drove forward to where I saw whatever it was cross the road, (arms / front legs in the air, big body lower, leaping into the woods), and didn't see anything after that When we got down there she said wow bigfoot XXXXXX never saw the eyes He didn't see the eyes but that could have been because of bangs hanging over them It was 8 or 9 feet tall and covered with a reddish brown fur While taking a break during a hike back from the Lou Wetzel cabin, we were sitting at a picnic area just below the Clark cabin when we seen a creature walking upright on it's hind legs with long brown hair and piercing green eyes It was a moonlit night so I could see that is was very large and hairy In a later sweep of the area we found a cardboard sign on a fence that read: BIGFOOT DRINKS BEER HERE  Maybe six foot ten to seven feet tall What impressed us more than anything was the stride between the tracks  The eyes didn’t move for several seconds Now, I’m about 6’ 1” and this black thing was a good 8 feet in height or taller I walked down to where the creature was and noticed a footprint Far and away the scariest part of all this..when we were in the car and heard the first thump, I turned in my seat and looked in the direction of that thump, that meant I looked out that little window...I must have looked it straight in the eyes We took a few photos of the deer then decided to leave because it was getting dark It's arms were swaying back and forth and I remember the hair hanging from its arms I am now 6 foot 2 and 300 pounds, this thing was at least 8 foot tall and between 350 pounds and 450 pounds It had dark colored fur/hair, dark brown or black in color I have been casually interested in Bigfoot sightings over the years so am familiar with the sounds and circumstances of encounters. About a week before the actual sighting in the area they were frequenting, they noticed 3 or 4 very large five toed human like footprints in the soft soil going up the hillside Out of the corner of my eyes I detected a slight movement on the road but everything was bathed in shadow from the trees  I don't remember much moon-light because it was very dark outside the glow of the small porch light IT STOOD ABOUT 8 FT TALL AND VERY WIDE I asked the other couple if they believed in Bigfoot and my friend said he thought they might exist He was sitting in his home with his infant son shortly after dark when his Doberman began to bark and whine When I turned my eyes back on the subject, I noticed it turning  They could see it from the neck down and estimated it was no more than 150 feet away It was white in color, had dark brown skin, an apparent round head, and real deep sunk eyes It was completly covered with brown fur or hair even the face had hair on it.Its eyes he couldn't see until it was closer and then he said they were round and black I am not sure if it's because we were all deep down still recuperating from our last Bigfoot adventure, or if we just were too laid back into our boring small town lives once again The Bigfoot was probably about 30 feet away from us I got the key and stood back to see what looked like my dad who is a big man wearing his carhart coveralls, coat, stalking hat and gloves walking out into the yard about 35 feet away We finally made it through the field to the tree line and there was a small creek about three foot wide with very little water flowing through it and we also noticed a trail where the deer had been crossing that creek in that same area and it was heavily traveled because the tree roots were showing Seconds later, I saw eyes just off the road reflecting from my headlights and I thought it would be a deer so I slowed down to a crawl so I would not hit it if it decided to cross the road I had heard of bigfoot before and seen pictures on TV but had never seen one before I observed the creature to be about 4 to 5 feet tall Then this morning about 3 AM my mom was in the kitchen making coffee and looked out the large window on the side of the house and saw yellow eyes looking in at her It was covered with medium length brown hair all over its' body except its face  As I turned from Rt 5 to Newton Falls Road, my headlights swept across the fence line, my eyes caught the figure Then I knew what I was looking at on the ridge it was two bigfoots and they were black and huge We walked the deer trail which followed the narrow creek and had noticed the narrow creek tees into a larger creek that was about 15 foot wide but we didn’t see a good spot to cross until we followed it a little farther and we had found a shallow spot that we could cross The only way I can guess its height was buy looking at the pine trees he was standing near and I would say this creature had to be about upper 6 foot, maybe close to 7  It seemed to be facing away from me I didn't see face but I could see a head and arms but it really wasn't moving Because it was dark out and we were driving 55 MPH, in the snap of a finger it was gone The tree was around 15 feet tall and the creature was approx It had watery looking black eyes It appeared to be from 4-5 feet at the back and torso built like a barrel It landed a few feet away from us just inside the tree line It was at about this time that I remembered a story on a website dedicated to Bigfoot about the possibility of these creatures communicating by making loud noises, such as rapping logs against trees  I first thought she was joking, but she wasn't, I got up and went to the window, which was closed, as it was cold, and opened the window and could not here anything or see anything, but it was dark from us we saw a huge hairy creature standing in a bipedal fashion with a forward gate staring in our direction  We turned only once after hearing a loud crack of wood, possibly a branch or something underfoot, to see this creature running almost noiselessly in the opposite direction It was completely dark outside by this time His eyes the size of quarters  I believe in Bigfoot and believe that they are descendants of cavemen that have never evolved. They were about a foot apart and shined green when the light hit them The trail area was about 100 to 150 yds ahead of me when from the right side of the road I seen a dark figure come out onto the road with such speed that their was no way it could have stopped to look for cars before crossing, this thing was dark brown or black from head to toe I would have to say it was three and a half to four feet wide, which made its waist look thin in comparison THERE HAS BEEN ONLY TWO CASES WERE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN IN A SIMULATED ATTACKED OR CHASED INTO THEIR HOME WITHOUT BEING HARMED OR KILLED BY ONE OF THE BIGFOOT CREATURES.THERE HAVE BEEN LOTS OF UNEXPLAINED SCREAMS, SIX INCH TREES SNAPPED IN TWO, ONE WITNESS HAS SEEN THEM ATTACK A  DEAR AND LEAVE NOTHING BUT THE RIBS .IF THEY COULD DO THAT TO A DEAR, THINK OF WHAT THEY COULD DO TO US.I HAVE LOST TWO DOGS THAT LOOKED TO HAVE BEEN STRANGLED OR UNEXPLAINED DEATHS.I DONT KNOW IF THEY WILL TALK OR NOT.I WILL. Looking at the log it was standing behind I'd say it was 7-8 feet shortly after that there was a strange smell of musty earth then i saw it (bigfoot) come walking out of the corn field.i would have to say it was about 7 to 8 ft tall long shaggy hair it looked like a over sized man with hair  I never mentioned the word Bigfoot to my girlfriend in fear of ridicule Whatever it was stood right up in front of the lens, so you can't see a body shot, but the picture shows brownish-reddish hair hanging down in front of the camera When I did that, he knew that if nothing else, at least I thought that I had seen bigfoot It was of a left foot I observed a dark-colored figure in the middle of the field, the top of the head, was dark gray and black, long dark hair I tried to follow the noise but it was gone in seconds so I headed back to my truck on my way back a buddy I was hunting with said he found a very big foot print it was in a foot of grass but one print pushed the grass down to the mud and you can see the print he was tracking a deer and found the print. I was squirrel hunting and walked right past bigfoot In this rocky area was a raised area about 8 feet higher than the surrounding area and resting on this solid rock ledge rested a wagon with broken wood spoke wheels (very old, very heavy construction) and a yoke for oxen with old leather straps and tack I didnt believe in Bigfoot until tonite I live in london ohio and this sighting took place about 50 miles from were I live due west in a wooded area that has a pond with enormous catails at the far side away from the road at approx 50 to 75 yds.I was driving at or around 35 mph going to church in august of 2004 at around 9;45 am on a sunday morning and as my 13 year old daughter and I were quiet and each just looking out our door windows in my chevy 4x4 when all the sudden to my left standing behind the catails was what I thought was a man in a dark chestnut fur coat I could only see from the waist up and its shoulders were enormous never paid much attention to the face it was to far away but those shoulders were huge so I told  rachel aint it a little hot for a fur coat then it struck me what that thing was.A few weeks later I drove this other road indicot that corners it and mad river lies about a mile behind it.  I can tell you that whenever my dog would be outside with me, about 85% of the time I observed him to be staring at that location 15 feet to the left of our driveway When I went back later after work is when we found a foot print. Through the years I have had several sightings and interactions with what appears to be a bigfoot and family I too thought it was a tree, but as I looked at it closer I could see hair moving in the slight breeze along it's side and head tall The last thing I thought was odd, in addition to the loudness of the vocalizations at a distance of 250-300 feet, was how - if it was a dog - the dog never, in 75 minutes, came towards a house to seek help from a human  I grabbed the flashlight and panned left to right,  As I got almost directly out in front of me about 60 feet out in the woods I came across a pair of eyes eight feet off of the ground About 300 feet away to my left I noticed this huge hair covered creature coming up the hill towards the cornfield  You could literally hear twigs and branches snap as each foot hit the ground I could plainly see the creature’s eyes and face  When we heard this sound all of my hair stood up on the back of my kneck  Only me and my friend know it to be true from witnessing the creature with our own eyes The hair/fur didn't cover the whole hand, just the top to just over the knuckles and back to the wrist As i started to get closer, maybe 3 feet away, I heard something big shuffling in the briers  Since then, a three to four feet section of our firewood that is stacked around the fire pit was pushed inward We were standing side by side and out of my peripheral vision I noticed some movement out of the corner of my left eye at the edge of the tree line that was approximately two hundred feet from where we were standing I was simply driving east on route 90, I had just passed the Lake County/Ashtabula County border and I was looking around as I usually do and I look over at this woodline hoping to see some deer or turkey and to my surprise there was what looked to be a Bigfoot walking through the woods about 100 yards from the roadway We heard this noise, that made your hair stand on end when we heard a blood curlting scream come from my sister outside, we all bolted to the front door where we met her shaking and breathing really hard which rattled me because my sister doesnt run from anything and is tough as nails anyway this is what she saw.she was standing in front of her car 5ft from the 12ft rag weeds when the weeds started folding over from left to right with a very large black hair covered animal in the middle full tilt coming straight at her at an alarming speed she said it was hunched over running on 2 legs but bounding the weeds over with its huge arms she said when it was bent over with hands close to the ground it was still way taller than her It had hair on its face the same color and a broad forehead The back was covered in hair, the arms hung down, it had very broad shoulders, the body was covered in brown hair She has told me that she has found large human-like footprints on her property several times over the past few years To the right of me I saw a flash of glowing eyes in my headlights In 1998 I was told about bigfoot being spotted in Woodbury gameland  Prints were found in the open field, where the larger prints joined up with the smaller foot prints, then the prints traveled togather I came around a curve and saw a reflection off the eyes of a deer They studied alleged prints and hair, but came up with no monster I then stomped my foot on the ground and snorted like a deer ( a sort of warning sound they emit when spooked) While waiting for the deputies, the bipedal creature appeared at the kitchen window - about four yards from the kitchen table Then, it moved left to right and appeared to be just above the grass line which was roughly about four foot high  We found an opening up there on the opposite side that was 8 feet high and 5 feet wide going into those woods i walked out of my mothers farm house i heard a deep howling sound coming from down by the calf penI returned to inside the house and explained to my mother that i heard the same noice decribed to me by my mothers boyfriend a few weeks earlier that he had heard then i left it was foggy out i was going down the hill right beside my mothers house i thought it was a telephone pole on the right side of the road it took off in front of my jeepit was brown and larger than i am and im six foot three inches and 240 lbs it ran across the road in 3 or 4 large steps it was very hairy and dark brownit didnt even look at me it just ran  on 2 legs i also heard the whilstles sound last year coon hunting and thought it was a bird till i heard the exact same sound on a recording on the internet It was strong and tall but not real tall It was walking upright like a man but I could tell it was covered with dark hair that was either dark brown or black in color I was not a Bigfoot enthusiast by nature There was something tall and very dark that was hard to make out It was approximately 8' tall, with hair covering its body now i believe in bigfoot/sasquatch so i would say it was bigfoot  Then the tree was pulled down to within a foot of the ground I looked down and saw what appeared to be a large footprint that was human in appearance  All of a sudden, from the right side of the road a very large hair covered animal walked across the road in plain view of there headlights All he could see was two red glowing eyes.  Just eyes We had been hearing strange noises, like some animal grunting or snorting for about 15 minutes when we noticed a 10-12 foot tall hairy creature walking upright along a tree line at the edge of a corn field  The height was undiscernable, but had to be above six feet tall tall and weighed somewhere around 500 pounds He proceeded to tell my father there were some very large footprints in the snow around his garage  I did not really believe in Bigfoot but now we are having second thoughts As I took my first step onto the path I saw a massive black object/thing at the bottom of the cliff in a wall of weeds taller than me JUST HAPPY TO GET LOOSE.MIND YOU, IT WAS DARK OUT BUT YOU COULD STILL MAKE OUT THINGS FROM THE LIGHTS FROM THE OUT BUILDING 50 YARDS AWAY.MY DOGS WERE TIED UP NEAR THE WOOD LINE AND THERE IS A STEEP VALLEY JUST BEHIND THE WOOD LINE, AND A THREE HUNDRED ACRE  FOREST SOUTH OF ME.THERE IS ALSO A PARK AREA WEST OF HERE I must admit a history of being very interested in Bigfoot as a whole, but never have I experienced something like this It was just starting to get dark out when I heard something moving about 200 yds I located sounds on the internet of alleged Bigfoot that were eerily similar to the sounds I heard on August 14, 2021. To our disappointment, the field had been no-tilled (Roundup) where the field was filled with weeds, grass, and corn stalks where it made it very hard to find footprints Several friends saw this, we went back out later that night, but were turned away by the Rangers, forest closed after dark  I didn't think to get a sample of the scat or look for footprints. She later asked us if it could have been Bigfoot The next morning I went out to investigate and discovered 9inch wide by 17 inch long bigfoot tracks About 10 to 15 seconds later we heard what sounded like someone or something jumping on the hood of a car and over the 8ft tall (give or take) junkyard fence, clipping it as it went over I gauged this by the height of an oak tree that the creature walked by (within 8-10 feet of) which my dad and I had  tranplanted there I was about 3 miles in the woods and something took off running and out of the corner of my eye I saw a big brown thing""bigfoot"" Well at first I thought it was a bear but a bear can't run on two feet, it can walk on two feet,but not run and this thing was running and had a stride The embankment was maybe 20 feet from me and covered sparsely with small trees and saplings It was very big, very tall, very wide Upon entering the woods, almost immediately about 60 yds in front of me was this white fuzzy thing standing on 2 legs looking directly at me I would best describe the creature's gait as a fast ""lope.""  What I mean is that it would bring its right leg to its left and repeat the same movement in a quick manner while swinging its arms in a fully extended and relaxed manner (kind of difficult to describe) I was wanting to know about the history of that specific area and also if there is any place where I can go to hear the sounds of Bigfoot Her son and nephew had a sighting of a Bigfoot a year ago ( Or sad as he put it) It had very long arms that hung passed his knees  and swung out very far in front and back as it walked.It was hunched over when it walked too Never breaking stride and not appearing to make any special effort, it sprang off that second step to the top of the embankment and disappeared into the thick brush that lined the roadway I cannot give an exact height measurement, but the creature appeared to be approximately 6 ft tall—This estimate is based upon our survey of the surrounding trees where the creature was sighted on the ridge  he described the animal as being fury and having a greyish light colored ""V"" shape of hair down its chest  There in the creek bottom was a footprint (This report was published in The Monthly Bigfoot Report, October 1998 edition) I am guessing it to be around seven feet or so because I looked up when I saw his eyes shining in the cool moonlight The face had a very heavy brow with deepest eyes, the nose was wide and flat with flared nostrils Well, I've really been into this Bigfoot stuff ever since I saw a show about it on the Discovery Channel a few years ago 6inch diameter hardwood trees broken over, briar brush flattened ending at the 5 foot tall barbed wire fence at the rear of my property crushed down to a foot high  There are a few houses and farms nearby but mostly it is just wooded and remote We stepped out of our vehicle using a large mag-light and we glassed the area where we saw the eyes and caught the eyes moving over the grass line Then, about 5 minutes later, we heard a tree fall to the right of us across the creek where we heard the footsteps and hoot sounds I spotted a manlike figure appearing totally black with one hand on a large tree limb Many more people in the area were having encounters but were unwilling to report it because of the ridicule the Caytons received, not to mention all the idiots running around ready to shoot anything with two legs and a pulse I estimated that the being would have stood eight to nine foot tall. I know of a friend who saw a bigfoot behind Boston Mills Ski Resort in the Cuyahoga National Recration Area in 1990 The gate of the tracks seemed to be about 8 to 9 feet apart. I really do know with out any doubt that bigfoot is real I stopped when I lit up a pair of eyes staring straight at me Unfortunately, I couldn't make out what it was, but it had chased me several feet before I got into the cabin The first thing that I noticed was the legs on the deer had been removed and the lower jaw was ripped off  It was dark, but I know it couldn't be human and it wasn't a bear, for it was more upright the hair or fur was only about 2 inches long. They were very large human-like footprints that came from a densely wooded area known as ""Goulds Hollow."" He said they came out of the woods, walked around the garage, and back into the woods in the same place it came out of.  He said that he looked at it for a minute and then said to himself, ""there shouldnt be anyone out here in bare feet"" I remember his eyes flashing red as the fire would reflect in them As we came around a corner to a long straight away, we saw a tall brownish hairy creature walking from a field going east to west crossing the road A local farmer and police officer contacted a researcher (Richard Hoffman) in Dayton, Ohio concerning two unusual foot- prints on his property He said, ""I just seen a Bigfoot."" He said that when he was looking at the creature the creature looked right back at him as if he was scared of my uncle and not sure of what my uncle (being in the tree) was  He also said that its feet made a lot of noise thumping on the ground as it ran This was seen at dusk our road is about2 miles long fairly secluded farms heavily wooded areas various ponds/streams I sat in a chair while I smoked and noticed it was getting dark quickly This break occured at 8 feet above the ground There is no doubt in my mind there is a big foot there in northern Ohio. It was upright and moving on two feet He said he thought when it stood up that it appeared to be between 7 and 8 feet tall seven feet tall and was all covered with long hair, except its face They observed it at a distance of about 100 feet About six feet from where I sat I saw this Yeti from the waist up only because there was a four foot drop-off where the winding path continued There were some footprints, but I am sure they were made by a guy from  a neigboring farm It was slender, tall and had fur hanging off of it, its arms swung down past its knees almost I went back to the house and brought down a tape measure to the footprint and measured it and took pictures with the tape measure beside it Ron said the effect on him was like someone had lit match at his feet and the heat travelled all the way to the top of his head In the process of returning the can to its proper position, I noticed a thick, two foot tall, steel post that had been driven into the ground next to the circle of bare earth where the can normally stood there were a couple of quarter-inch thick steel links welded to the post and two rusty pieces of metal welded to the last links in the chain Color seemed to be medium to dark gray It was way taller than the deer and was a light to medium brown It took two to three steps and leaped over these reeds that were at least 4 foot tall When she started heading down there she saw a very large six to seven foot tall animal on two legs  Maybe this is a route they use?? Thing was all black and had a long torso with very tall long arms that were swinging in a forward motion when it was running. When the light came on, it somewhat startled the creature as it turned around to look my way but did not break stride as it walked out of the light Then several more strides and it stopped again I heard the sounds of footsteps crunching in the frost as it moved to the other end of the pen and then heard the squeaking sound of the fence being pushed down Hello, about two years ago, I finally got the courage to tell a Bigfoot researcher in Ohio my story from many years ago The sounds sent all the hair on my arms and neck to stand up  The foot print was of a large barefoot, about 14"" - 16"" long and about 3"" - 4"" deep and maybe 7"" - 8"" wide at the base of the toes This report is discussed in depth in the November 1998 issue of my newsletter the Monthly Bigfoot Report, #75. The arms, shoulders and especially the legs were 2-3 times the size of any appendages that I'd ever seen, very muscular A large two legged something, thumped its way about twenty to thirty feet away through my camp Grunting non-committally, Mr Well, all of a sudden there was this loud, deafening scream-roar-growl noise And we heard what sounded like heavy footsteps in the field next to us I still can NOT believe what I'm pretty damn sure I saw! ...and that was EITHER a very tall man, wearing allot of winter gear with either a hooded coat or long hair and a beard that barely glanced in our direction as we drove by....or something else that I would rather not venture to guess upon! THIS IS NOT A JOKE!!!!! I HAVE NEVER SEEN OR DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE! I'm a 47 year old father of four  We reached our picnic area, picked up our belongings, and that's when we heard it again, this time thunderously loud, and we knew it had followed us and believe it was within about 50 feet of us still concealed in the woods My leg sighting does not match a bear leg because the hind leg of a bear or dog has an odd angle from the pad of the foot to its leg When my sister was taking her dog Aquilia outside for a walk the dog stopped, her ears went back, her hair stood up, and she ran back into the house What was weird is that I could tell it was there, but it seemed to blend into the woods, so it looked like a dark figure Yesterday up the road from my house a friend and I actually saw a bigfoot in the daylight about 6 pm Years later now, I am visiting your website and listening to sound clips of Bigfoot They estimated it to be about 300 pounds and 7 feet tall Comparing the creature to our truck, it had to have been nearly 8 feet tall, as it was slightly slouched while running and was a head taller than our truck Next to the tree was a very tall, wide shouldered, very built, dark brown, hairy creature standing next to it Although it was about my height (6 foot 2) it was very wide at the shoulders We had crossed the bridge back around 150 yards just east when we saw ahead of us a dark silhouette cross over the tracks going to the right The entire creature was covered in dark fur, not matted but not ""furry"" I could also very clearly see what I thought was more like ""footprints"" I said, What is that? My mom had to slow down to keep from hitting it and when we were about 15 to 20 feet away it got up on its hind legs like a man about 6'6"" to 7' tall and walked quickly off the road in to the night in 2 steps   My sister and I still remember the feeling of not being able to move, and to this day we still get cold chills and our eyes water every time we talk about this The Bigfoot was tall about 9-11 feet if I had to guess and it had broad shoulders and it was brownish grey in color His shoe size was fifteen and this barefoot was much larger  We tried to see the source of the foot falls but the foliage was so thick we couldn't see anything It was very dark and it blended right in with the darkness except the chest or stomach, not sure which, it happened so fast  I tried to look back through my mirrors but couldn't make out anything in the dark, even though there was a little moon-light. I saw a dark shadow and at first thought my eyes were playing tricks on me but when I looked again I saw the outline of a Large man, but covered with hair Given our encounters and physical evidence which we were able to document, we strongly feel there is one explanation Bigfoot  I sat there and observed it following the deer trail...knowing it was not a black bear walking on two legs  So, whatever walked across the creek had a stride of at least 6' to reach the sand bar and was tall enough simply step right out the creek and over a 5' bank on the other side It had very long arms, much longer than a human's I am about 95% sure that I shone my light into the eyes of a sasquatch that night – and a big one, too My mother was crying and holding my baby sister in her arms, and I asked my dad what was wrong and he said look out the window The windows are about two and a half feet wide and about one and a half feet tall We both said ""let's get the hell out of here."" As we jumped in the car, I, out of habit, grabbed the cup off the roof and placed it between my legs well at about 6:30 pm or so we started hiking and had seen footprints  I remember the impression was that we didn't believe it to be the OPFOR unit because of the noise in the trees above our heads and the sound of heavy footsteps coming at us Even though the hair was standing up on the back of our necks, we slowly walked over to where it crashed through the woods Neither one of my parents ever saw anything but still to this day say they believe we did see something, whether it was someone playing a joke or possibly a bear but I still think to this day that it was Bigfoot or something similar. We noticed its brown shaggy hair all over its body and its immense size from the time I was young I remember hearing people tell stories of bigfoot, occult activity, and all other kinds of nonsense stories  She took pictures on her phone with her feet next to them as reference This creature appeared to have a stride of nearly or about 5ft toe to toe  The eyes were the size of golf balls,further apart than humans When I got in the house I found my father asleep in his chair and realized what I must have just seen was the same thing that we saw crossing the road about a month before and was suddenly scared and after I thought about it our dog that was half wolf did not even get out of his doghouse to greet us when we got home and he would have been raising hell if a stranger was on the property  My wife and I were at dinner and as we arrived home about 8:30 PM a very large fast gray/ silver lite brown (covered in fur/hair) bigfoot darted from bushes in our front into the cat tails in our pond on all fours I would not be writing this If I hadn't got a book from the library about Ohio Bigfoot by Chris Murphy and seen a website for BFRO.net  Someone had left manufactured footprints underneath the covered bridge As we approached the intersection about 100 feet from the covered bridge, my friend said that he sees a set of eyes reflecting from the car lights on the left-hand side of the road Scott fell asleep on the way home, about 45 minutes from home Scott woke up and jokingly asked Ron if he saw Bigfoot today. I watched in disbelief as it covered about 50ft distance with what seemed like 5 or 6 strides and disappeared into the darkness  Just last week my younger son and I found footprints in the woods by a thicket too dense for us to walk into.  At 9:15pm out to the left of the over hang in the woods there was this loud crash that shook the ground beneeth our feet It is unlikely anybody would risk a cross country hike in the dark, and on that terrain, to spend a half hour in a remote location banging logs on trees just for the heck of it They saw two pairs of yellow eyes that seemed to be reflecting a porch light It seemed to be a younger one but just as tall I can tell you that it did not sound human and was totally creepy!  Up until that moment, there were no answers to previous calls  We waited till it got dark to see if anything came out  As we looked into the woods, we could hear it moving through the foliage not getting closer than 100 feet away I estimate the creature to have been about 8-9 feet tall As I crested the top, there it was, directly in front of me, and about 30-40 feet away So the fence itself was about 5 feet tall if you were coming over it from the other side I remember reddish (hair) appearance All I remember was that it was big and only on 2 legs I really don't think the bigfoots would permanently live or hang out in there. It was huge in size and running on two feet full steam ahead The whole thing was sparked because I had found an unusual barefoot track while out fishing with a friend I hope I am interesting you because I really believe ""bigfoot"" to be real ""Coons'll tear up a trashcan worse'n you'd believe."" He  replied, getting out of the car and signalling the end of our conversation by leaving me alone in the dark as he headed for his back door I could see the hair shimmer as it walked  I am an avid hunter and fisherman and have no trouble distinguishing camoflage from hair at the distance the subjet was from us, which was about two hundred yards A low growl and these foot steps that I swore I could ""feel""  By seeing my nephew and sister in the same spot where I saw the eyes, it was apparent that the adult creature was much taller than they are Once he started moving to the right, he looked back at the truck and said he could not see the eyes  She said it was furry but at the angle I was looking I was unable to make out anything except a very dark figure that “seemed” tall and was definitely walking on two legs  She said that it had to be atleast 8 feet tall and very hairy It seemed to be rather tall, but I didn't see any more than legs and body They saw a creature that was covered with dark matted hair Taking one step OVER the trashcan, it took a second stride to reach the embankment that flanked the western side of  the marina He must have heard something outside his window, maybe a sound they make or something in that nature? The first time I submitted photos, they asked about seeing red eyes  We did not see any other foot prints on the far bank, which is about 5' higher than the near bank As I was mowing, a dark figure appeared down by the corner of one of the fields, approximately150-200 yards out It was at least 7 ft tall, hairy, and fast....in a weird way  It was only six to eight feet away from me I kept the light trained on the eyes for about 30 secs slid his legs out of his sleeping bag and turned to sit up without making any more noise than my whisper, but even then, I saw the figure give a little start and begin to turn its head from side to side as if searching for the source of the sounds that I could barely hear I started up the bank a few seconds later and reached the top of the bank in time to see 'it' cross a six foot high gate leading into a field, without even touching it This instance also occurred on the same trail where my husband and I heard the howling/roaring and I saw the bipedal creature in Sept On October 22, 2010, I was driving home from work, it was approximately 8 pm at night, and I was driving on a country road out behind canton airport when my headlights hit something huge standing at the side of the road..my mind couldnt make sense of what it was, all I knew was the hair stood up on the back of my neck and I felt the need to get past this thing very fast..so I sped up..and it was just standing...right at the edge on the line at the side of the road towering...it wasnt moving..yet there was some sort of movement like the wind blowing something..I was so terrified that as soon as I got past it..I checked my rearview mirror and whatever it was was gone..the next morning in the light..I checked the whole area on my way past to work and there were no trees, as was suggested by friends..nothing but farm fields and a low hedgerow..I know without a doubt what this was..this was Stark County, Ohio.It was as if this thing was just watching, I know this isnt funny but it reminded me of the snuffaluffagus on sesame street..thats how huge it appeared..I called my daughter right away and had her talk to me until I could calm down There were a few large tracks - barefoot - the toes were clearly visible They both came back inside my son had the same description as me very very tall, very, very wide but he only seen the back of it as ran up the hill into the briers We only found 2 tracks about 6 foot apart, and slightly toed in I also seen a flash of silver or gray color by the forearm and head/face area like it looked my way in the last stride it took He says it had red eyes long arms with claws on its hands and strange looking feet for sure I started walking through the forbidden path and about half way through is when I saw something brown and hairy in a squatting position she closed her eyes and  screamed and at the moment of impacked it viered off and disapeared into the brush  While walking the banks for wood I noticed small barefoot human like footprints in the sand just at the waters edge  After progressing approximately 15 feet into the woods we heard loud unexplainable noises My uncle was about 30 feet ahead of me when I saw the movement of something big to our right But anyway, we were playing in the yard it was close to getting dark but still daylight enough so that you could still see  Now I knew what was responsible for the footprints found the previous year at Aurora Lake less than a 1/2 mile away  It moved around in the shadows, and stood watching them at about 30 ft but they could only see the dark shape outlined near a tree Its hair color appeared to be a light milk chocolate I saw a Bigfoot standing over our burn barrel  I stood there looking at the root disk and suddenly saw what appeared to be a dark face and broad shoulders It was covered in long, dirty brown hair My eyes had adjusted to the night and a shadowy figure of a huge being started to appear They showed me a picture and asked if that was what I had seen, and it was indeed a Bigfoot. This driveway was separated from the paved roadway by an embankment that rose from mere inches at the southern end of the marina to about ten feet in height near the northern end where Mr It looked around seven to eight feet tall I happened to hear some rustling on the ridge above us, and when I turned to look, I saw what I can only describe as a very large, bipedal creature, walking between the trees and brush I looked in the direction the dogs were barking to see a large reddish brown hairy bipedal creature running away towards the creek So I apologized to Andre and told him about the footprints The eyes never diverted for a moment, There was still no movement or response of any kind  I then shined the flashlight back in the woods looking for what ever owned them eyes, but to no avail  Our deck/porch is some 4 feet raised off the ground with the garage on the ground, based on my sons description of the height of the head in relation to the basketball hoop that was on the front of the garage, the thing was in the 7-8 feet tall range That sound just made the hair on the back of my neck stand up just thinking about it I have believed the evidence for Bigfoot to be overwhelming for a long time, so my first thought was, ""Is that a Sasquatch?"" Immediately I felt a small surge of both fear and excitement As for the creature, it was a male, looked young, around six feet tall Finally, all my brother could say was big, hairy, and building We were on our way home and drove across the second bridge when a dark shape on the south side of the road caught my attention, and apparently my wife and mother also I made it up to within a quarter mile from the tunnel when I couldn't go any farther in my Ford Granada with its tall snow tires  It was hard to see the legs, but those also appeared to be dark in colour My friend said that the way it looked at her with its big eyes made her almost go crazy in fright The being's head was about another two to three feet above that I went to the kitchen window and in the field right in front of me there stood a large black figure walking on two feet towards the cabin When it did she opened the tent where she heard twigs cracking and shined the flashlight in that direction when she saw its really big yellow eyes We went back to the large creek and crossed over and walked along the deer trail until we got about twenty feet from the area that we had originally crossed the small creek that took us to the field with the tall grass and he was walking in front of me he stopped and he was looking to his left and I asked what he was doing At a distance of ten feet away, I waited for an impact but surprisingly nothing happened My friend and I were stunned for a few seconds and saw something huge and hairy walk through a nearby clearing My mom called me at work and mentioned about a Bigfoot researcher being in town and he was on the six o clock news In fact, never associated the experience with Bigfoot until recently. i do remember doing some kind of research on bigfoots in Ohio, and read about a report in the Olentngy river around 1943 or so I got out of the car first and went up to get the key, when I reached around inside the door something pushed passed me in the dark Covered by hair and standing on two legs, not four It was toward the end of summer in September 2011 that I had my sighting of a tall hairy bipedal creature I decided to google Columbiana County, Bigfoot, 1994 and actually found the clip of the sound on this website I saw a large hunched over creature about 8 feet tall In my mind I ruled out a short or four legged animal because of the sound of the distinct footsteps in the water I stopped in my tracks when I observed directly to my left about 40 feet away a creature that was black, furry and had a massive wide upper body, large shoulders, arms and head On the floor up against the back wall was a large pile of pine fronds about 12 feet long and 6 to 8 feet wide, 8 inches to a foot deep and fresh As we approached the area we saw something very hairy and very large squatting in the middle of the road Once he showed us the spot, fear instantly came over me to know it was just a few feet from the window Since that incident there have been times when I have called him in at night and I’ve found him lying down in an alert position and, in the dark, be staring at that same spot, as if waiting to see the creature reappear She asked me what kind of animal has footprints like a human She said she never heard anything like that in her life and made the hair on the back of her neck stand up Jeremy is 6 foot and this thing just dwarfed him in size The body was very thick and its arms hung to about its knees  As he got closer to the eyes he said that what ever it was stood up and was at least one foot above the corn After this encounter, we came to a logical conclusion that what we were fortunate enough to see something that fit the description of the so-called animal called Bigfoot I use to watch the Finding Bigfoot show a lot, so we spent the rest of the car ride asking questions, explaining observations and possibilities The hair was a dark reddish brown and it had a matted and dirty look to it and most of the face was covered with hair but from what you could see it appeared to be of human trait After dark, the tree knocks began Then it hit me, I know there are no trees where this thing was and we were about three to four feet up on a porch and this thing was bigger! I turned again to get a better look, and this time I see it start to walk to the right behind a shed, the same direction we needed to go to get home  As I passed the tent next to mine there was what i take to be a young bigfoot (about my height, which is 5'7"") I would call it grayish brown, not like an ape, the facial features were flatter, more like a person's (not the big jaw an ape has) At that time it looked up at me with its red eyes and that is when my heart dropped to the bottom of my small intestine It crossed the road and the open area before the road when I first seen it in 3 strides and it was gone  I found this tree that used to be 12 feet tall  I told others of this sighting and was made fun of repeatedly until my neighbor just told me this morning of seeing the bigfoot in the same area I could hear something coming up the drive way about 30 feet from our room  I am certainly NOT saying that my wife and I had seen a Bigfoot, but we did see a bipedal “something” and heard some very distinct noises, and finally smelled something really nasty The trees that they shook were easy 25’ to 30’ tall I knew at once it was a Bigfoot It was in 1978 or around then that my brother and I saw Bigfoot I have been an avid hunter for over 25 years and I am convinced that bigfoots are out there i let this go on for about an hour and a half straight until we just couldnt handle the noise anymore.we sat very quietly in the dark for about 15 or 20 minutes when i told my brother i heard something coming through the woods in our direction.i just returned from a 19 month combat deployment in iraq and nobody was gonna sneak up on me anywhere,let alone in the forest at night  This particular tree had its roots exposed, but was still suspended, on the ""leaf-end"", about 3-5 feet above the ground due to a tangle of vines  All the hair stands up on your kneck and you get the fealing that that you are not welcome there at the time Mel asked me if I had any idea what that was, as I said, the sounds were obviously strides, not a deer crashing through the brush The eyes where clearly another 4 foot above the grass line These huge legs covered in reddish brown hair and one hand came into view About an hour later I spotted the 1st groundhog and centered the crosshairs of my .243 win on him and gently squeezed the trigger  Until we realized that we could see the top of the creature's head above a 8 foot tall road sign i dont know how long we were fishing but across the pond a figure stood up from the shoreline area and walked up a steep hill when it got to the top it turned back to look at us, the figure was large covered with hair and walked on two legs, it was winter the pond was frozen and the figure wore no clothes so theres noway it was a human we were arround 15 yrs old so we took off since we were scarred by this encouter I saw a glimpse of what looked like a small Bigfoot, three or four feet in height It was the time of evening that it was starting to get dark  My wife asked me to whoop or mimic a Bigfoot yell I am not tall but I didn't even come close to stretching my stride that far That is where a footprint was found.  I'm six foot tall  It was early dusk because I wanted to get some cigarettes at the store before it got dark Its face wasn't completely covered with hair I listened to the alleged Bigfoot howling on the BFRO website and have came to a conclusion that I'm hearing almost exactly the same type of howling in the woods behind my northern Portage County Ohio home  When I first saw the eyes, I stopped my car and just stared in disbelief We found what appears to be very very large footprints  The area was at least 8 feet wide by 14 feet long When we were about twenty feet away from the camp, the horrendous shrills stopped...again  It looked like something had matted down all the 4 to 5 feet weeds and trees into some sort of bed or nest They have to be really good at it to avoid all the people fighting to get footage with tripwire cameras and such I turned around to tell him to chill out while I lock up, when I noticed about 40 feet behind him someone was standing there As I was describing its gait to my friend--just like the classic bigfoot film footage on TV When he got his flashlight and went out to see what was happening, he saw a huge hairy thing on two feet running away Not long ago, I asked some friends if they've ever seen ghosts, Bigfoot, or anything else unusual We saw several that were walking on only two feet and had a very large stride, much larger than any of us could ever make Since the locals all knew about Bigfoot, its worth noting that this could have been a hoax pulled on the two boys It was dark, but the 'halo' around it made the edges appear a dark chocolate His friend, Chris Flick's older brother told Nick, 20 years ago, he and his dad both saw a Bigfoot walking through the woods on the opposing (their house) hillside...two different times I thought that it was too tall for a man (it appeared maybe 7-9 feet tall) in coveralls and took much larger strides than a man could In the summer of 1976, I (Laurie) was playing along the shores of Aurora Lake when I came upon a very large set of human like footprints It appeared to have its back to me, because I could not see its eyes or its possible its eyes may have been blocked by the braches She always has said I know that it is Bigfoot  I got back into the truck and we turned off of the road to the next left where the creek crossed and the ditch turned into a small thicket which is the direction what we both agreed, without a doubt was bigfoot, was heading I stopped my truck to get a better look and witnessed a large dark form walking through the corn stubble field heading towards the woodline It had dirty brown hair and what looked like white eyes We had never heard much about a Bigfoot at that time For sure not human, this thing had an almost 6ft stride and you could see the toes and the whole outline of the feet Besides, I thought, “Why would my 11 year old dog be going crazy over an owl perched on a branch fifty feet away from our fence?  How would he even hear an owl gliding so silently onto a branch in the woods at night?”  It’s also hard for me to believe that he would have happened to see an owl gliding onto a branch at night, but  When we pulled over to the field we caught a glimpse of eyes But what I saw was a human-like foot with hair that connected to a calf, to a knee, to a thigh then to a hip, and it was super muscular Also noted we noticed multiple footprints that looked to be from a child barefoot Then, on the left side of the road behind the fence was a large hair covered, gray or white colored figure standing by the fence line As it turns out, Mike was about 35 feet from this creature  They came in and told me so we went out with the camera and took some pictures of the woods in the dark We took a picture next to my husband's foot which is a size 13 It was sanded down smooth by something and has tan and black animal hair fibers in certain parts of the wood I am 34 years old now and to this day I can honestly say that I saw a young bigfoot that day Considering it was pushed from the woods inward and there's about a four foot drop behind the woodpile it was quite concerning to us I could hear my feet kicking up behind me, and behind that I could hear the sounds of twigs snapping turning into the sounds of limps cracking we started our way back into the woods and i ran down the hill and as i was waiting for my sister and cousin to make it down the hill, i got this feeling as if someone was watching me and i had got the goosebumps and there were no other sounds or animals around.it was about 7pm and i turned my head and saw a figure around the size of 8-10 feet tall on 2 legs, dark brown/black hair/fur and it had big yellowish eyes staring right at me It stopped about 15 feet away and stood up and it had to have been at least 16 feet tall!!! We then took off running for the car and the creature pursued us My uncle said that the creature was about eight feet tall and when it walked it too huge steps Keep in mind, my headlamp was only strong enough to light up its eyes and not whatever they belonged to The witness described what he saw as a tall, dark and hairy figure run and disappear into the woods It was mostly hair covered with some exceptions much like an orangutan A few days later he convinced me to take him back where it all happend and along side the road was a foot print that was fairly large but shaped different She noticed he wasn't with us and he was standing frozen with his fists clutched to his sides.His eyes were really big and he looked so scared.She then yelled at him and he turned and ran.I only noticed him not being with us  we all were in the van with the doors shut, car started, and he was then on the outside screaming to get in  My son described the creature as being very dark in color, with the hair very long and hanging down over its face, he couldn't make out any facial features About halfway up the hill in the woods the lights showed what looked to me like a monkey type of animal crouched down on it's haunches with it's arms extended in front of itself and between it's thighs Bigfoot hunter It's eyes were a gold/yellow, it was covered in brown fur, and in a hunched position It was very tall, my guess would be about 8 feet high or so Up burst a huge white ""thing"".i was about, 10 feet away My truck was 15 feet in front of me and a rock hit the water five feet from my truck which was parked next to the opposite side of the creek we were fishing We are guessing that it was around 8 foot tall. One set was slightly smaller but when up next to my 11 ½ size hunting boot it dwarfed my feet in comparison As I drove about 15 mph along these backroads, I rounded a slight turn where the banks on either side rose about six feet It was located a few feet inside the woods that bordered the opening of the waist high brush and brier patch This is something that happened 19 years ago while a buddy and me were fishing in the backwaters of Dillion Lake State Park in Muskingum County near Zanesville..Some of this was witnessed by 3 people as there are 2 different occasions that we saw & found evidence of Bigfoot..NO JOKE HERE I SWEAR!! First time in the same area we were fishing from the bank and ran into 2 different sets of foot prints that were going along the bank & the river..One set was very small..just like a child's but looked weird..second set was big! My friend has big feet & his boot went into this print we found..We found several prints..The thing is, it was spring and had been cold..No one would have been walking this bank in bare feet! Water was low because it was early spring..They drain water out of this lake in the fall to help prevent spring floods..A couple weeks later we were down at the same place but in my boat just 100 or so yards from where we were bank fishing the day we seen the prints..Anyway we were sitting in the boat and my buddy says ""whats that!?"" and down river at the exact spot that we had seen these prints was a very tall figure standing above the cattails on the edge of the river..very dark figure! BIG!! we were tripping out! This thing slowly stepped backward in where he had came from..The water was higher this day which makes the catfish bite good..This was near evening..I know this may sound funny but very true..Our lantern had quit working and because the fish were biting good we stayed..we had the moon to fish by and it was full that night so we could see pretty good..We stay when the fish are biting! We heard a noise on the bank like something big running toward us..heard a very big splash behind the boat..we were facing down river fishing horizontal to the bank..The boat ROCKED back and forth and we both hit the bottom of the board and hid! I was just waiting for something to bring his hand up on the boat..we were scared..I am fearless! We waited in the bottom of the boat for what seemed like eternity..We cut the anchor ropes and got outta there heading for the boat ramp..loaded that boat quicker than anything! I left my poles on the ramp because we were in such a hurry..We live 25 miles from this area and it was 10 or so years before we went back..This was a place we went every weekend as we are big time fishermen! Never witnessed anything like this ever before and we fish in secluded areas..I would like to show you this area and introduce you to the 2 other people..The other friend only witnessed the 2 sets of prints..I own my own business & am a Freemason..Thank you!  At about the same time as my wife said she saw the eyes, my oldest son was getting up to go outside on our front screen deck porch, as I was at the window, my son had just gone out the sliding glass door to the porch and was lighting a cigarette, as I turned away from the window, my son, opened the door and was yelling for me as he was pointing out the porch to the separate garage building that is next to our house, he dropped his cigarette and stood there looking for a few seconds and then quickly came into the house saying that he had just seen a big hairy thing looking around the corner of the garage in his direction (The land behind the Cayton's was an old abandoned strip mine and beyond that were dense woods going up a gradual hill.) Unusual, but unsubstantiated foot prints were discovered I do have that footage, and the wood knock can clearly be heard. To my surprise, my friend told me that she saw Bigfoot two times in her back woods It rose to stand on two feet and just seemed to keep going up and up, unfolding from its hunched-over position at the open of the can to stand taller than anyone I've ever seen - and I have a friend who's six foot-nine! Frozen on one knee at the stern of the boat, I just stared at the figure with my eyes getting wider and wider and a sick feeling forming in the pit of my stomach  My wife was sitting a watching TV, as were we all, we have a back window near the TV some l0 feet from where we sit, my wife suddenly said that there two eyes staring at her thru the window Once Joe managed to secure his feet in his boots we started our long trek out of the woods  As we were approaching our house down the street , something crossed the roadway  about 30 feet in front of us it had dark fur I would say it only took 3 steps to cross the 2 lane road, it walked on 2 legs and had considerably long arms, I was set back for a moment we do have bears up by us but this distinctly was walking on 2 long legs, definetly taller than my suv  What can I say?  I’m a female and I was alone at night in a park looking at strange eyes We all looked in the direction and witnessed a tall dark figure with yellowish green eyes walk from the left side of Lithopolis Road into the wood line at a normal pace taking very large strides Then it stepped over a five foot fence and walked off into the heavy thicket completely out of sight  I noticed the face had light colored skin and dark eyes FINALLY WHY DIDNT IT RUN AWAY WHEN IT SAW ME COMMING DIRECTLY AT IT.IT ALLOWED ME TO COME WITHIN A FEW FEET OF IT.I AM NO LONGER AFRAID OF IT, BUT I DONT THINK I WOULD WANT TO GET THAT CLOSE AGAIN She told me that this thing looked JUST like the Bigfoot from the movie ""Harry and the Henderson's."" When she saw it, it was walking away at a fast pace all of the legs were in the same direction like a bundle of dowel rods and there was clearly an imprint in the snow where ths sasquatch sat down in the snow against this tree and enjoyed his meal and neatly stacked the lower portions by the tree This time it seemed to be a bit louder and I looked over between the pine trees but I couldn't see anything but darkness (I hope everyone is still with me.) Keeping all of that in mind, you know how at night windows in your house act as a mirror because its dark outside but the lights are on inside She said it looked exactly like some one was walking around barefoot After walking the dogs, I did a Google search on three toe bigfoot tracks and found it was possible My father suddenly tensed up and in a very desperate voice, said something I won't repeat here, followed by ""That's bigfoot!"" Just then, whatever was standing on that bank turned it's head, and looked straight down the creek at us  Besides, no coyote’s or deer’s eyes are going to shine back at me ten or more feet up in the air  I couldn’t see the creature’s shape, so it (they) must have been very dark from top to bottom I have absolutely NO DOUBT that what I saw was a bigfoot  I didn't find out till later when we were hunting back there again, that it was bipedal, big and fur covered and dark gray to dark brown coloring It was walking on two feet very rapidly and she caight a glimps out of the side of her eye The foot print measured Length: 18"" Width: 9""-10"" Years later I saw the patterson film footage on T.V That is if it was a Bigfoot Okay, we have had more activity on our property and this time there are two three different sets of footprints, like a family so to speak I was 12 years old when my parents built our house right next to my grandparents, and then over a foot bridge to my great grandparents house I was 17 years old and fishing on a boat about 25 feet from shore Instantly, I was scared because the sound was very close to us, it was about 30 feet up in the thick woods, and it was very steep, almost straight-up  It was dark in color, broad shoulders, no neck, fur covered head to toe It was hard to believe what we had seen, we were totally in awe and just could not explain nothing else to what it was except a BIGFOOT! It was definitely walking upright taking large strides Than about a month later the same brother in law and his cousin were walking out of a hollow near dark when they heard the strangest animal they had ever heard It took huge long steps....that convinced us we saw a Bigfoot I could not believe my eyes so I bent down to get a better look as it moved rapidly behind a tree  It, again, was very difficult to see, but appeared to be completely black, powerfully built and running on two legs and I could only presume that they were headed for another section of woods across another field  The stride between each track was 6-7 ft It seemed that it covered about 30 feet effortlessly, it was very fast I think we were all shocked When I walked by the deer they stood still, then I saw the Bigfoot The hair on the back of my neck stood up and I froze I could see 2 humanoid legs for certain and it definitely wasn't a deer or anything on all fours Also, my large dog saw something after dark across the hollow the night before and went ballistic with his hair standing on end At about 1 am she woke me up in terror because it was outside our tent just feet from our heads pulling handfuls of grass The grass was thick and 3 to 4 feet high This story is just the beginning of an amazing six months of encounters and upclose sightings of an eight foot tall bigfoot that was very comfortable on my property and my family  I shouted to my husband ""DID YOU SEE THAT?"" He said, ""See what?"" I was all excited and couldn't believe that he didn't see it, but he had a good reason, he was focused on the steep hill and curve we were about to drive up and it was late and dark out While on our way down this trail I looked to my right and saw a dark shape, just the head, no neck and shoulders like what ever was there had 7 foot gait to it's walk The stride was at least 4 1/2 to 5 feet long To this day I will never forget what I had seen that day and I will remember it like it was yesterday and nobody can convince me that it was anything else other than what we call bigfoot At that point, the dark figure was just east of the trail cam and I was hoping it would cross the path of the trail cam, but it seemed to avoid that area This was new siding just installed in the spring! Needless to say, we were up all night It was leaning on one foot just looking right at me What I saw was a very large, dark brown, hairy creature They followed us, harassing all the way until nearly dark at the edge of the woods Anyone who has had the wonderful experience of seeing one with their own eyes knows the truth I must admit that I never believed in Bigfoot, but taking into account all the hair samples and an endorsement by Jane Goodall I must say I think I saw one from a distance of about 200 feet You could tell it had black hair but it also had lots of gray hair too I read your recent reports and was amazed that it was in the same area that I saw this large whatever on two legs It was standing at least 8 feet high moving its upper body in a back and forth motion in the tree branches surrounding it It was being about 7-foot-tall 150 feet away through my car windshield Once I'd thrown the third rock or so, the eyes moved away, directly back, like a person walking backward I have talked to others who have heard or have seen what may be a Bigfoot She claims to have  been within a few feet of a ""bigfoot""  in the yard and when she ran into the farm house she says the creature followed(?) Later we heard the ohio bigfoot recording howls and we agreed that it sounded identical No big fat footprints, no clumpy hair on tree branches, nothing We both knew it was a Bigfoot  A security light was in the distance on the other side so all I could see was a dark outlined shadow of a large person walking slowly away  I grabbed my gun and put it on my lap as I sat back down in the chair So we believe that we heard bigfoot years later  I turned to look and there was a large 6 1/2 to 7 feet tall carmel blonde creature staring at me The only thing that made any sense was that I had just seen a ""Bigfoot"". I have attended a seminar by Robert Morgan, and from what he described as a yell that a bigfoot might make, it sure sounded like it Both men agreed it had a low forehead, small dark eyes, huge hands, bulky body and a nasty smell So i estimate it at about 6 ft tall No patches of Yak type hair hanging from the trees While going down the road we came around a turn near the old coal mine scales and the headlights hit a bigfoot standing on the shoulder of the road I was frozen in fear! Just at that precise second a bus full of disabled teens with their caretakers were exiting their bus and proceeded to walk on the path a few feet in front of me This thing looked to be nearly as tall as a stop sign with very thick limbs When the gas and oil companies started installing pipelines years back we started having encounters  One day my girlfriend and I were back along the gas well road that brings you about 2000 feet off the main road I saw Bigfoot from the chest up just below my house, it was in a wooded ravine below my house Instead, what I saw was black hair taking up the entire window I looked over to my right and just about 10 or 15 feet away was this creature I found a hair sample on the barb wire My brother and I never thought about going back outside that same day we saw Bigfoot and look for footprints It did not look like a bear about the face and was about 6 feet tall This thing had to be at least eight to nine feet tall to be standing where it was There is no way it could have been a bear because bears can't run on two legs He pointed it out to Bob saying ""someone has been running around barefoot"" Bob just looked at it and said ""yep"" We were driving along when a very tall, large, fast moving creature ran across the road in front of us It never turned around but kept on walking toward the tree line...it had hair from head to foot...it swung its right arm as it strode away and seemed to be unconcerned that I was there  The type of cover that i have seen on the internet that people have described as bigfoot teritory is the ide4al cover around these sightings The river is not that deep..three maybe four feet Then, about a year later, while watching an episode of Finding Bigfoot, she heard the same sound that we heard that night at the lake After listening to the Bigfoot scream recording on your website I played it for two friends of mine and we all agree that it is exactly what we heard I called the others and my daughter’s friend put his foot next to it To repay in a way they offered me dinner and to prove to me that Bigfoot was actually around their property But as I got closer, I noticed that the eyes were to high off the ground to be a deer and when I took a closer look I saw a (7 or 8 ft.) tall man-like creature next to a big tree It was standing in a ditch beside a cement bridge that was about two to three feet above the road It was twice as wide and almost twice as long as my own foot 3 feet wide at side of road  As he came to crest of a small hill he said that he ahd seen this set of redish looking eyes Neither ever forgot it  or entered the property in the dark We estimate that where the eyes where on the window it had to be close to seven foot tall I was coming out of the woods with some wood to put in the back of my truck, when a big hairy upright creature ran across the road and disappeared into the woods in four steps (bigfoot did not even come into consideration) My son told me a few years back that he and his friend had seen a very tall hairy creature salvaging in the back of my husband’s truck near the shop late one evening It had been raining earlier that day and it appeared to have long stringy hair, deep set eyes, and very broad shoulders  At first they looked human, but I thought it was odd a person would be walking barefoot it some of the nastiest deepest and thick mud slop around While counting the deer, I saw what looked like a bigfoot near one of the deer  As it got dark, we decided to walk back to the car by way of the park's paved roads I have hunted all sorts of animals and I have never seen one with red eyes that seemed to glow in the light I was traveling on Little Kyger road toward Ohio state route 7 when I popped over a steep hill located one this stretch of road and as my headlights shown back down on the road as I topped the hill, along side the road there is a tree and a road sign, thats when I noticed this large very dark figure along the road with what appeared to be either very dark brown or black fur/coat?? it was a head taller than the road sign that it was walking in front(6 to 7 foot tall) of, it looked as if it was getting ready to cross the road out of a very wet swampy marsh area over into more wooded hills As we looked around, we saw a tall dark figure approximately 50 yards away standing behind a large tree  Upon arriving at the spot, I noticed something very strange!  On the right side of the creek bed, at about 20 feet away, there was a strange matted down area that I have never seen in the 10+ years of coming here  It was completely covered in reddish brown hair, and it stood up like a man  They thought they were the only two people ever to see a Bigfoot in Ohio so they kept it very quiet I looked in that direction and noticed a big, bulky, hairy creature I didn't know what it was either, but to me it just looked like a very hairy, slightly stooped man, especially when it looked towards us I have become very fond, but still scared of Bigfoot. 4"" wide about 1 1/2 depth stride around 4-4.5' We had turned in around midnight and it must have been about 3-4 am when I was awakened by this deep growling grunt that sounded like just a few feet from our tent A few years ago while I was out with my camera one afternoon I heard what I thought were Bigfoot howls or moans in Beaver Creek State Park  Then, it moved from behind one tree to another standing up on two legs the whole time  From where I was sitting the creature was as tall as our bugwacker as I pulled into my driveway aboout 200 feet back from road as we got out of the car their was an awful dead animal smell like rotted skunk and we heard breaking twigsand a sound like ""woot woot""  got spooked went into house The snow was very deep as we had to lift up our legs very high to get through the snow  With his eyes enlarged he replyed,  ""i dont know""  It had greyish brown long hair, particularly over the face, wide set eyes, ears on the sides of the head, and a huge chest and shoulders I was about 100 yds from my friends house when I got that strange hair raising feeling 3rd is I am 5'10'' and it took me 5-6 strides just to cross the road in that area which does not include the area that is viewable to the right of the road where the creature first stepped out into.4th is since I have seen this I have driven that road many times to and from work, I have been at about the same distance in my van and have seen joggers cross the road and their arms look like toothpicks compared to what I had seen on that day, as far as guessing a height of the creature I would say it was well over 6ft I noticed something like a large dark shadow looking in my window At this point Scott saw a bare footprint approx 11-12 inches long I got up and looked out my window to see this creature standing in the edge of the forest, roughly 70 feet away across a small stream and the road She shockingly agreed, saying she had seen TV reports of similar instances involving Bigfoot My friend said he saw it standing there bobbing up and down also, and that the tree limb it was holding onto was ten feet off the ground We were living in Tallmadge Ohio at the time of the incident  It must have stood 7-8 feet tall To this day, the only logical explanation of what I experienced is that I encountered Bigfoot It was approaching dark and we started home, about 1 1/2 miles through woods and a small cornfield I immediately felt physically safer in the house, but mentally and emotionally I was still very shaken and upset Now, these crashes, were strides, you could tell something big and heavy was striding up the hillside I'm not going to kid you, when you hear that kind of stuff when you are alone in the deep dark woods, it scares you for a minute No 3 inch deep massive foot prints, because the ground was incredibly dry The creature I've seen is small, only three to four feet tall, and is always in the shadows where I can't get a good look at it. So you see we were not Bigfoot enthusiasts on the hunt for the big score I saw, running at us on what appeared to be somewhat all fours but it wasn't a massive creature with long shaggy hair I'm a fairly serious runner and I know for a fact, that is totally impossible to run through the snow that quick  At this point I am convinced that bigfoot had been the visitor during the night He said when it got really close to him he then smelled it and it smelled like rotted garbage form the garage(haha)He even said he noticed clumps of mud hanging from its arms on the fur or hair As were trying to pull out the stick from the snow, the Bigfoot heard the noise and quickly turned around and looked at us in the eyes About 30 yards in or so the eyes reappeared in the same location it entered into the woods...low to the ground just above the grass line The hair color looked black, but could have had other colors with it It looked like a large hairy person on it's hands and knees chasing somthing small across the road like a feild mouse Witness said the first thing he thought of when he saw it was a Bigfoot  The noise was heard again and I saw it, and began shouting at my wife, ""There it is!  There it is!"" Together we saw what appeared to be a nearly 8 foot tall, dark colored subject looking at us I was close like 50 feet away from this thing at one point and it was early in the morning I couldn't believe my eyes She was on vacation so her place was dark and locked up  A furry creature between 7 to 8 feet tall was standing upright like a man staring right at us Its lower torso and legs were covered with fur except for some areas on its thighs and knees In 2011, I had my first sighting of a creature that was about 8 or 9 feet tall, with brownish black hair that contained some grey and red streaks I never found my pack, and had to give up the search as darkness was coming soon  Now, at no point did I have my glasses on which I use for driving at night, but, here’s my point – the eyeshine was at a height that I guessed to be about ten to twelve feet up After a few minutes, he finally told my dad that there was a big hairy man leaning against the building out back I have an uncle who is 6 foot 6 with large hands but these were much bigger! The skin looked dark gray to black, but again I only saw it for a second I turned back around and it was about 20 feet from me The whole property was dark but my dad's car was there  It was around 25 feet away My dog’s gaze then remained focused as he continued to bark at a location in the woods across the street about 15 feet to the left of my driveway, so, I presume that that’s where the creature probably took a turn and headed back deeper into the woods strides. My only conclusion at this point was that the ridiculous myth of bigfoot was real The opening was oval shaped, about 80 feet wide by 120 feet long with woods and brush surrounding it It was very dark, with bulging deltoid muscles I am telling you this only to indicate that I am quite accustomed to moving about in the dark and I have a healthy respect for the outdoors What I saw was a very tall black hairy thing walking down the road It had gray hair It stopped just a few feet from the opening to the path What Mike saw was described as between 7 and 8 feet tall; was white in color and the skin on its hands and face was black Me and a friend were shoveling snow in our driveway when we noticed two sets of strange barefooted footprints with about a three foot separation between each step  The next day I went out looking for any signs, I found nothing at the window or behind the house and garage area at the corner, I walked across a grass field that extends out from the side of the garage and did find what appeared to be a faint impression of a very large foot in a hard clay/sand non grassy spot"
Oklahoma,"First it was just footsteps we heard, then the bushes in front of the window moved, shook, and then a large hair covered face rose in the window IT WAS ABOUT 5 OR 6 YRS AGO ,NOT SURE BUT IT WAS ON TUESDAY NIGHT ABOUT 12-12:30 ME AND MY BUDDY WERE SITTING DOWN BY THE CIMARRON RIVER ,IT WAS A FULL MOON THAT NIGHT,I REMEMBER THAT BECAUSE IT WAS LIT UP.WELL ANYWAYS WE WERE DISCUSSING HOW TO HOOK MY BUDDY UP WITH MY COUSIN,THEN I HAD TO GO THE REST ROOM,SO I GOT OUT AND WALKED ABOUT 10 FEET FROM THE CAR,AS I WAS GETTING READY TO GO I HEARD THE GRASS IN FRONT OF ME MOVE,IT WASN'T THE WIND.I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS A RACOON OR A POSSIUM  I know I saw  the stride of a man as he ran from West to East After we drove home my mother described to what she saw in more detail, what she saw is as follows: a tall manlike shape with light from the setting sun ! behind it, she was unable to make out a face because of the light behind it, but she could tell that it was very broad shouldered and from the light surrounding it that it was covered in hair about 6 inches long and reddish brown in color So, needless to say, I'm not real happy about coming home from work after dark anymore I had never mentioned this to anyone for fear of being ridiculed, because not only did we see what we took to be a ""Bigfoot"", but the one that we saw was white I saw something (I'm not saying it was a bigfoot,) large bending over (its back facing me) It was taking long strides and was slightly bent at the waist Everyone admitted that the screams where totally unknown to them and that it was a very frightening experience  I also want to say that I have nothing to gain by fabricating a tall tale about Bigfoot By the time it was out of sight, I realized it was on two feet I even went to Honobia, OK with my daughter to the Bigfoot Festival in 2011 and learned a great deal It was standing completely upright running on two legs But the what I remember the most is the eyes they almost glowed.  Brown bears can't run with the stride of a man and they aren't that tall (around 6' or more) I observed three red cedars that were bent over at the 8 to 10 foot level, all pointing to the northwest By the time we reached the road it was getting dark enough to be hard to see I looked back and up the hillside above the cave probably 30 feet up I saw the head and shoulders of what can only be described as bigfoot The eyes especially, staring directly at me and the smell of something musky We had heard numerous owls and coyotes, etc., and I had studied recordings of common animal vocalizations so as not to mistake them for bigfoot related vocalizations It was dark, about 8pm The cemetary is enclosed by a hog-wire/barbed wire fence about 4 ft tall I only saw the back of it but he said it was NOT a human and was surely a Big Foot. As I said earlier the sun was going down and it was getting dark so we started back down the hill around where the gully terminated and up the dirt road that ran past the clearing where the car was parked The description of bigfoot, that I have heard over the last few years, fit the creature I saw face to face and I will never forget it.  It was getting dark so we got a small fire going in the fire pit The hair on the back of my neck stood up because it sounded ape-ish It was able to look straight into my cab so I would estimate it was between 7 and 9 ft tall. I have not searched for footprints and nothing was heard.After crossing road it disappeared into woods.  When it came around the trees we could see it was dark brown, covered with fur, and running towards the car (which we were still in) tall and had brown shaggy hair all over it similar to an irish setter dog It is heavily wooded enough that even in the bright sun it is fairly dark in there only a few feet in Thinking it was one of the cows they turned around and saw a very tall, hairy creature running away from them We felt pretty uncomfortable as the creek was shallow, around 4 feet, and there was a feeling that whatever was thrashing the brush, could easily come after us in the boat The local land owners had reported repeated incidents like this and recently had to clean a bunch of fist size rocks from the roof of one of their buildings located at the foot of that same mountain I peered into the thicket and saw nothing but a faint trail to the other fork of the creek, probably only about 30 feet away Thats when i saw a LARGE dark figure walking very fast Now it was dark the sun had set so they gave up What we found was very disturbing,trees snaped in half at 9 to 10 feet high, some very deep indindtions that were 12 to 14"" long Its eyes were reddish-brown in color, it had long arms and walked up right never taking its eyes off me, and I never took my eyes off of it It was one solid dark color from head to feet So I continued to climb the hill until a large piece of rock (it looked like a piece of ruined tombstone from the abandoned cemetery on the hill top but I am not sure) landed just at my feet and rolled down the hill with some force and momentum behind it The creature never looked in his direction, and continued to ""jog"" up hill on two legs after crossing the road.  Dark black hair, it seems to me the face was dark like the hair The witness, age 18, observed one bigfoot ""slowly jogging"" across Holson Valley Road; which is two lane blacktop, west of Cedar Lake I'd like to mention here that I never really believed there was any credibility in the big foot sighting stories, but I was quickly convincing myself that what I saw wasn't human One, it was over 1000 feet downstream from the bridge and there was no car parked anywhere near the bridge, two, we had been swimming and fishing for over an hour before I had the encounter and there was noone fishing by while we were there, three, there is no residence or access by road anywhere nearer than the upstream bridge, four, the terrain is extremely rugged, full of underbrush including a thick maze of briars and poison ivy, and from experience, anyone who is there is either fishing up or downstream, five, the treck up or downstream is rugged and time consuming to trevail causing one to wade, cross at fast water areas and walk in the water on slick mossy rocks, there is nothing that would bring one to that remote area unless they were fishing I always pictured them to have black hair, but this was brown  Everyone knows that a fence with 6 strands of barbed wire is at least 5 feet tall right I could see that the creature's face had wrinkles and very little hair around it's eyes and nose If it was a bigfoot, in my opinion from this happening of why they are so hard for people to prove is because they are so incredibelly fast The deputies arrived and again found nothing, and left.I never associated this event with the bigfoot until reading about other icidents.The stench is what ties it in for me, and the discription my son gave of the face in the window, the way this character acted just wasn't in keeping with anything I've ever known For an instant, I thought that it was a child wearing a dark colored snow suit, but as the moment passed, I became very aware that this was no child  Deer run on four legs!  Then they told me it was probably one of the brown bears (I say that because there does not seem to be much if any arch at least like a normal human foot.) Following this print is another large print however this print seems to be out of place as that it is perpendicular to the others and headed further up the debris pile The creature was described as 8 feet tall with dark brown frizzy hair and similar to a bear except that it was described as walking upright She then observed a creature approximately 10 feet tall and about 400 pounds It was large, red, and taller than me!” I asked him about the possibility that it could have been a deer standing on a berm and he said no it was all flat river bottom I was told by phone by a relative that three large manlike, hairy creatures were observed on a persons porch and yard There were things hanging in the hair, little sticks and undergrowth looking stuff, and it was really dirty The entrance I was looking into was about 5 feet high and 3 feet wide I came within a few feet of running over it At that point I became very still, hardly breathing, and I could hear heavy shuffling foot steps walking around the cabin on the others side I was about 25 feet from the cave when I heard a “huff"", like an animal snorting  The stand was about (8) feet off the ground and about half way down from the top of the hill It was dark in color I asked her what she had seen and she said that it was a big black hairy creature standing behind me and she couldn't scream because she thought that if she did, it would kill me  As we were both looking towards the pasture we noticed something approximately 7 to 8 ft tall running across the pasture My grandma ask me if i want to hike this mountain with her and i said yes well we began to walk up this mountain and i take off from her and go ahead and im rushing up the mountain when i hear someone runing a little ways up from me so i go to see what it is and i see these two tall white creatures and they have hair that covers their bodies and i could even see the dirt stains in their fur they were so tall there faces were covered by the trees I could only see it from the waist up because of the grass being so tall but it was at least 6 feet tall and around 275 pounds if not more was a Football player and was well over 6 foot 3 inches tall and weighted approx  There are various lights scattered out there on buildings and such but mostly very dark He described the creature as ""military brown"" in color, with long matted hair, heavy set, over 6 ft tall, ""fat head"" and whiskers There were about 12 splashing footsteps that sounded DEFINITELY BIPEDAL over a period of about 4 or 5 seconds “Omg, it’s bigfoot” I thought Various newspaper articles reporting possible bigfoot near Tahlequah, Oklahoma He estimated the creature to be 7-8 feet tall with a slight hunch I was still not sure if I was dealing with a bear or a bigfoot It was very dark brown or nearly black, thick neck with broad shoulders,and had a wide skull, it was at least 7ft.tall We used one piece of tape to mark foot prints and used two pieces of tape to mark the hand print Also this things abdomen was also tremendous and in a well defined v shape atop curvy big legs The legs were a consistent diameter from top to bottom and I saw no indication of a human-like foot, like the pants legs extended over a persons shoe It ran across the highway, covering the distance in only three steps, I estimate the creature to have been at least 8 feet tall, it glanced briefly in the direction of the car and I instictively applied the brake so as not to hit it The BFRO sponsored an expedition to investigate a series of reports of bigfoot related activity in Le Flore County, Oklahoma Their dog chased it but returned with it's tail between it's legs We had been broadcasting bigfoot vocalizations provided by the BFRO, hoping to hear vocal responses  It was like that only we were not at the movies!  This was real!  We were all frozen in our lawn chairs! No one could move! We kept waiting for whatever it was to jump out at us! We could hear branches cracking, crunching and rattling and I saw the tops of the trees shaking in a circular motion Its eyes seemed impossibly small for the size of its oblong head I saw no distinction in color, it looked like a solid dark blue or black That I saw it’s long hair dangling from its arm, shoulder to hand  I thought about running, but I feared that my footfall and rapid motion would catch the thing's attention and that it would then begin chasing me as is instinctive for a lot of animals I figured I would sit for a while and rest my tired legs then I would finish walking this finger all the way to the tip and look down it and into the valley across the way What you would most likely do is simply lift your left foot and pivot 90 degrees counterclockwise on your right foot with your head and neck froze in place to watch your target while moving 9 feet long and 6 or 7 feet wide, piled knee high on me When I did, I distincly saw the legs, from the mid thigh area down, (my vision was impeded of seeing anything higher than that because of tree limbs),of what I thought at the time was a man, another fisherman, about 50 feet away The following day we found several partial footprints along the creek bank on the West side of the road It was covered in reddish/brown hair and didn't look like a human or an ape, more like a cross between the two  The creature was huge and hairy The first feature I noticed was the unusually long arms of the thing  I went back later on after work to the site, and there were numerous footprints of all kinds of game; obviously it was a frequently used crossing for all sorts of animals. I slowed the truck down to get a better look when my son turned to look at what I was looking at and he said,""Dad,is that a Bigfoot?""and about that time it stood upright and looked at the truck.I replied ""I think so.""I would have to say it was about 7-8 feet tall and about 300-500 pounds with jet black hair and a cone shaped head and very well proportioned [The hair] was about three inches long and coarse in appearance  The legs were hairy and were moving It was dark The following day, while walking through the area, myself and one other located three full footprints and one potential track on a road leading up the hillside toward the top of the hill  We were in a hurry to make the springs before dark, so we pressed pretty hard on the trail...we had 7 miles to cover quickly The figure was in bright sunlight so I immediately recognized it as walking on two feet The entity that I saw was about four to five feet long with about half of that being arm As I approached this area, my eyes were immediately caught by someone down below at the river edge The hill was thickly covered in Sumac, which would be very difficult to navigate, especially in the dark I also saw something black about 25 feet from the fence as if it had come to a sitting position and i kept my eyes on it and when i got to the intersection i turned to see if it was there but didnt see anything  I looked at the two trees that were shaking and they were fairly close together, I’d say about 10-12” apart at the base, they were 30’-40’ tall and about 12”-18” diameter He said he ""nothing to base that on"" and that it was unusual for a bear to walk on it's hind legs for very long While my son and I were camping in the Quachita National Forest on Oct 19 2001, in McCurtain County we discovered 4 large foot prints and one large hand print I raised my shotgun and looked at it with my scope when I realized what I was seeing was not a tree but a large creature like I have never seen before, it stood about eight feet tall, had charcoal dark color hair covering its entire body He slowly turns his head and he had the evilest yellow eyes I have ever seen It had long, straight brown hair, though, like a dog or something said he seen it ( a large Hairy animal) standing about 20 feet from him I did not notice the legs or head of the thing I guess there is something to the sign I saw on Indian highway "" Indian HWY Home of Bigfoot"". Whatever was on the hill started approaching us, maybe about 100 feet away  Only inches away there was a dark and greasy spot that smelled, not surprisingly, like a dead dog...horrible Using dollar bills as gauges to measure the length not only of the footprint, but also the stride between tracks, I would quite accurately estimate that the prints themselves were over sixteen inches long and the stride nearly five and a half feet The hound's eyes were still present and untouched Whoever was down at the river, began to walk inland using it’s arms to move the reed bushes The ribs and the sternum, as I recall, were still held together by this stretched out ligament.The head was totally untouched except for the .22 cal The first print seen is a left foot, then comes right foot about two feet away, then comes left foot about 8 feet further up then about 3-4 foot away and slightly higher up the (what I will call for lack of a better term alluvial fan, because off this bank the soil and rock is washed down into a pattern like that off larger areas such as the sides of mountains, etc.) Following the left hand print comes another left foot print about 3 feet away, however this print only shows the toes and about 1/2 of the foot it appears to have been made while the foot was rotating off the ball and toes, and stopped at what with some caution I will call the arch I'd say it was roughly 7' tall I was chatting on the phone when I noticed movement that was shaped like a man walking across the field in front of some medium sized trees...The head was about halfway up to the top of the trees, which would have made them about 7-8 feet tall  Secondly, I noticed that it was covered by reddish-brown long hair The hair did not appear to be stiff like an animals hair but more soft and shiny  It was probably around five feet tall, and weighed about 160lbs I think I would rather of seen a UFO though, the looks you get when you say ""I saw a bigfoot"". Occasionally I heard big sticks breaking under the foot falls Having set up camp we proceeded to stay up until near dawn, occasionally playing the Sierra bigfoot vocalizations, and patroling the area Her brothers and sisters said they seen tall creatures with trees on there head.I believe that there is something in those mountains and it s more than one that have made it their home. Before dark, I had deployed a primate pheromone chip supplied by BFRO curator Dr It was dark and we only had one flashlight I found foot prints in my yard   It was quite large, at least 4.5 to 5 feet tall in the squatted position We had a very good view of a large biped covered with brown hair, except for white patches on the pecs (chest) and one of its arms I also didn’t notice any distinct clothing but hair alone She would just stand between my legs and growl and bark, this is a big dog, a German Shepard One evening in September of 1979, my friend and I were sitting at Jumper Cemetary about dark on a full moonlit night In early summer 2007 I was headed north from Big Cedar on 259 and saw a tall dark figure cross the hwy about 1/2 mile ahead of me Not dark enough that you can’t see but you certainly would not need sun glasses in there Suddenly, at about 11:30 PM, I heard heavy foot falls in the brush to my east It was clearly fashioned into a large sort of oval shaped nest about 6 feet across Three to five minutes later I began having the feeling of being watched, and it was starting to get dark I saw a hairy medium build creature about six foot tall with long arms crossing a dirt road I have seen many football games and some of those have been up in the nose bleed section and those guys even that high up look big  The branch that the creature had been pulling leaves from was over 11 feet in the air  It was the end of May and we decided to do some night fishing but arrived well before dark I say hair and fur as it flowed as it ran It had a shaggy coat (the breeze did a fair job of breaking up its silhouette) that was dark colored even with the aid of my scope all I could tell was that the beast was covered in fur and that it was of dark coloration Also by using my own height as a scale which is 5'11"" and the car as a reference we were able to determined that it was approximately 7 feet tall It ran by moving its legs back and forth, not together as in how a cat would run fast It was really tall, even bending over the way it was Another football player E.N There have been an abundance of Bigfoot sightings in this area the 2 years We have lived here  Now at this location it happens to be at the back of the house and there is a chain link fence and about fifteen feet seperating me and this creature 300 feet away My family resides close to Norman, Oklahoma, and from 1976 to the present, there have been numerous incidents revolving around Bigfoot, including two sightings in 1976 and one in January 2003, footprints in both mud and snow, several incidents where vocalization was heard, and numerous other accounts of stones being thrown, foul odor being smelled, fruit being taken off of trees, etc  I have read some of the other reports and alot noticed a pungent odor but I did not and I believe that there was only fifteen feet at the most between me and this creature The ""thing"" glanced our way as it ran and seem to have dark or black eyes  I didn't notice how dense the hair on the body of this creature was so it could of added to the size of what I saw This clear area is about 30 feet or so in diameter The two sets of calls that I heard were very distant, but definitely similar to the bigfoot vocalizations the BFRO has recorded near Lake Tahoe, California It, just like up in the dish it gets dark in there long before the sun is fully set So from my 12 o’clock position to 180 degrees to my right (clockwise) I had a totally unobstructed view It was bent over in a ditch by a guardrail and was about 5 feet tall squatted down As we listened to this sound come toward us, we were incredulous as we saw a large hairy man looking thing walk up to the fence and step over it My mind had a hard time accepting what my eyes were seeing I don't know if this will help but I just saw a show on bigfoot and thought what the heck One was 3ft long the other was 5ft long, and they were about two and a half feet tall (I did ask the local scoutmaster if they take scouts into the area and they said no, they do not.) I continued to hunt, and 150 feet away from the nests I discovered a tree, 12 to 14 inches in diameter, was broken at the 5 foot tall level, and leaned over against another tree Extremely dark brown to black  The next morning we walked down to the trees that were shaking to look for footprints It was covered in long brownish hair I was going to chase it but [I saw] this huge, smelly, 8  foot tall, red mud clay color thing (as little as I was I thought it was a tall man until I hollered hey who are you I back my truck up 20 feet and stopped and we heard a second louder ""ape like"" sound from a second location in the tree line We were driving north about a mile or two from my moms house in the back roads of Stecker , driving about 40 miles an hour (we were taking my sister back home who lives about 8 miles away)when all of a sudden we saw what looked like a grayish looking football player streak across the road I made a cast of one and it shows some toes, an arch and even the foot ball. It is not a material that is condusive to holding any print of any kind for very long and they will be gone totally after the first rain He stood about 9 to 10 feet tall with almost like a dark fur coat It was covered with dark hair I'd guess about 6 or 7 in long  It was on the balls of its feet with its hands in the water We totally forgot about my friends cousin who seemed confused when he finally caught up with us  Always made sure we were home before dark I had been clearing out the area of Johnson grass for about 15 minutes when I heard large impact sounds approximately 25 feet to the north of me  I also clearly heard the sound of footsteps in the leaves as the branches were being broken I mention to my sister in the front seat it's awful late to be walking down a dark road without any type of lights They crouched into the tall grass and then I lost sight of them until they walked off into the darkness and more trees...all I could see was a dark outline and the gait was very apelike..arms swinging at the sides...Their body seemed to turn at the waist to look my way.. The prints were in a single line and you could follow the prints for a space of roughly 15 -20 feet I saw a Big Foot outside of our bathroom window in Anadarko today 4/26/12 around 12pm  Well, it stepped over that like it wasn't there and kept on going to the East taking long strides and swinging its arms back and forth while it walked Having had the benefit of finding a footprint when I was 13, my interest in bigfoot has led me to privately research the subject for many years I immediately began to reach for my phone without taking my eyes off the creature, that is when it noticed me No sooner than the echo died away I heard heavy footsteps like the sound of a man running, going away from us towards the car and the gully , these sounds ended with a heavy thud like something jumped off the edge of the gully and landed on the steep bank One told the other to be on the lookout for large manlike hairy creatures  Of course, considering the brief span of observation time, the distance (about 200 to 300 feet from me), and the lack of additional evidence, I still cannot be positive that what I saw was genuine. I know it wasnt no deer because whatever it was, it was on two legs,grayish, and was built like a football player  When I saw it crossing the road it could have been hiding in tall grass afterwards.  I just saw Bigfoot."" Since my brother-in-law was snapping kindling over his knees, we have come to the conclusion that it was this noise that drew the creature to him. At the time I had no experience with Bigfoot, and only came to realize these events were Bigfoot related when I heard the extended ‘whoop’ vocalization It had hair that looked rather silky as it ran, I remember seeing the hair move as it ran Several of the other football players said they were there when it happened, but didn't see anything, except E.S I didn't think much about it until we were on our way back home and as we approached the area where she said she saw something I noticed a sign that said, "" Eufaula Exit"" and then I remembered seeing a special on cable about Bigfoot sightings in Oklahoma and one of the places that talked about was Eufaula. I can best describe it as primate looking animal that stood more upright than a gorilla but somewhat stooped, it slowly swung its arms, and had a slight knee bend. Also, for some reason, I seem to remember that the arms had less hair than the rest of the body  A few days later we were in the same general area and noticed some long white hair hooked on the top wire of the fence The following day I returned to look for footprints but was unable to venture into the overgrown foliage It was dark grey or black, short hair, about 36” long and about 24” high After further investigation we found 4 large foot prints  Still being very dark that morning I nocked an arrow and settled in to my stand The hair on its legs seemed to be longer the the rest of it's hair  Something heavy footed was walking towards me from behind I always thought they were kinda kooky, probably just people mistaking deer or maybe even a bear for bigfoot You would only have maybe 5 feet of space to walk the length of the finger clear of trees It was pretty clear all the way to the bottom and probably 80-100 feet of vertical drop The only time I've heard anything like it was on TV during the big foot shows We were driving alongside a treeline when we spotted eyes shinning in the light about 150 feet away next to the trees At this time I froze and began to scan the ridge line first with my eyes and then with my rifle scope, and I began to think that one of the guys I was hunting with was playing a prank on me All the soft tissue (organs/muscles/connective tissue,etc.)was gone (with the exception of the entire head, the four paws and the skin and hair)  We're not saying that this was a bigfoot, but we've spent quite a bit of time outdoors and haven't heard anything like this previously The other entrance was about 30 feet from the first and roughly the same size I am 6' 2"" and 260 lbs but this thing was at least 9-10' tall and three or four times as broad as I am As it began to get dark, I attempted to light my old Coleman lantern but couldn't get it to generate so we packed up and moved over closer to the boat ramp where there was some light from a street lamp   My father asked what I thought and my first thought was It's a bear but, as I watched I realized a bear did not have long arms that could reach 3 feet over it's head  It was close to 7 feet tall, had long white hair (at least a foot), was walking on two legs That the FBI was called and samples of blood and hair have been taken for testing By the time he entered the house he was visibly shaken and according to my sister, he was ""as white as a ghost."" The hair on his arms were standing on end caused by physical reaction of goosebumps due to the state he was in I can offer no other suitable explanation for this event other than bigfoot  We were about 100 yards from approaching an intersection when I saw a [dark hair-covered, manlike] creature on two legs crossing the intersection we were about to turn on I waded down to where I saw it leave the water, and sure enough, there was a wet footprint on a big rock and several sprinkles on others rocks and dirt on the bank At the tip was a huge oak tree I am 5ft 10 and it would have took two of me to wrap my arms around this thing I continued to listen and what ever it was walked to the window at the foot of the bunk bed and then returned to the head of the bed, standing behind me I was sitting about 30 or 40 yards away from that chip in an elevated observation platform about 15 feet off the ground My estimations from the size of the creature to from where i was standing, it was probably somewhere around 7-8 feet tall At that point, the creature was approximately 15-18 feet away from him, standing in enough of a clearing so that he could see him from the waist up (due to thick underbrush he could not see any further down)  My friend saw two legs dangling down  After that, my husband and I went for a walk in the woods to gather firewood before it got too dark The dark greasy spot was about three feet in circumference and was on very hard flat ground It would have looked like a small dark person I work in a dental office, and happened to look out of the window and saw what I automatically knew was a bigfoot/sasquatch, walking beside an abandoned house  The creatue I observed was not as ape like as seen on TV he was not short legged and big bellyed with dangle ape arms Another truck was passing me and his cab was just about 5 feet from the front of my truck  The legs and torso were too long  He was very tall with a longer torso than an ape, the arm were longer than a mans and the body was covered with very thick and black-black hair, i was struck by the ease inwhich he strooled form the treeline the blackness of the creatue and his size In the fall of 1971 while i was in High School, it was close to the High School football Homecoming, because several of the students were at Dressers Ranch Barn preparing a Homecoming float, when several menbers of the Talihina, Oklahoma High School football team, drove up to the Barn yelling and Screaming that they had seen something in the woods on Green Hill Road The steps had been so slow and deliberate that no cadence could be detected to determine whether it was 2 footed or 4 footed It was approximately seven feet tall  It was probably about 3 to 4 foot wide  The dark hair was shiny in the car light but it was hard to make out the exact color I saw the out line of some thing big and dark colored but being dark it is hard to say for sure My wife, children, mother, sister and brother-in-law were swimming and fishing about 500 feet upstream at our swimming hole  I had a very clear view of it, and could see that it was black, or very close to black, and covered with long hair or fur from head to toe There was nothing noticible on the dark spot, just a dark tint to the ground A hairy bi-pedal creature carrying a calf or deer carcass over its left shoulder crossed the road from East to West, approximately 150 yards in front of my pick-up truck during a brief rain storm At the time of this incident, I had never heard of such thing as a bigfoot or sasquatch  Once it was dark, the noise from the frogs and insects was loud enough for us to comment about I dont think what i had my eyes on was what i saw crossing the road but i did see something about 5-6 feet tall cross the intersection fast and step over the fence Since that time I live in LeFlore County, Oklahoma.Last Spring while Turkey Hunting with my brother at Big Cedar,OK he had an encounter with one that was about 8'-9' tall this thing shook him up pretty bad From the top of the finger I was walking I could see very clearly down to the bottom of the saddle which was no more than 100 feet to the floor nearest the mountain and as you walked the top of the finger away from the mountain this finger sloped downward toward the valley so that by the time the finger ended the valley within the saddle was no more than 50 feet from the peak of the finger to the valley within the saddle When he was finally able to calm down, all he could get out was ""Bigfoot 20 to 25 feet long that sits approx 50 yards behind their house Then the next though through my mind gosh that is a cone head (from the movie) with hair Bipedal with long arms It ran upright and held its arms to its side as opposed to having its elbows bent like a man would   Very tall in that way Back in 1976, Bigfoot researcher Bob Stamps and his partner took several plaster casts of footprints and interviewed family members who had heard and seen the creature BUT NOTHING CAME OUT OF THE WEEDS,SO I TRIED TO GO AGAIN AND SOMETHING MOVED AGAIN,WHEN I TRIED LOOK DOWN IN THE WEEDS TO SEE IF I COULD SEE ANYTHING I NOTICED SOME MOVEMENT ABOVE ME,THATS WHEN WHAT EVER IT WAS CAME OUT REAL SLOW AND STOPPED.THATS WHEN MY HEART STARTED POUNDING REALLY FAST AND MY LEGS WENT NUMB.IT WAS ABOUT 8 FOOT TALL AND HAD VERY BROAD SHOULDERS,I COULD TELL IT WAS HAIRY JUST BY THE MOON LIGHT AND ALL I COULD SEE WAS A SILOETTE OR THE OUTLINE OF WHAT EVER IT WAS.WE BOTH STOOD THERE LOKKING AT EACH OTHER,THEN IT STARTED MOVING AGAIN THATS WHEN I TURNED AROUND AND JUMPED IN THE CAR AND TOLD MY BUDDY TO GET THE HELL OUTTA HERE,THERES SOMETHING OUT THERE.WE LEFT AND CAME BACK THAT SAME NIGHT AND GOT STUCK ,BUT WHAT EVER IT WAS MOVED ON.I SAY IT WAS ABOUT 12 FEET IN FRONT OF ME,THERE WAS NO SMELL OR ANYTHING,I JUST FIGURED EITHER IT WAS ALREADY THERE WHEN WE PULLED UP OR IT CAME CAME UP THROUGH THE OLD DUMP WHICH WAS BEHIND THE TREES THAT THIS THING CAME OUT OF.I TOLD MY AUNT ABOUT IT ,THATS WHEN SHE TOLD ME OLD STORIES ABOUT THE RIVER,I GUESS ALOT OF PEOPLE HAVE HEARD IT OR SAW IT.BUT THATS WHAT HAPPEND. It was about 8' tall or more While we were discussing what to do he yelled what in the **** is that? My 8 yr.old ran into the kitchen, they both had seen a face in the picture window behind the sofa.The eldest said it was hairy and dirty My 61-year old brother-in-law was chopping wood and breaking kindling approximately 40 feet from his house near the edge of the woods I would guess it was 300-400 lbs, kinda reddish brown hair covering its body On a trip back to our facility a very large hairy creature ran across the road in front of me As I watched this “man” down at the river bank, I started to notice settle detail like golden-red hair in the sunset It was in full stride, in the edge of the water, walking out of the water onto the bank at the right  We thought it was deer so we went on about our business telling ghost stories and bigfoot stories when all of a sudden  the trees in front of us started shaking violently! It sounded like something very big was coming thru the forest towards us!  Like a dinosaur movie where you see the forest moving and hear breaking of branches long before the dinosaur jumps out After a few seconds, I heard a more ""splashy"" ""plooorp"" sound followed immediately by foot falls racing down the water in the creek bed about 25 yds to my west The creature has hanging from the lower branch with its arms much like an orangutan does; in fact, the hair and the way it hanging from the tree made me think of it as an orangutan When I saw it, and I only saw it for a second, I that it was someone who was wearing dark navy blue overalls This was totally unlike the roar  It was covered with dark brown longish hair Deputy Joe Weavel investigated the reports and found impressions big enough to place both his feet in said ""mom I think I just seen Bigfoot or something walking into the woods, I asked her what was it and she stated that whatever she saw looked like a man but had brownish hair all over it's body"
Ontario,
Oregon,"The guy I was with  was 6'2"", and it was a little taller than him  The Bigfoot stopped in a small patch of the reprod where there weren't any small trees In the distance approximately 120 yards, I saw first what i thought was a bear foraging ...It saw me and took off on two feet straight up this ridge The hair on the peak of its head occasionally flared up and was additionally ruffled by the wind It also looked like there was a foot impression on a log that had fallen across the spring This job was located around 40 to 50 miles north east of Estacata Oregon in the cascade mountains south of Mount Hood, elevation around 3500 feet.  I believe this was my first Bigfoot sighting It was a bare foot and just slightly bigger than my male size 10 1/2 in combat boots My hair was sticking up and it quite literally scared the hell out of me  Within seconds I told my friend something was stalking us and we needed to leave NOW and looked back to the log -- 25 feet beyond the log was a clump of scrub oak it was covered head to foot in hair, dark brownish in color and i got a very (too good actually) look at it  She was very certain that it was on two legs The hair stood up on the back of my neck We found the circle where it was napping, round and about 7 feet in diameter  Across the lake from me, the embankment rose up about 10 feet with slick leaf brush all over it when I was awakened by heavy, bi-pedal footsteps walking around my 12 x 60 ft mobile home Everyone thought they were gunshots but this was a really dark night and these sounds were coming from pretty deep in the thick forest accessed only by not well traveled logging roads and from at least 3 different sources that for the life of me, sounded like they were communicating so I ruled out gunshots tall sprang from the woods It was between 6 and 7 feet tall, and had it been a man, I would have called his weight at about 270 This camp used to be an FBI training camp, I was told, and it had a track and training stations around the football field and farther down the hill towards the creek where the road and the town of Troutdale sat Me being the fool I am, said ""Bull"" and headed upstairs to get my coat and boots on and headed out into the snow storm to the football field to find out what was up  He also told me that his uncle was one of the big Bigfoot explorers At the sighting location the road was atop a wide, flat ridgeline covered with a few trees, bushes (possibly sagebrush) about 2 to 4 feet high and scattered clumps of bunch grass I saw a large animal covered in long hair in a field to the right of the road  I remember I had NOT seen any car lights approaching the mountain, and since the last 2 miles of the road could only be traveled by foot, four wheel drive or mountain bike, I knew that few, if anybody, would be nuts enough to make that climb in the dark, let alone during daylight   If we would have known about the possibility of it being a Bigfoot, we would have searched for more evidence, or perhaps we would have been more bold during the encounter—easy to say in hindsight though They were about 300 to 500 yards away from us; the big one was about 6-7 feet tall and about 300-400 pounds; very muscular The sound seemed to get closer at times, but never sounded close enough that I thought we were within its eyesight of the Bigfoot/Sasquatch/Yeti/Skunkape  I didn't measure the heel, but the foot didn't taper as quickly as a human foot It took about five very big strides into the brush, and we couldn't see it anymore It was dark blackish and I have to believe it was young, not broad just stocky I chatted with them a couple minutes, then walked over the area that the bigfoot ran I couldn't make out features as it was dark but the lights of my pickup slightly illuminated the area where it stood as I went by I asked him what he saw and he told me that while sitting by a log at the edge of a clearing, a large hair covered animal 6 or 7 feet tall  walked across the clearing in broad daylight about 50 yards in front of him By the sounds of its running I'm convinced it was on two legs, not four and that scream was nothing I had ever heard before or ever want to hear again We joked about bigfoot coming that night but I was shocked this last year when I was listening to some of the bigfoot recordings on this site and then heard the moan howl from Columbiana, OH I also had read a book about Blue Mountain Bigfoot that Vance Orchard had wrote About the same time my mind was coming to the realization that it was not a bear because it was walking on two feet and my friend started to make this ""hooo hooo!"" kind of sound and pulled his legs up to his chest fetal style At that time I jokingly said ""There he goes right there"" as I told my friend earlier that bigfoot was supposedly seen in this area before Unfortunately, when we got to our destination, I was the only one in our group that wanted to look for Bigfoot I SAW IN THE MIDDLE OF FOUR TREES THAT THERE WERE SMALL BRANCHES PACKED DOWN AND RED BROWN TUFTS OF HAIR The river is approximately 50 ft wide, swift, and could be as deep as 10 feet  After about 30 minutes I decided that I needed to get going because It was approaching 2:00 pm and would be dark before 4:00 in the trees We saw Elk prints and the 'footprints' seemed to occasionally jolt to the side..  It was coming from the creek bottom and made the hair on the back of my neck stand on end We started poking around the streambank (the stream was probably 15-20 feet wide) looking for Indian artifacts, animal tracks, wildflowers, anything interesting We observed  the animal had come down a 10 - 12 foot embankment, about a 15 degree incline On the way, Angela said she had enough and didn't want to be around the bigfoot anymore It was dark  The foot prints away were about 20 inches long and about 7 feet heel to heel [My eyes] did get drawn to the shoulder area which was very wide and that's when I noticed something that makes me think it was not a trick or hoax  It was brownish and hair covered  I was about 60 feet from a muddy creek, kind of a swampy area The limb that we saw the creature behind was about six and a half feet tall It was very hairy, and black, and at first glance, I thought it was a black bear(which I've seen before)  It struck me that it was very unlikely to be a hoax as no one would expect anyone to be out walking in that area, so an unlikely place to place bogus footprints  They came in on foot, from down the road, but did not see anything when they looked around. I saw the bushes moving and I saw what looked like a very tall,  broad, stout, hairy person, almost ape looking, with long dark brown hair Because of the ravine setting and the tall trees around us, darkness settled in quickly  In other words these rocks were not 5 or 6 foot in diameter boulders I smelled that smell but by the time I got to my feet to look out the window all I saw was something large and dark walking on two legs, heading back into the trees I believe that I saw a Bigfoot in Oregon back in the 80's  I remember looking for any kind of evidence that a human might have left but saw nothing, not even hair or other bits of debris What I did notice was it looked like a lot of the Bigfoot that I have seen on TV shows Anyway, this is what I heard; it was definitely a scream and not a howl or a whoop, and frankly, if I had not heard recorded Bigfoot sounds previously, I don't think I would of known what to make of it It had reddish-blonde like hair and was about 6ft tall The headwaters are beneath Reid and Sandy Glaciers at 6000 feet in elevation The creature was viewed at a distance of approximately 130 feet when a car’s headlights backlit the creature as it ran from left to right across the road from the witnesses perspective There looked to be a single part of a foot print .. The bigfoot or whatever it was came from behind a tree and ran quickly into the woods  One was kind of shaped like a peanut, but I can not remember which side of the foot the pad was  This was a 25 foot tower from the ground to the catwalk  He said he had seen bigfoot several times and began going on about how the Indian believes it is a spirit and such The approaching individual seemingly took no notice of the dog, did not break stride or slow down but kept getting closer with its steady stride  To the Southwest the mountain slopes off and down and is covered not only by large river rock or perhaps tailings, but also by dense, thick hairy manzanita In face-on view, the individual had a huge head and masssive shoulders, no visible neck, with a peak to the head and backpack-like hump on the shoulders, long arms with hands hanging clear of the torso to either side almost to the knees and a narrow waist  I heard many stories from solid people about encounters with what they believed to be Bigfoot. I believe in my heart bigfoot was in my yard that night Its arms swung wildly when it ran That night we went to the beach and built a campfire and I noticed footprints in the sand  Like if you were to sit over your feet in a crouched position My job was to install radio signialing equipment on logging equipment  This one particular day, in a meadow above and east of the Sandy River, I encountered a clump of birch tree saplings (4.5 inches in diameter) snapped off at about the 6 foot level and the tops were made into a family ""nest"" (space for 3 to 4 people)..  It did not have four legs, but two arms and two legs BY THE TIME WE GOT TOGETHER IT WAS DARK We got out and I climbed the small incline that it had come down to investigate and after 30 min or so found a barefoot track 18” long x 7½” wide and got video of it As the ground became level at the bottom of the saddle there was a single pine tree about 9 feet tall in the middle standing by itself I am 5'5"" and the trailer is taller then I stand There was still enough light to see but it was getting near time to go and Babe looked across the hill and her eyes got huge as she reared back trying to get loose The car was 20 to 30 feet away and down slope from me The creature walked upright, had a flat face, unlike a bear, a flat chest, and it swung its arms as it walked, very much like humans do He told me that he had seen a big foot while hunting that day It had black hair which was pretty long That's how I figured the stride My wife saw it standing there by the road before it moved and clearly saw hair and could see both sides of the torso  I briefly described the sighting and asked if they had seen bigfoots in the Oregon  It covered 30 yards distance in a few strides He, just as startled, stood up from the 5 foot high stump he was resting his butt against, and began to run away from me up the creek as I ran down the creek It was 7+ feet tall, huge shoulders, covered in reddish blonde, brown hair, no neck, pointed head, long arms and shorter legs unique, as it made the hair on my neck stand up Bucky was under the bed with every hair on his body standing straight up and growling so deep in his throat, I thought he was going to bleed  It was getting dark by then so we turned around and decided to stop and relieve ourselves Estimating distance from where we were to the creature, perhaps 60 to 75  feet in front of us Upper and lower legs seemed of normal relative proportions, but longer than human proportions in reference to the upper body It had long brown hair and looked like a bear ""Uncle Ron, look at this foot print!""  Off the trail a foot or two was a large print made in dried mud, (the last rain in the area was about 6 July 2003), so the print was well defined and clear as the photo shows The color of his hair covered body Too much snow, about waist deep - I'm 6'2"" tall -  for a  cougar etc Disappointed but not dissuaded, I tried to keep the rest of the group (2 guys and 1 girl) at least somewhat interested in the Bigfoot search, to little avail very big.! Dark colored Wes told me he definitely saw what he belives to be a bigfoot  Dark brown, shaggy, little or no neck, long arms, and stood on two legs As darkness fell, we sat out in the dark talking about our lives  Whatever was in the trees was making a low, soft grunting sound and it's footsteps were audible and heavy It walked in a simi-crouched position and had to have been at least 7 feet tall It didn’t really look to me as something authentically Bigfoot because the foot seemed thin I told myself it couldn’t be a footprint of a Sasquatch because I had read some stories a few weeks earlier and thought I could just be imagining it As time went on it became very dark 8 to eight and a half feet due to the limited light cast by my headlights I could only see a large dark shape and little or no features At first I thought Bigfoot, having heard wood knocking on the internet; I immediately looked at the road ahead to see if it was up, down or level I GOT OUT TO LOOK OVER THE EDGE WHEN I NOTICED A LARGE HUMAN-LIKE FOOT PRINT I have lived on the Warm Springs Indian Reservation all of my life, and I have had three 'run ins' with Bigfoot I could not honestly tell if it was Bigfoot or a man but from where I saw him he was walking past a pull trailer and he stood with his shoulders well above the top  I looked at it as I drove by, and noticed that it appeared to be covered by long hair, or a long fur-like coat, which was covered/streaked with snow Long arms and legs, with each appendage not having any parts out of proportion with the other parts of the same appendage  As we came around a curve near milepost 36, I saw something dark between the rails I stood there and watched to see what was next, trying to act brave, and stood for about 30 seconds and thought- hell I don't really care what's next, I just wanted out, this ain't gonna be the day I investigate Bigfoot, I actually said to myself -  maybe I'd comeback some other day Found footprints in the snow very much like a very large, bare, human foot Hood National Forest, and after dark, we were sitting around the fire when my daughter tried doing a bigfoot howl I didn't see any thing but  there was an enormous two or three steps traveling away from us and I could feel the vibration of the weight of the steps under my own feet It was blondish-brown in color, had bright yellowish-red eyes and was not as mean looking as some have told in the TV shows that try to scare you about it  I have heard many others speak of these beings in events which happened on farms and ranches, or to hunters in the mountains and wilderness of the southern Oregon and northern California areas It had a good build (well proportioned)The hair seemed to be about four inches long and covered all the body except for the eyes that's when I saw a large animal take off and run about 50 feet beyond the elk We never thought that it might have been a Bigfoot until recently, when we found out about www.bfro.net and heard the 1994 Ohio Field Recordings from Columbiana County (WAV Format, 1350 KB) Once back on the trail, my cousin emerged about 50 feet from me I also noticed that under the eyes seemed to be shiny  We both looked at each other, knew what the other was thinking....BIG FOOT!  We quickly and quietly got back in the car and got out of Dodge I didn't tell him what to look for or what I was seeing for fear of him thinking we were pulling a joke or that we were totally out of  our minds After the creature moved across the road to the trees on the right side, we both looked at each other and said ""No way!"" with very wide eyes There were no footprints anywhere  We had a meeting around a big campfire when it got dark, we ate dinner and then the leaders decided to take us on a snip hunt; We thought that maybe this had driven these bigfoots down low in search of food I didn't see anything at all but when I got back to camp, my mom, her boyfriend and my little brother said that my little brother saw something orange in color walking on two legs, following me still light, but darkness was closing in and fine details are harder to see It had to be very strong because wen I came walking by, it stood up on two legs very fast and grabbed on to the tree behind it to help it up the hill It was about 50 feet away back in the tree line on the other side of the cabin, about 15 feet away from Wes' mom's truck Then I knew something wasn't right, it had big hair & long arms The best way to describe the color was dark brown to black and I would guess the hair to be 4 or 5 inches I followed them back to the job and completed the installation The stories we had heard is, that the Dallas and Falls City area from old timers, and hunter friends of ours, stories of BIGFOOT circulated during that time.. The approach of the creature along the ridge top was shown by half footprints, 8-9” wide, with a step length of about 5’4”, in a straight line without stradle  I realized that the creatures might indeed be bigfoots and I wasn’t sure what might happen if I left the car and gave the appearance of chasing them  I was a bit more uneasy with how the bigfoot was moving and acting No one did, so I never mentioned the rocks, and footsteps I looked where her eyes were looking and maybe 50 yds away or so this huge hairy man took one step towards us, maybe he was just walking, then turned 180 deg and walked away as if he cared less I knew that this Bigfoot probably had some family somewhere in the vicinity, say 1/4 to 1/2 mile of where we were Whatever it was, was very strong and very very surefooted This thing I saw almost looked like a monkey except way too tall to be a monkey and also way to skinny to be a bear and too fast. The hair covered his body and appeared short THE HAIR COLOR WAS A LIGHTER SHADE OF RED AND SPARSE The trailer was parked on the pavement so there was no way to know if there was foot prints anywhere  It walked about 20 seconds and maybe 150 feet directly in our view before it stepped up on a 4 foot tall bank, parted the brush and entered the forest He just remembers it was covered in hair, black, and had red eyes As I came down into a saddle where there were about 3"" diameter saplings on both sides of the ridge, the path in front was clear on top for a long ways and about 30 feet wide 8ft tall) After speaking with others who have had experiences in the woods, I strongly feel that I encountered a Bigfoot that evening. AT THE STOP SIGN JUST BEFORE I TURNED, I HAPPENED TO LOOK UP THE HILL ACROSS FROM THE SIGN AND SPOTTED THE BIGFOOT The bear's legs being shorter, the knees bent much closer to the ground and not much above the foot; what I saw was a foot bending at the ankle, but no bend above that I started to notice hair all over, and started to make out the face  that is when I came to the conclusion that it must have been a big foot as it walked it swung its arms but they were so that the palms of the hand was clearly to the rear and much nearer the knees as opposed to the hip as mine are Several years ago while hunting in southern Oregon on top of Wagner peak just southwest of Ashland Oregon, My father and I happened across A very large almost humon type track in the snow , it appeared to be 14 to 18 inches long ,6 or maybe 7 inches wide , the snow had been melting but it was no humon footprint , there were five distintive toes , and what looked like another heal print about 4 or 5 feet ahead of the other All was quiet for about 3 minutes and somewhere in the dark across the lake we heard something very, very large and strong tussle successfully with a dog Its legs turned out in a peculiar manner during each step but each footfall was set exactly in line with the preceding foot, a detail verified later in daylight During the walking and standing phase, light was always visible between its long legs which were rather slender in front view, but thicker when seen from the side  He said that the creature was 7 to 7 ½ feet tall Part of my job as dorm leader was to look into things like this so I followed them to their bunks and lockers where I got one - I forget his name - to admit that they were outback smoking on the football field when something scared the hell out of them  He looked up at me suddenly, and his eyes asked the same thing I was feeling The vivid picture of a sandy colored figure standing near the surf waving its arms still stays with me today nearly thirty years later.  We then observed little clumps of snow rolling down the 8 foot embankment to our right  Then we heard heavy footsteps Then I heard the dog bark and I turned my head and looked back and all I saw was a 7-8 foot tall black streak running down the hill Now I don't even know if I believe in bigfoot, but what I heard sounds like what you people believe to be a true recording of one Well, we did kinda discuss it being Bigfoot, but jokingly It has deep boulder-studded pools with clean, gray gravel bars often shaded by tall, wet green trees My first introduction to Big Foot was about 1965 I have been interested in Sasquatch/Bigfoot since I was a small boy growing up in Central Oregon hearing stories from my uncles and their friends about the goings on in Northern California in the 50s' and 60s'  The stump it walked behind was about 6.5 feet tall A guy( a Bigfoot researcher maybe??) had audio of Bigfoot just after seeing it Then I moved to the middle and didn't take my eyes off of it  It sounded very heavy, the footsteps could be heard cleary It didn't lumber side to side like a bear does when it stands on its hind legs I glanced down the clear cut just as something large, dark and upright moved across from left to right We were on our way to Seattle when in the woods my father saw what was a tall figure standing straight  She said that it had reddish brown fur, was moving on two legs  I had seen the Patterson/Gimlin film a few years earlier but had mentally thrown it into a category of “don’t believe until there is more evidence” She was living in her cabin in the forest when one night she saw a bigfoot peering at her through the window There are no lights around the house and no moon, so it was pretty dark out there I still don't know about there being a bigfoot but I cannot explain what I know I saw that day My mom said she had never seen him that scared before and her boyfriend was out going to the bathroom and when he walked back to camp my little brother saw the top of his head through the trailer window and he had long hair and she said my brother freaked out and said that it was coming to get him On the porch, there was a small bigfoot standing directly in front of the door, and it was jumping off the porch, then it would jump back up and my daughter would giggle and jump up and down I don't wanna disclose that actual location because of potential bigfoot killers I slowly turned it to the direction of the smell, about 20 feet away across the haulback drum were those eyes again, but now I could make out the shape of a large animal, Black in color and very wide  One day I was hiking cross-country up the hillside up from my cabin when I came upon some extremely large, flat-footed footprints in the soft dirt of the Ponderosa Pine forest Chairs, broken metal, I might add, and the table broken like someone had hit it in the middle of it and broke it  The distance between the foot steps was at least four feet and that was on a steep uphill walk We followed the prints which went up a five foot embankment and disappeared I could sort of see the track they took and I figured the stride to be about 6 feet between prints AT A CLOSER LOOK WE DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS A HAIR OF SOME SORT WITHIN THE PRINT I did noticed an odor like burnt hair and decomposing meat It was only about 150 to 200 feet away from him on the same side of the lake  I drove to within maybe 50 feet of the Tree Both of us became ""Bigfoot"" believers after that day ! So I headed out across the football field, being the brave fool I was I am no expert with regards to Bigfoot and would love to hear your thoughts on this matter and would very much enjoy putting you in contact with all involved and giving you the audio we recorded  AS WE WALKED UP THE RIVER WE SAW THEM ABOUT EVERY 200 FEET My experiences with bigfoot were put on hold for several years after that since I went to college and joined the Army in 1971  At least, to the attendant, it looked like hair  My first experience with bigfoot came in early 1966 a mile further down the road that we realized what it must have been we had no other explaination for the size, shape or huge stride of this creature. Let me also add that I had no desire to have any kind of Bigfoot encounter because I'm on a bike, I'm alone, I carry no weapon for defense, I'm often camping miles from anywhere, and I scare easily The flames were probably 6 feet tall The uniform walking on the front part of the foot suggests that the animal was using a “stealth” walking, undoubtedly having detected the observer early on as she had seen its approach  I did NOT believe in Bigfoot I went to where I last saw it I concluded it was aprox 8 ft tall from a tree it had stood next to when it stopped to look our way It was dark in color, dark brown to almost black The Radio was to be installed on a yarder I believe that it came from the top of the 30 foot tall mud bank we were heading towards The next morning we went to the same spot and about an hour into the hunt we came across a large foot print in a cow pie all the print was there except the toes which were off the cow pie it was then that we come to the conclusion that we must have heard the day before whatever left this foot print.The track was about 12 inches without the toes and around 6 inches wide. The stride didn't appear to shorten as it went up the bank, it just went up 2 of my strides=6 feet  I can sense when a man is near, a deer, an elk, a bear....and a big foot We had all got in our spots with the tent about 15 feet from the trailer Not wanting to have an encounter at that hour with anybody, she retreated below the ridgeline and sat down in a concealed and dark hollow with her dog Well about a half a mile up I saw a track, with very decerable toes (5) and I put my foot up nxt to the print, I am a size 12 and the print was about the same After swinging to my right still on my haunches, I had a clear view of the legs running to know it was on two legs with brown smooth looking fur  The figures walked in a hunched-over posture, one right in front of the other, arms swinging like apes, and taking very long strides  It was near the top, very dark brown or black in color and was crashing down the embankment through some smaller trees, in an upright position This macine is bolted down on two logs that are about three feet in diameter and fifty feet long.I estimate the weight of this machine to be 45 tons I searched the area for about 2 hours, hair samples on trees, scat, or other prints in area...negative results...photos of area were taken from different perspective points The prints were huge, at least 18 to 20 inches long and when you put your hand down in the print you could feel where the toes and ball of the foot were One of the camp leaders was showing off some footprints he claimed to have found by the river that morning and cast, then obliterated them to prevent distractions I could hear it crashing through the brush on two legs They were huge human like footprints, about 1-1/2 times longer than my boots (size 10-1/2) and were spaced farther apart than a human gait Then the scale of the figure really struck me; it had to be a good 8 feet tall or more  I am involved in ongoing research in the Salmonberry area, so my eyes are always scanning There was hair around the trees also but no one thought to gather; it reddish in colour, about three inches long Let me just start by saying I'm recently a believer in Bigfoot I was traveling on a very straight section of 138 East of the pass when I saw a large very dark humanoid figure appear out of the woods and very quickly run (great strides) across the roadway and disappear into the woods to the south before I could get even to it Woke to hear foot steps outside tent heading to truck, something rustled around in the truck, thought it was my son HE WAS ABOUT FIFTY FEET FROM ME SLIGHTLY UP THE HILL  Ex: Dark features that kind resembled eyes and arms coming across a leg Nov 13th, 2006: 9:00 pm, dark, rainy and cold Then I noticed its entire silhoutte was covered with hair, not just the head All appendages moved at the same time, head turning, legs moving, arms moving, all with the same fluidity  I NEVER THOUGGHT MUCH ABOUT BIG FOOT  They responded that they had no personal experience of bigfoot, they didn’t know what was in California, but even if bigfoots existed in California, that they didn’t believe bigfoots existed in Oregon  We plucked up our courage and continued on up the road following the foot prints  I had never heard any mention of Bigfoot sightings in that region before that but went to the library and found out indeed there had been some We found an easy dozen or more footprints in the water in the mud..  The funny thing was, the print looked like the foot was broken and healed wrong, I do know that it was not human and it deffinatly was not any type of animal I hunt for I DO NOT BELIEVE ANY HUNTER OR OUTDOORSMAN MADE THE HUT AND SURELY NOT THE FOOTPRINTS.  The arms were in proportion, not long and dangly.  As I look back on it now, I realized that IF it was a bigfoot, its curiosity was simply that....curiosity My older brother and I were messing around in the creek below the ghost town and we looked up to see bigfoot running up the creek Finally I was asleep, only to be awakened to footsteps outside our camp I've always been a non-believer of bigfoot, but now I'm convinced At first I thought there must be an accident or stalled vehicle ahead (there were none behind me that I had passed), because why would someone be standing/sitting in that location, watching traffic?  I was puzzled by what I saw, and noticed there were no vehicles stalled/parked below the location, either Bigfoot crossed the road in front of us while we were on Hwy 6 Between I-5 and the coast only what I can describe as a long leg and foot disappearing up the hillside into the trees and brush the soil was very dark and rich  Sure enough there were several big prints in the soft earth about 5 feet from the fire It was about 300 feet from me and I pulled my rifle up on it to see it with the scope and was able to follow it just long enough to see that it looked to be dark brownish with what looked to be possible moss on it  I had a really strong feeling that I was being watched; every hair on my body was rigid, I had goose bumps over my whole body I have them now as I write about this, not as bad but the chills I thought at first, it might be a bear that has been losing its hair I base this on the fact that I drive a Dodge Ram truck; when I'm sitting in the driver's seat, my head is 6 feet off the ground For 2 nights in a row they heard possible big foot calls that went on for 20min the first night and about 3 min the next night The datetime can be better established because when i got home and was telling my wife, she said that the previous weekend some guy had taken videos of bigfoot at Hoodo spring some twenty miles from where i was at and they had been on the news  One of my hunting partners even shot a 6x6 bull within 50 yards of where I saw and watched the Bigfoot, he shot it the previous year  A few days later back in Portland, OR the news said that there had been a report of a Bigfoot in that area  There at the far end of the culvert were 2 ape-like creatures with glowing eyes In it were several foot prints from what looked like elk and bear  I could take you to the exact spot where that Bigfoot was When I got to the middle of the hill,  the hair on the back of my neck stood up and I got goose bumps I could see it's arms swinging as it walked and seemed to have a pointed or conical shaped head  I believe the sound came from the vegetation / trees at the bottom of the ravine, which we had been within 30 feet of when gathering downed wood but when it got up and started walking it looked like a tall human-grizzly IT WAS VERY DARK BROWN AND HAD A BLONDISH COLORED TIP  My friend looked at me and said I will bet these are big foot tracks;  I said it could not be, not this close to civilization, especially since down the hill to our left about three quarters of a mile were some secluded homes on the Southern edge of Ashland Out the back window --- I saw a bigfoot looking at me!! --- I said hello (to him?) but he just turned away and went out toward the field THERE WERE SOME LARGE FOOTPRINTS ABOUT 18 INCHES LONG WITH A STRIDE OF ABOUT 4 - 5 FEET  It was very dark  outside I saw 2 sets of Bigfoot tracks on the north end of Cape Blanco Beach August 14, 1986, approximately 7:30 a.m. Several things I noticed about the print, 1) It was not a boot print as no boot tracks were showing, the print was smooth, consistent with a bare foot print I'VE GONE BACK TO THE SAME SPOT SINCE THEN LOOKING TO SEE IF THERE IS ANYTHING I COULD HAVER MISTAKEN FOR A BIGFOOT Then I noticed some motion about fifty feet to the right of the tree and thought I could see a face looking at me Its arms were longer than a man's but it didn't look like a gorilla with arms too long for its body  I walked down the dark hallway, and came around the corner and I was about to tell Diane that it was too late to be playing around, when I saw why she was giggling  Then I saw what I assumed to be the mother bigfoot walk by the window  The Bigfoot was reaching with his arms and picking foliage up, and I presume it was eating it The creature was dark brown, almost black, and hairy, like an ape, but bipedal like a human My cousin refused to believe it was something like bigfoot although he knew it was no bear  The early spring of 1976 I was living in a small log cabin on the banks of Tumalo Creek approx 10 miles into the foothills of the Central Oregon Cascades outside of Bend, Oregon  He looked at me and said that I heard bigfoot While collecting mushrooms i came across a huge footprint This road is narrow, sandy, and winds out through the 10' tall manzanita brush  There is honestly no other explanation for this type of call and activity, though we understand how rare and extraordinary this must be because we live in a settled area near freeways and quite honestly we've never really considered ""bigfoot"" before much more than ""what a neat theory!"" Let me just state again that this was not human It was about 7-1/2 to 8 feet tall, covered in hair,  very broad in the shoulder and across the chest At first glance I thought it was a person because it stood upright and walked on two legs however as it stode acroos the highway its gate was slightly hurried and it only took two massive strides to reach the other side of the road During the early 70's I had three other encounters in the Wolf Creek area where I heard something inexplicable and had the same sensation of panic and hair actually raising on the back of my neck  Wes said that as we were driving off, something ran across the road behind us on two legs It ran like a man, much too agile to be a bear, and completely upright, swinging its arms in front of it as it ran to move the heavy brush out of its way I was shaking and scared and the hair was standing up on the back of my neck! I could not get up the courage to get up and look out the window I saw eyes looking directly at me But when I discovered the hill was an easy 10 foot high, I really became fearful and decided to return to my car and leave instead of following the tracks into the grass tall They appeared to be about 15 inches long with the same 6 foot stride From about thirty, maybe forty feet away, I noticed what appeared to be a tall stump or object standing on the other side of the tree  I could hear his every foot step Then for about two seconds from a distance of about a hundred feet I could clearly see what looked like a large guerrilla running up the hill His horse became nervous but he forced it on and found a very large  hairy animal chewing on the live cow What struck meas  odd was the fact that these were very deep (about 6-8 inches), very long (about 18 inches) and the stride was very long; I had to leap into each one A  little  farther along  my  wife  said,""some  one  is  up  here  walking  bare  foot."" We  followed  the  track  and  it  was  smoking fresh,  the  water was  just  starting  to  form  in  the  tracks  At 65 mph, I didn't see it for long, especially at night; however, there is no doubt that it was the stereotypical bigfoot I had never heard of Bigfoot, read anything about him or had any idea what so ever that such things existed in the woods My feet wouldn't move and as the fog moved away, it was about the same distance away, looking at us It had no antlers, and as I got closer I saw that it didn't have hind legs or a horizontal body attached As we first hit the trail,  I should mention we both herd a howl the likes of nothing I have never heard before in my LIFE, the hair on the back of my neck stood on end, even my fiance said that it was the wierdest thing she ever heard   my hair still stands with the thought ...my friend and i will never forget The observer now also noticed that the creature was evidently naked by its silhouetted legs clearly outlined up to its crotch After some time, after the creature had held its hands again to its head (ears), it suddenly dropped low down and then launched itself with a powerful push-off off the side of the ridge, about 10' high, into an instant high-speed run, in which it covered 95’ to concealment in three 30’ steps, with the legs straight out in front and back, giving the impression of a different hip articulation than that of man There was a structure about ten foot deep by about fifteen feet wide, nothing more than trees lashed to the standing trees to make a full roof basically at a slight angle to shed water to the back About two feet behind the tailgate of my friend's moms truck, was crouched not one, but two of what appeared to be smaller bigfoots  The footings are cement  Our tent is about 7 feet high when set up and the grunts sounded about a foot or two higher than the tent and about 6 feet away It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up  When he came back with coffee, the attendant asked how the hood on the car had gotten such a huge dent right in the middle and he wondered what all the hair around the edge of the hood was It was very dark in color  It had dark colored eyes None of our group particularly believe in Bigfoot but do not totally rule it out  Between the bottom of the clay and edge of the water was a rock shelf with the boulders lying on it, about 20-30 feet wide We noticed the person was very large and seemed to be as tall as we were on the bluff AT THE FORK I NOTICED A DARK AREA IN A BRUSH PILE Before I go any further, I'd like to emphasize that I am not sure that I actually heard a bigfoot sound  Big foot lives in the Siskiyous, not the Cascades The creature was running fast, upright, very hairy, humanoid in appearance, and estimated to be 7 feet tall (definitely larger than the witness who is 6’3”)  Most of the area between the island and the shore was maybe 5 or 6 feet deep up to within about 50 feet of the shore where there was about a foot  of water over soft mud I followed the animals' route several days later for about 20 yards after it disappeared and found a faint footprint  I estimate that it was about 8 ft tall  It was too far away to identify the features of the face, but we could tell the top of the head was covered with hair and there was a mane of heavier hair on it's back and shoulders It wasn't very loud but I could make out actual footsteps I saw a very tall, shaggy golden brown animal with two very long legs When looking in the only areas something could go, I saw it walking very fast, long arms swinging, one basic black color  I whistled and made attempts to make the Bigfoot turn and look at me The things that I did notice were it was very hairy, ran on 2 legs and had long arms  He was taking pictures from our south-facing window (no screen) that looks out over a beautiful orchard landscape in the Hood River Valley that leads up to the foot of Mount Hood When we heard(me, mother,father, 4 brothers, 1 sister and a friend) all heard a loud hair raising scream some what like that of a pterodactyl dinosaur  I didn't see it this time, but our dogs were barking up a storm, and I remember my Mexican husband (not believing in Bigfoot) telling me that it was only the cattle or horses that wander around the area The shape was like a human however it was extreamly tall approx  I briefly wondered if they might be military men on some sort of a training mission, but quickly discarded the idea because while military people sometimes dress in uniform dark colors, they always carry a lot of gear – weapons, ammo, food, radios, helmets, etc – and these creatures were not carrying anything  HE SAID BIG FOOT DOES THAT However, I found some other prints that were bigger than the original, and some impressions that were smaller than my own foot (a youngster?) My husband remarked, ""If that was bigfoot I don't know how he moved that quickly!"" I told him that we could rule out trail workers and that it was quite possible that it was TWO bigfoot communicating with each other  What this Bigfoot did next amazed me, it put one of its big hands on the upper part of the alder I looked up and saw something big and hairy step from tree to tree I stopped with it in my headlights and it stopped right in front of me as I almost hit it (about 2 feet from it) and sat and watched it stare at me through the windshield The arms looked to come down to mid thigh area His arm length was to his knees, his height at 8 or better ft tall  Then it proceeded to swing it's legs over the alder and sit down on the alder like you or I would sit on a fence rail I watched it and decided after a minute or so it was not a deer or elk and decided maybe a old tree stump with the top broken off about 5 feet tall  He suggested I had seen a bigfoot You played a recording of a bigfoot and when we heard it it sent goosebumps over my skin and my hair stood up again and so did my wife's  I still wonder if this was a bigfoot, how or why it would have been near a town, but I have no other explanations and hairy What I saw was a thing about 6 foot tall, all black and short hair, its body was skinny and its forearms were bigger than its biceps paw  marks, because  all  that  we  saw  were  the  hind  feet  marks  in  the  snow I only walked about 20 feet past the saplings, and stood on a log for a better view, but did not see anything moving At this point, ""undetermined what made the print"" At his point only two other Bigfoot Research Websites have been contacted on this sighting, no response as of yet Several times I lost my feet and rolled and dove through ferns, trees and thorny bushes  It looked like a flat-footed human print complete with 5 toes but it was approximately 16-18 inches long  He said bigfoot lives all over the mountains in Oregon and was not just confined to one or two areas And covered in hair I was just browsing Google earth tonight and clicked on some place marks that turned out to be links to your big foot sighting page I would estimate the figure was in excess of 6 feet tall and had no distinguishable clothing.  I guestimated the stride at 6-1/2 feet using the 8-1/2 foot length of the rod An update from John (12/20/02)--I went around the place and did find a footprint on the bank behind the house At a far distance of 80 yards or so, this thing was taller then me, at a level field The road started to bend south a bit and we came to the first incline and in the headlights of my truck appeared this figure, at first I thought it was some animal that was crossing the road but as we got closer and the lights of the truck became more focused on it, we realized that it was not a common anima! It looked to be about three to four feet tall with the strangest red colored hair covering it's body Being volcanic ground (pumice) I would fish from several feet away then slowly work my way to the creek side I COULD SEE THE MUSCLES BENEATH THE HAIR But then it moved about two feet to the left I'm guessing 5 feet tall; there was no smell as the breeze was in my face while it was directly in front of me I would like to begin saying I saw saw a phone number a couple years ago that went 1800 big foot  It was not until I got out of the Army in 1977 and returned to Oregon that my destiny seemed to bring bigfoot back into my life I had to be 8 or 10 feet away at the time It was much darker than the foliage, moving and so it stood out a large biped with unusually long seeming arms walked across the clearing heading away and upslope at an unhurried pace I never used to believe in hairy people before I saw it myself The hand was huge with long reddish brown hair Then I saw an animal about five feet off the trail, in the brush, approximatly 10 yards away from us, in the direction we had come from Not more than 3 or 4 steps down the trail we hear a rustle noise and I quickly turned to see a rock or something rather large, dark and round fall to the ground with a large THUMP! The item had landed just where I was standing only a moment before We left Vancouver in the late afternoon, and made our way down the highway that runs parallel to the Columbia River (I can not remember the # of the road) just after dark we aproached (what the sign said was) the Columbia River Gorge(seeing as how it was dark we did not see much)  The hair was dark brown, long on the arms, but shorter and more sparse on the chest  It blinked its eyes, but it was like the animal was frozen with its eyes set on me  Also  we found footprints on top of the mountain several months later that I photographed but I did not measure properly for which I kick myself for being so stupid 52' 24"" W at an elevation of about 3,300 feet I am convinced that this was a bigfoot A search for footprints with flashlights was unsuccessful for finding clues or footprints  What ever it was, it had hit the tower, with its arms, hands, body...but no implements like a log, or a rock, since there were no indents in the wooded leg of the tower For several months I've been reading the case histories on the BFRO website, and frankly, I knew that the areas I'd be riding in were prime Bigfoot country It was about 50 feet away We spent 3 weeks in the state and I was lucky enough to see what I think was Bigfoot at that time and it was far taller than me The brush stood 4' tall and extended off the road 20 feet  As we got into our sleeping bags, my friend made the remark that he hoped no bigfoot(s) would bother us The color was very dark brown, it's arms at its sides, it just stood there loking as we drove by Its' arms were hugging its' sides  We guessed that accounting for the slope and difference in our elevation from the creature, that it might have been about 8 or 8.5 feet tall, because about 1/3 of its body was above the stump from our view Creature 7 to 8 feet tall was sighted by my wife and son at  9:15 pm 01/09/02 near Multnomah Falls  It did not run, but moved fairly quickly with long strides The creek was not very wide, and I was standing more or less in the middle of it, straddling the stream with each foot on a rock and facing upstream, with the trail to my left (more or less west) and the wooded hillside on my immediate right  They had been on the plateau, and he assumed it was a horse standing facing them, so that it appeared to two legs only - until it turned sideways and walked very fast away from them At that point I realized I had just walked up to Bigfoot  Occasionally I would have a human visitor but most  of the time, I was totally and completely alone Its legs didn't look all that long, but it had knees, and it ran like a man, but extremely fast with 2-3 inches on the front left and 2 inches on the back so we are talking about a foot like Shaquille O'Neal Thia was a real life sighting  of BIGFOOT in the daylight, no obstruction from 25 yrds  He then told me a story, about a big foot that allegedly lives up near Scott Mountain, or Mt Scott away was this upright dark haired creature standing there looking at me At first we thought they were bears, but no bears walk upright in perfect stride He was of a darker color brown We saw dark brown fur up against the mesh and the scratching was once again above us I was a witness to something large, tall and running on two legs, not four....thinking it may have been a bear, or a crazed hunter dressed in black.. It was a hairy thing running from the treeline into the clearcut on two legs I couldn't imagine how anyone could walk barefooted in that area We had decided to go for about 20 minutes and then return back figuring to return to the car around dark I kept walking in terror, when all of the sudden about 30 feet off to my right, I heard a loud thumping sound crash out I installed many more radio systems after this and many were at night, but never saw or herd any thing again. I just really feel as though it could have been ""Bigfoot"". It should be added at this juncture that during the entire approach, the creature walked on the anterior half of the foot with a 5’ pace, as ascertained by inspection on the next day In the morning we went and looked in the area closest to the house and found want could 2 possible tracks, they matched nothing we had ever seen, and we compared them with the other animal tracks in the area and they matched nothing, also noticed that the grass was pushed down in approx 3-4 foot strides running through the field behind the stream area where we found the possible tracks and where we thought some the noises were coming from I couldn't believe I was really seeing this footprint, so I called my husband over to verify it I could see the big flat foot, the toes and heel There was a fallen tree about a hundred and fifty feet up the hill and it began to rock up and down at a uniform rate of about 1 HZ About 5 minutes up the road I noticed about half way up a hill was a large rock outcropping with a black stump about 9 feet tall  There was about a 3-4 inch difference in foot size  I then explained my curiosity about big foot At first when I saw the eyes I thought it was an owl Five toes and I would estimate that it was larger than Shaq's foot by a long shot We were just lying there with the window open staring into the dark  Right at the point of curve, of the turn to the south, right next to the guard rail, was a bigfoot It was big and hairy No moon and very dark! Around 22:30 hrs the hair stood up on the back of my neck They wanted to see, so I had to let my mom out, so we looked at them together and found footprints in the sandy dirt roughly the size of a mans It stood up and ran off on two legs She also said that its eyes seemed as if they had the knowledge of the all the world in them I then decided if I was going to see Bigfoot, then by god, I'm gonna try to get a good look!! I was parked in such a way that I had to pull way out and swing the front end around for my lights to hit them directly Near the end of August, this year 2008 a couple of friends and I went camping/Bigfoot hunting around the upper Collawash River in the Oregon Cascade Range east of Estacada with the intensions of finding a spot I had been told about by a guide on a whitewater rafting trip I had taken with my brother in 2006 I took a look around for footprints, but with all of the limbs and brush I was not able to find any My mother (T.G.) and my aunt and my two uncles were driving over Emigrant Pass by Pendleton OR when they decided to stop and stretch their legs  I clearly sas the head, shoulder, arm, and upper torso of a very tall creature standing upright and melting into the trees I thought at first it might be another hunter, but dismissed that thought when I thought about the fact that it was all dark colored and didn't appear to be carrying or packing anything I described the color of the hair and I was told that it must have been black hair that I had seen, because this area only had black bears  The terrain constrained both foot and vehicular traffic to follow the ridgeline My observation of what I saw was a 7-8 foot tall, hairy creature running almost full throttle  We know what it was now--a female BIGFOOT!!!! I am 16 years of age,and it is 4:27 and about an hour ago i was mowing a friend of the familys lawn and kept noticeing these rocks being thrown at me and so i thought that the weed eater was hitting these rocks and didn't think much and it, well about two mins later i could smell this awful B.O smell and thinking i must really have bad B.O, so i checked and i couldn't smell anything and the rocks started to come back at me again but this time i could hear laughter but like a retarded person so i keep looking around to see if anyone was around messing with me, AND NOBODY WAS THERE so i just kept mowing and smelling that awful smell and then the rocks started being thrown at me and i looked over in the woods and trees and saw this huge creature behind a tree and my hair went strait up on end and i ran like a bat out of hell and when i got to the door i looked back and it was running through the trees and the trees and bushes were moving fast like in Jurassic Park and i know it wasn't a bear it was too tall and no bear can run that fast on two legs if they can run on two legs at all I also had friend that moved from Michigan that he and his folks seen one standing in the middle of the road one night, described it as a large hair covered creature that looked like a man, he referred to it as a bigfoot  I could see the full length of his arms, the size of his entire body  Why would someone be there?  Except for the interstate, this spot is fairly isolated; farms/ranches are quite a long distance away  I know exactly what I saw and I know Bigfoot exists because I have seen one running like the wind.  The weird sensation of being watched was coming from a point about half-way up that hillside, probably 40 feet from the stream I wasn't going to report this incident, but I believe it is of major importance to the Bigfoot research community It's an old logging unit with trees about 10-12 feet tall This thing stayed on 2 legs and never went down on all fours The dog was shivering violently at this time, when the observer decided to show herself on top of the ridge behind her, where she stood for a moment waving her walking stick demonstratively in the air, while the dog pressed against her legs A group of us was out back above the football field at night partying with the full moon I don't think I have ever seen any bipedal thing that tall... He ran so fast, my mind wasn't sure my eyes had seen what they thought they did Black hair from head to torso then a reddish cinnamon hair color from torso to waist It was taller than an elk and much, much taller than a white tail deer At first I thought who was that lady at that time of day?, I assumed at that time because I saw long dark brown reddish hair lit by the setting sun behind her We didn't smell anything, we didn't see footprints...but I can't think of anything else that would explain these noises and the rock being thrown at us   I had heard the Klamath audio before and this made my hair stand on end because it was exactly the same  I had almost forgotten why I went up there in the first place and that was to satisfy my couriosity about possible bigfoot activity I judged it to be well over 6 feet tall We came across a large stump that had some kind of hair all over it I wasn’t totally convinced that these creatures existed and did not think I would find anything about them because I figured that if there were encounters, they were very rare  The hair on our necks was standing up and we both got the creeps This clear cut was about seventy-five yards wide and was covered with light colored grass about knee high (2 feet) I turned my head and all I remember seeing was a very large dark person (It walked like a human) WE COLLECTED THE HAIR AND PUT IT IN A FILM CONTAINER The creatures I saw were definitely humanoid in shape – head, torso, two legs, two arms We also noticed the person almost seemed totally uninterested in our presence and looked like it was looking for something on the beach, stopping occasionally and starting up again The width of the foot would indicate a foot length of between 18” and 20”, in turn commensurate with a height above 8’, in congruence with the observer’s estimate It was dark brown or black and uniform in color and at least 8ft to 9ft tall and moving like a freight train, it was huge! We only saw it for maybe a second before it tore into the trees running from the right to the left The only sign of wildlife was foot long slugs  It was the kind of ""being watched"" that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up We were positive it was bigfoot At that moment we knew it was like nothing any of us ever heard before so when we arrived home searching for the sounds of cougars mountain lions and bigfoot as well we finally came accross your site and knew positively that it was bigfoot The saplings on each side of this ridge had leaves still on so you could only see throught them to about three feet up I hadn't seen any sign of Bigfoot, but had a great trip exploring some beautiful country We studied this for some time trying to figure out what had happened there as the stump had hair all over it and it was also all over the ground For years I only said I saw a hairy man...but it was a bigfoot.  The brush, manzanita, was anywhere from 2 - 6 foot high, and very densely packed  What I observed was a massive hairy man-like animal standing next to a large tree (I think it was a cedar)  This gentle old Indian man said that the sight came as such a surprise that all the men went over backwards on the logs they were sitting on, as this bigfoot came hard charging after the deer, right through the fire, swinging this club at the deer, totally ignoring the Indians sitting there  My wife and I agreed it was critical to get my family off that mountain to safety before dark, so we did not stop At this point we were all convinced that these were bigfoot tracks. To be more specific, the hair was black and flowing from head to waist We were paddle boarding at Hosmer Lake and on the far backside of the lake where the water is only about 1 foot deep we saw a track or trail through the water with very clear and apparent large footprints I searched all around in the forest and on the other side of the highway for tracks, but could not find anything that was clearly a bigfoot track Also we saw foot prints that were at least 18 inches long and as wide as my foot.(I wear a 6 1/2) My hair was standing on end and I yelled at my daughter to ""RUN""!!! I didn't even look back to make sure my daughter was behind me, I figured I could hear her footsteps and that was good enough  Being behind the mountain away from the sun, it was sort of dark, more like twilight It looked like a large hairy man kinda brownish with dark streaks and patches on the shoulders and hips and legs.It moved so quickly , it was there one second gone the next My roommate and I were driving along Hwy 224 between Carver and Barton at approximately 10pm when I saw a pair of eyes reflecting in the darkness on the river side of the road  I had forgotten all about bigfoot by this time  In June of 1995, an interest feature on Bigfoot in the Oregonian newspaper described ""tree whacking"" as a communication medium of Bigfoot creatures  Instantly I had these simultaneous impressions:  this large round head with brownish hair (features were indistinct due to the angle of the sun) moved like an animal, not a human, the hair was standing up on the back of my neck; and I felt panic along with a need to flee He said it had dark fur all over and it was pretty large...but then again he was very small! When I asked him about this story today to get the details, he said that during the 3 or 4 months they lived there that year he heard loud screeching, howling noises once in awhile that he didn't recognize to be any animal he had ever heard.  Nearly every little diner and gas station seemed to have ""bigfoot"" plaster casts on the wall that ""were found 1 mile from here.""  I thought it was all a big joke intended to boost tourism 8' tall  For the next hour and a half I sat with my bow next to me, the dog sitting between my legs, and listened to many instances of downed branches cracking beyond the saplings  It never came any closer than 20 feet and never made a sound Using the dollar bill we measured a stride of 4 feet  The body was covered with hair but it ran flat footed  The foot was completely decked and toes were clear as day... Well they pulled over and I got out and was in the process of going when I looked down I saw a foot print beside the road, a bare foot, no shoes on She also observed a distinct “sliding” motion of the feet, which she believes was caused by a peculiar sideways swing of the foot and leg The only thing I could see were those eyes staring at me Since that experience I have seen two different ""footprints"" within a 2 mile radius of where I saw the Bigfoot at It had some hair but was not as hairy as a bear Intermittently, she noticed that the hair on the head and shoulders “bristled” and flared out  I looked again to determine if they were a threat to me, and saw they were, in fact, covered in black, and it probably wasn't dark clothing We moved probable only 100 feet before we couldn't go any farther The creature was at least seven feet tall, more like eight feet, as it was a full foot taller than my 4x4 I thought maybe I was a little more tired than I thought and that my eyes were playing tricks on me My first impression was ""THAT is the biggest deer I have ever seen in my life!"" But, even though it was looking directly into the headlights, the eyes were not reflective His father told us of the rancher at the foot of the Capes (Also on Hwy 101) who had been riding to check on his cattle when he heard a cow bellowing in agony I continued following them with the hair on the back of my neck standing up The footprints were not particularly deeply imprinted, in keeping with the rather slender-waisted and thin-legged appearance observed during the night. I looked up the hill and there were branches of trees about 2-4 inches thick and about 3-4 feet long being thrown down the hill at me The hair had a slight wave to it  Do I believe in bigfoot....HELL YES!  Do I understand what they are or where they came from, NOT HARDLY!  I was washing my hair in the creek and looking up between my legs I saw a head peeking over a fallen log about 60 feet up the hill behind me, slightly to my left She said that it must see in the dark because its eyes were lit up like that of a deers in the head lights and that the color of them were blue I first met Ray Crowe at a seminar he did on BIGFOOT in 1994 It was now about 7 pm, about 2 hours until dark 4) The foot print clearly shows a heel print, and arch in the foot, the edge of the foot at wide proportions from a very heavy individual  The footprints were coming up the hillside from the area of my cabin and at first it frightened me to think I was sharing an environment with such a powerful creature The trail lasted approx a couple hundred feet .. From there on, being distorted by my act of running faster than I've ever moved before, I could swear I heard the distinctive two-legged footsteps veering toward me from off the trail between houses This thing came within 100 feet of me and stopped When the fear hit, me my right foot immediately floored the accellerator, not in an attempt to hit the creature but in an attempt to get away from it 3 days after getting home from camping, we were all 3 watching a program on Discovery Channel about Bigfoot I found a book with a black cover and if I am not mistaken, the title was ""Bigfoot"" UNFORTUNATELY WHILE TAKING THE HAIR OUT TO SHOW SOMEONE, IT WAS LOST We both agreed we just saw a Bigfoot but yet part of us just wanted to say no we didn’t!  We talked a little about it and kind of dismissed it having second guessing ourselves I think that the Big Foot was looking at him, when it walked over to the side of the mountain and looked down One of the articles from the Chronical stated that a young bigfoot had been captured in the late 1880's and put in a freak-side show At the exact second we looked out into the darkness, there came a shriek like nothing we had ever heard before  We both realized the hair on our necks were standing up and our skin was crawling While in Pendleton a couple days later I was describing the sounds to a local hunter when an older native woman overheard and said she thinks it was a Bigfoot, and that she’s heard them on the Umatilla Reservation. I was skeptical about Bigfoot before but I try to keep an open mind and had been dark for at least an hour  The moan seemed to come from the line of orchard trees in the shadows about 20 feet from the house along the south edge of the driveway  It smelled like a combination of wet mop and wet dog hair that had moldered for awhile The size of this ""bear"" was frightening, as I and my husband are 6 foot 3 and 6 foot 4 respectively and this animal was much bigger, probably 7 or 8 feet tall at least and very heavily built It was just the front half of the foot and it looked to have just the  ball under the big toe and the big toe and the next two I specifically remember saying lets get the hell outta here I just saw some bigfoot tracks Covered with very dark brown fur It was about two football fields away and was in the video for a very short time At about 5 am and still dark, the other camper left in a hurry in his pickup  I had mentally classified the creatures as “hunters”, but the classification did not fit very well It was covered in fur/hair medium to dark brown After about 20 minutes of poking around, I came across a huge footprint indented about an inch deep in the grassy ground It was not close enough to hear footsteps associated with it As soon as this powerful yell,scream,bellow,??? ended we were on our feet running in the direction we had come from I looked on all the fence posts in the area where I saw it but did not see any evidence of hair Something tall and hairy with long arms got up and ran into the trees and brush they had dark shaggy hair like a bears they were on two legs they swung there arms and stood upright and ran upright Facial features did not have a snout and the arms were too long for a bear's front legs It appeared to have long hair all over; at first I thought it was a long jacket like a duster, but as I look back it had to be fur We were a little scared at seeing what looked to be a very hairy human running up past us Throughout the entire pacing sequence  she could see light through the legs I stopped and watched, I started to think it was just a stump and my eyes and instincts playing with me I was scared to death and spent the night with my gun in my hand laying frozen in my completely dark tent trailer Walking upright with arms bent  The smaller one was about 4-5 feet tall and probably about 100 to 150 pounds I lived in Lincoln City for many years and have spent time in the woods alone and with others and have never felt or seen anything like this  I don’t know what to make of it except for it being Bigfoot I thought it was odd that I didn't feel it, but as soon as that thought crossed my mind a loud scraping sound was followed by a loud thud that came from the thick patch of trees next to my tent, only 2-3 feet away, I heard no other sound after that We left to go on a night hike and followed a trail down the river, very far down the river where we found a great dark spot in thick foliage to sit and have a beer and watch the stars and throw rocks into the river It was waving its arms up and down facing the surf and the tower  I've never seen any thing like it, including bears standing on there rear legs, both black and brown in Alaska.This thing was tall, slimmer than bear  The Bigfoot sat on that alder and his legs were swinging like you or I would swing them on a fence rail I knew then it was a bigfoot that my folks told me about  It was hard to measure since we were not carrying a measuring tape NOR were we expecting anything like THIS!  When we put the heel of our boots next to the toe of the footprint; and stepped off the distance between THE PRINTS it was nearly three paces, or 9 feet   Then, a few days later around Christmas/New Years the local newspaper ran a story about ""Bigfoot"" scaring tribal members and people at night  And the strides were not human either The creature was definitely walking upright and on two legs  I was carrying a .44 magnum pistol with me, and thought about going back up on foot to look for sign, but I was a little rattled at the time, and opted not to The hair on our bodies arose as if we were there again hearing it all over again and the fear over took me and I began to cry again from what we know now was Bigfoot. As the photo shows I took a casting of the footprint, as mentioned, only one was found thus far Unfortunately, I can't recall whether I heard footfalls or not  All I can say is, if it wasn't a bigfoot, fine My Big Foot Sightings over the years   Based on the vegetation and lack of snow, I later estimated the elevation was between 4,000 and 6,000 feet We were interviewed years later by a man named Todd from the Bigfoot Research Institute in The Dalles, OR, and they published our account  Until it was out of my site it remained on that same alder sitting there swinging it's legs THE HAIR WAS ABOUT AN INCH LONG AND WAS VERY CORSE  This was the first time that I had ever experienced the hair standing up on the back of my neck The running board which the operator stands on is around 2 to 21/2 feet above ground level  It had broad shoulders, reddish brown coloured hair, and didn't seem to be in a big hurry gettin to where it was goin I didn't notice any footprints but did see the tall grass had been walked through on the other side of the fence I placed the sound about 20 feet up the bank   My friend looked at me and said the area where we were standing was considered rugged mountains and bigfoot lives in areas like that  He said that Bigfoot have travelled and protected our people for many generations, and they meant no harm to us, if we leave well enough alone It was very big at least 7ft or more tall and it walked kind of stooped over they went through the clearcut faster than any man on two legs could ever go.they then disappeared into the treeline on the other side.this is what i was told This is why I THINK I may have a Bigfoot around  Off to my left was what appeared to be a dead-burned out snag about 8 or 10 feet tall We were both kinda freaked out by what I had heard, so we raised out eyes to the darkness of the woods We also heard ""heavy"" footsteps outside our tent on Saturday night, July 17th  I still had my rifle slung on my back as stopped to view the dark object on the other side of the lone pine tree  Then the creature stepped out into the open about 40 feet away up at the top of the bank  I am mainly putting it on here because I have thought about it in depth (that's why the delay in reporting), and the only thing in my memory that has any resemblance at all to what I've heard is the past audio recordings of bigfoot (although what I heard had better audio!) To our surprise she informed us that no bear was as big as we described, and nor do bears walk on two feet  The only way down would have been to walk my ridge down and it would have crossed the trail Bigfoot was on about 100 yards downhill from where I was I am also a good friend of Lyle Vann of the Arizona Bigfoot Center Paulden, Az. The object was hunched over slightly and was on two legs and cleared the road in about 4 steps I totally expected to look stupid and have her tell me she saw nothing It didn't sound like a bear, because the foot steps were spaced apart longer than a four legged animal  The sparsely located trees on this mountain were, at that time, not much over 16 - 18 feet tall Well, all of a sudden I heard 4 knocks  come from the woods just to my right about 50 feet away, behind a stand of trees and bushes No bear walks on its back legs like this Though it was clear, it appeared to be shadowed from head to foot. I cant tell you how tall it was , I got the profile and it was big Parents went up top the hill and found large foot prints  The ground was nothing but pine needles so it would be hard to make a footprint (I had a very heavy beard/mustache and long hair at this time) the wife's friend is a trained marine like myself and was a nonbeliever until that day and there is no question in there minds they said that was a bigfoot It definitely stood upright like a bipedal animal, and it had pretty long arms with elbow joints I believe I was visited by a bigfoot  By now I had determined that this Bigfoot was not a man, and I had drawn my Remington Model 721 chambered in .270 Winchester on him to see him through my scope, and for extra security The bigfoot, as I said, was the stereotypical bigfoot  IF indeed it was a bigfoot, it simply went between the fire and the tent on its way to somewhere else Before either of us could utter a word, another yell, just like the first, came from behind the Community Kitchen no more that 100 feet from us Now I've seen many shows playing what are supposedly films of bigfoot and how it could be faked On the right hand side of our pasture the river ran along side of it and the hot wire was to the chest of a fifteen hand horse this thing came out of the bottom of the river bed stepped over our hot wire fence and the only way I can describe the walk was like a swinging run because its arms and lags twisted with the run or walk or swing Its back was darker colored than its front I was able to determine it was hairy and resembled a large man (est On our way home after work we debated what the creature was and concluded that it was a bigfoot  I looked out onto my deck, through the windows and I saw those eyes  From the tip of the toes to the heel of the footprint ahead, was about 9 - 10 feet  His eyes were actually drained of all color, much like those of a husky Was it Bigfoot? I have no idea as it did sound somewhat different than the recordings you have on the site It was jet black and had the forward posture with the long swinging arms As to what it looked like, I only got a brief look as I went by, but it had to be at least 7 foot tall His legs didn't seem to stretch out straight like we people do I decided to stop at a park on the outskirts of Cave Junction to smoke and stretch my legs Another camper a few hundred feet away had dogs that starting going crazy barking 200yards from were they stood and looked for tracks non were found the ground was dry and hard to much low foot brush  They described it as being huge, maybe eight feet tall and standing on two legs I could hear the bare feet slapping the road surface as it ran One other lighter note: I learned later that night that eyelashes on the nylon inner lining of a down mummy bag sound a lot like cruching leaves but without the footfalls! Needless to say, it took a while to fall asleep that night  When I saw this very large, seemed to be dark in color, come running across the road at a very fast speed!!!  I was very tired and thought that maybe it was a large elk or something Before I awoke to the footsteps, he heard at least two different vocalizing/mumbling sounds with walking around our tent It was too dark to see but Im sure it was stopped looking back at me from a distance of approximately 75ft  HE TOLD ME THAT I JUST SAW A BIG FOOT DEN The Bigfoot was walking upright on two feet As soon as day break came, I took the film camera and took pictures of the footprints, heading both north and south on the beach Now I must interject at this point that my friend and I are not easily frightened and also that he is 6'4"" and to pull his legs up to his chest in a Toyota 4Runner is not the easiest of movements  This was definitely not the time or place one would encounter someone out for a leisurely ""stretch of the legs"" I didn't see anything, and had just about got myself calmed down when I heard a twig snap in some dense jackpines maybe 60 feet from me  It was dark, so what we observed was all caught by the head lights of our car BIGFOOT SIGHTING By:	Jim Kiser Sighting date:	Early July, 1972 Sighting location:	Wallowa Mountains, Eastern Oregon Report prepared:	June, 2012 to June, 2013 Report printed:	June 14, 2013 On a family vacation in the remote mountains of eastern Oregon, I witnessed in broad daylight, what I believe was a family of sasquatches Anyhow, I came upon a small spot of soft dirt next to a trunk and saw a footprint about an inch deep We finally agreed that it may have been a bigfoot  Now in a flash I excitedly thought “They do exist!  I’m looking at them!  Sasquatches are real! Maybe that film wasn’t a hoax!” I shook my wife to wake her and began simultaneously telling her to wake up, get the camera out of the back seat, take a photo, count the creatures, and that I thought bigfoots were real and that we were seeing several of them I told them I think I just saw a bigfoot - they laughed IT had gone off the southwest side of the mountain through the densest part of the Hairy Manzanita tall and looked like a man with no neck in a ghilli suit. I saw the object was gone and as I swung to the right I saw two brown legs to the waist through the saplings running as fluid and fast as any thing I have ever seen It had to be about 71/2 feet tall  They were uniformly dark in color from head to foot"
Pennsylvania,"I hunted those woods for years and there were times that I felt I was being watched, We heard vocalizations one night but my father said it was a bobcat, after hearing bigfoot recordings I believe they are what made the noise. I was awakened by the sound of the old wooden table and chairs being pushed about on the deck Total black with long arms and legs. Its left arm stayed hanging to its side – very long arms AND AS I SAT THERE I COULDNT HELP BUT THINK ABOUT THE ""BABY BIGFOOT PICS TAKEN FROM A TRAIL CAM IN FOREST COUNTY IN 2008"" IT MADE ME FEEL A LITTLE UNEASY, BEACAUSE I BELIEVE THESE CREATURES EXIST AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY 7 to 8 feet tall  All of a sudden, a very tall figure crossed right in front of our car I laughed and jokingly said it was bigfoot and with that my uncle started rambling about even if it was  He was tall, at least 7 feet, as his knees were just barely covered by the log I would wait until the other boys and the counselor would fall asleep ,then sneak out a few feet from the cabin to quickly pee The fur appeared to go all the way to the ground around the feet After seeing them running , out of the corner of my eye I noticed something large and black or very dark brown in the lower field  I do believe in Bigfoot, I always have  There was very little or no “bobbing” up and down; his arms swung, but not wildly, like you would expect with an ape There was a huge space between his legs I wasn't out looking for a bigfoot that day I noticed that the eyes were black, or very dark and deep, with a pronounced brow ridge It is still hard for me to grasp that anything could throw rocks from approximately 90 feet away and hit the same general area – very, very accurate Before running, I noticed that what I was looking at was about 7 feet tall, relatively the same proportions as a normal human, except for longer arms, and it was covered with shaggy (2-4"" long) grey hair Last year 2015 saw this animal two times! Eye shine was very large! Then on March 22, 2016 at around 2:30 AM saw a large (possible) bigfoot! This was upright walking thru my back yard! It was taller than my swing set, wider than my self and saw eye shine! All from my kitchen window! This made me a little scared! Went out trying to find prints but the ground was very hard pack as we had a below freeze at 25 degrees that night! I then called the BRFO to tell about what I had seen!  I know this bigfoot had to be 7' 5"" tall and at least 650 lbs even though I am an experienced hunter and tracker, I felt goose bumps and the hair on the back of my neck was standing up and I left after I locked the doors  I know there are many made up hoax bigfoot stories out there, but I can assure you that this is NOT one of them In the area that it is, borders a huge swamp on one side and is one of the darkest places I have ever been My son-in-law (Eric) and I arrived about 8-8:30 at night in the darkness  And when I did, I looked around the area I heard the battle, and found a bunch of deer hair and bones scattered around a 20 foot area, But no (HENRY) On October 5, 2022 while my boyfriend and I were biking on the Ghost Town Trails near Ebensburg PA we saw a bigfoot come about 150 yds in front us But when he got nearer it was too dark in the wooded valley for him to see the creature I did say to my family ""I think I just saw a Bigfoot!"" but they didn't believe me It was starting to get dark and we were working diligently to start a fire When I found the deer I was getting everything set up to take pictures and I heard this scream that made the hair on my neck stand up I assumed the field had high growth in it as I only saw the upper portion.It was only the upper body and head with the hair obscuring any sign of a neck.I could not estimate size but it was stocky This revelation redoubled my resolve not to venture to the outhouse after dark I told my cousin about this event a few weeks after it happened, and her eyes got big and told me that one of her friends and her mom seen some big creature walking through a field below their house  Then I was up around 6am but it was dark at that time  I continued talking to tommy for about another 20 minutes when i smelled something strange and happened to look up and see a figure in the middle of our field that appeared to be about 8 or 9 feet tall On the morning noted a neighborhood man was driving down Pilottown Road around 4-5 in the morning when he came across large human-like footprints crossing the road and heading into a field/wooded area And had seen them stand up on two legs  It stood the hairs on my neck Here goes, I guess depending upon how you look at it I am either the luckiest person where Bigfoot is concerned or unfortunate in that coming forward in some people's eyes makes me either a story teller or a nut The hair was medium in length, dirty brown I attend conferences and have actually received an invitation to Beachfoot in Oregon in 2016 I could not see clear details of the face as it was all black as well but it did not appear to have hair on all of its face When I arrived I observed the bigfoot at about 50 yrds, It must have heard me as it stopped and turned its upper torso and looked at me It was getting dark now and me and my friend was all that was left  It was extremely dark and I could not see my hand in front of my face When the figure stood up it was a good 2 feet taller than us so that would put it around 7'5"" I have heard similar recordings on websites devoted to the north american great ape theory aka; bigfoot  I felt extremely special to have had this experience, and I didn’t want to betray that or the Bigfoot Me and my brothers were playing on these dirt hills behind our house.We were all having fun.When i got this feeling that something was watching me.So i turned around and i saw something that i will never forget.It was maybe 8 feet tall.Standing on 2 legs coverd in brown hair.As soon as i seen it,it just slowly turned around and walked away.When it walked away it swinged its arms up and down.Then i ran home to tell my mother.She said it might have been a deer or bear.But the don't walk away on 2 legs and swing there arms.the next day i went to show them where i saw it and there was small trees twisted down and foot prints.I was 12 when i seen it,i am 22 now and i will never forget what i saw. As darkness set in, I decided to venture out to the open meadow to observe the Winter constellations Almost as soon as my eyes were at its head and face and I was trying to “zoom in” and get a better look at the face, it began to leave As I listened, it was apparent the foot falls were from a biped Most have experienced hearing knocks, LOUD branch breaks, hearing bi-pedal footsteps emanating from a creature much larger than a human would make, smelled noxious odors, and had that inexplicable feeling of being watched  It was very large and was covered in dark brown to black hair from head to foot I never gave it much thought about Bigfoot and Washington/Oregon state but it was interesting to see that this research was genuine and scientifically based everybody said oh deer or bear.i say no not on 2 legs I had never heard of bigfoot and wouldn't hear of him until some 7,8 or 9 yrs later  The whooping sound was heard two (2) times and the footsteps gradually faded  He had hair like that of a black bear’s fur that time of year, basically the same color and length, which obscured a lot of the features of his face When it stood, we saw was that it was at least 2 feet taller than us Some years later I visited a wax museum in Niagara Falls and at the end of the exhibit was somebody's idea of a bigfoot  His hair was maybe 2 inches long and his hands were definitely below knee level If it killed an animal I wasnt sure what it would do to me! I do believe in Bigfoot now. He kept whining and brushing at my legs not wanting me to go through the field He/She was close to 8 feet tall and extremely muscualr it was july 1 2005 i drive a tri axle dump my boss ask me to deliver some stone to a remote camp he took me to the location first by pick up it was a very remote camp  the next day i took aload of stone to the camp and dump it the fallowing day i took another load of stone to the location to tailgate it i went to the camp to turn around to tailgate out to the main rd when i got out to chain my gate i had i wierd feeling that something was watching me i scaned the woods nothing i went on about my work i drove out the road about 150 yards raised my box in the air the tried to trip my gate it dident trip then it did dumping a2 foot pile of stone i finaly got the truck into gear and started to tail gate it i went about 75 yards i dident have my chains set right so back up to the pile of stone that i dumped when i back around the corner there was a sin color animal on the stone it look like a 250 to300 pound bear i kept backing the back up alarm was beeping but still this animal did not look at me i got about 5or6 feet and hit my brakes it stood up most of it was behiund the truck i then seen something else run across the road i went to the other mirror nothing i went back to drivers mirror the animal was gone i got out walk to the back of the truck there was nothing i scanned the woods it was gone i fix my chains and started to tailgate agian to my surprise i went about 40 yards and i look in my mirror there was 2 of these animals walking upright the big one was about8or9 feet tallvery large redish brown hair black face it scared me i took off went to my boss we went back up ther with a couple of other people we had flash lights when we first got out of the trk we heard a high pitch whissle and hoot or howl ive never heard this in the woods after all im a advid hunter something big took off runing throught the woods there where foot prints in the stone we measured them the one was 17 inchs and 7 in acrossed the other were10 inches we took pictures of the foot prints i thought you would like to know about this sighting i know it changed my out look on this matter i never believed in this i know what i saw it was bigfoot it will change the way i feel about the woods my gaurd will be up for know on thank you tghe nanimal had very hairy body black face it looked just like the picture on the home page of the web sight standing next to the man I glanced away from the beams and when I looked back at the road I was coming to the bottom of a dip in the road and as I looked back at the road I saw TWO VERY LARGE LEGS WITH EXTREMELY LARGE FEET ATTACHED ! I saw three strides and it was across the road and the fourth step took it up a 7 foot bank The creature was standing on two feet and had almost a human like form except for its nearly 9 foot stature I cannot attach that picture yet as the Ohio Bigfoot conference director has asked not to put it out there until after the conference One of the dogs hair was standing on end from the base of his tail to the back of his neck as he sniffed the wind and repeatedly barked in the upwind direction 80 to 100 feet long and 2 ½ feet wide and the crown caused it to be about three to four feet off the ground) and had made it to the base when we both spotted a humped shape covered with brown hair or fur  We continued on our way, the smell dissipated after about 100 feet We played until it started to get dark I was driving home from work about 2 weeks ago, and my grandma and I saw a 4 1/2 foot tall creature It didn’t turn and walk away, but rather it stepped straight backwards into the brush and the trees and not take its eyes away from me It was in front of some woods, not dense, standing about 150 feet away on the other side of a strip of narrow, fallow, farm field Long arms and maybe 8 to 10 feet tall It was long hair covered and I could not see a face In the morning, we found the table and chairs had been moved about, which a bear or even a large raccoon could have done I didn't instantly think ""Bigfoot"" as I wasn’t a REAL believer then When it started running was when I got scared, it was on two legs Anyways, we weren't very busy at work, so my uncle is walkin around and looks out the back door, he stops, and yells to me, HEY COME HERE!  So i run over to where he's standing and see this big black hairy thing running down the hill I figured if i could see his eyes he probably could see mine The thing that was most apparent to me was the distance between the foot prints, which approximately 4' apart Before long I heard what I assumed were a couple of hunters talking to each other loudly.But what they said made no sense.It sounded like the japanese language played backwards.The hunters were moving uphill and covered a distance of about 200 yards in 12-15 seconds!!!There was a foot of snow on the ground and the hill had about a 30 degree grade.(I did the math..its about 45 mph)!I was puzzled and just figured my mind was playing tricks on me.Then I heard loud limbs breaking and expected to see deer run ahead of the ""hunters"" so I got ready.After about 5 minutes a movement out of the corner of my left eye got my attention.There was a lone pine tree swaying like it was in a hurricane.The top of the tree was moving severely to the left and right about 40 degrees!Something was standing under the tree which appearred to be moving it.It was about 7 feet tall and I saw it for about 5 seconds.Its ""arm""? came down and it took a step forward.It then moved a couple steps and was behind a group of trees.I would say the color of the hair was medium brown with a slightly lighter area.When it stepped behind the trees it never came out the other side.Keep in mind these trees were spaced about a foot apart and were maybe 8 inches in diameter.The odd thing was you could not see any hair between the trees or movement even through my scope.I was about 70 yards from the thing and couldn't understand where it went.I knew it would have left tracks but something overwealming told me to stay away.I had what others have described as a sense of ""doom"" which is a good description.That was it.No smell or other events.I never knew what to think of what happened and stopped hunting after that.Since then I found this site and that memory came rushing back after reading a number of the stories.I did not get a good look at the ""thing"" but it was not anything I had ever seen in the woods. I then began to sit on our balcony and look around more after I had lost visual of the shining eyes  A supposed bigfoot recording from Westmoreland County PA and the 1994 Ohio Howl in particular were eerily similar I heard footfalls come around to the front of the open cabin door I now cannot put Bigfoot stuff down and even started a bigfoot book collection with some very old and hard to find, autographed bigfoot books  He was dark brown or black in color unable to tell exactly due to lighting issues As I swerved it was already nearly off the road all I could see though my drivers window were what seemed to be piercing blue eyes that seemed to glow I’d say the hair was an average of 3 to 5 inches long, shorter at the head I turned to see what it was and saw this human like figure, a little over five feet tall, not really heavy, covered with hair not like a bear but long like hair on the hooves of Clydesdale horses I happened to notice something standing at the tree line at the top of the field that was rather tall and I thought at first it was a bear as they are common in the area I turned to look at it further and soon the two red spots formed eyes, very large eyes, I kept watching from where I stood and the eyes looked right at me,we were looking at each other [Editor's Note: ""Mushroom mines"" are underground coal mines that were converted into subterranean farms for growing mushrooms I was driving at 45 MPH When my uncle says "" what the hell is that?"" I asked what he saw and his reply was "" what ever it is it was walking on two feet As I was reading about other sightings one night, the memory of that camping experience came flooding back with the realization that I had come face to face with a Bigfoot  We were shocked!  It must have been at least 7ft.+ tall, long arms, hairy body, ape-like appearance, very slender We found the tangle of brush the figure was behind and saw a large clear space, the size of which a small family of deer would have made, but there were no tracks, neither foot-prints or hoof-prints It was all hairy from what I remember  I put my binos down and it was then he must have noticed something and within 3 strides he disappeared into the grapevine thicket  Remember; the log was about 50 yards down a steep hill, and the log was about 3 feet tall, and crossing the pipeline The hair was short to medium length and not shaggy The sighting was quick no longer then 5-6 seconds at a distance of 70 yards on a cloudless moon lit night.My uncle said the subject was walking up the steep embankment that is covered in almost a foot of snow and bare of trees or brush behind the rv building on a horizontal path on two legs towards the woodline on top of the hill I had also noticed a long impression behind the house that looks like a footprint up against the cabin by the window but was not good enough to say it was from a bigfoot, but at the same time it was adding up It appeared to be black skin - the same color black as its hair but I could tell it wasn't hair in some spots Yes, Big Foot does exist!!! It was much taller than a normal human – best guess at this point would be 7.5 feet or so, and absolutely NOT a bear As my eyes made their way up on the creature I could see its head was all black as well  It was all very dark black – a shiny black – from head to toe, or as far as I could see to its feet as it was standing in 1-2 foot tall grass or taller This night i heard footsteps returning to the cabin thru the forest not the path from another direction We had just passed the Grove City Outlets exit, about one or two miles, when I glanced to my left across the road and saw a Bigfoot walking back into the woods from the roadside brush.  For this years Ohio Bigfoot conference, Sybilla Irwin (a BFRO member and artist) is doing a drawing of what I've described to her, and will be unveiling it at the conference  I knew the walking was bipedal and at this point in time I got very angry about somebody tresspassing and ruining my day of deer hunting On Saturday, August 15, 2015 @ about 8:20 PM (Right before it got dark at about 8:30ish.), my family and I were driving home along I-70 South towards Pittsburgh As I was observing the stars and enjoying the silence, I heard footsteps The animal was between 6 and 7 ft tall with a dark face, after looking at me it made great strides down the creekbed and was gone around the bend  It was always creepy dark back there, too Back when this happened I was about 8-10 years old, and didn't think of looking for hair samples or DNA, or even footprints Coyote have never made the hair stand up on my neck before and I can identify about every call in the woods in this part of the country I never believed in ""Bigfoot"" but this is hard to ignore The shape was about 10 feet in front of us and was close to a tangle of vines and brush I started to get up for our trip home when I looked behind us, seeing a very tall figure, standing about 20 yards from us The figure was huge--very tall and hairy But seeing that someone else thinks they saw a Bigfoot near Meander Reservoir makes me want to tell my story too Didn't get a look at his face but as he was walking you could see how big his stride was I, thinking it was a brown bear, yelled very loud to spook it and make it run, but the large figure turned and looked us in the eyes and ran I was in disbelief--I have always wanted to see a Bigfoot but I was speechless at the time it was actually occurring It was the color of dark rust It was on two legs and dissapeared right after I screamed It definatly wasn't a bear, a bear can't run down a hill on 2 feet  I did quite a bit of hunting in Elk County, and it’s very easy for me to believe that those photos show a real, Bigfoot animal As it crossed in front of my car I could see it more clearly in my headlights, it was a very dark brown, but it was more like hair than fur which I found to be even stranger  I still do leave the option open for an extremely large man (larger than anyone I have ever met) in a heavily padded Gillie suit with hair on it standing about 100 foot from the trail just waiting for someone to stop in that exact spot so he could throw rocks at him and take a chance of getting shot (most folks on ATVs will pack a handgun when riding in deep woods  Back then, all the Bigfoot sightings were in Washington/Oregon/California We then went inside and I grabbed the spotlight and I was scanning through the yard and saw two sets of bright red eyes walking to the field  The bear would have to be very large for me to see as much as I did, which was a good foot or more above the log, and he was on the other side of it The tracks were about 16"" long, 8.5"" wide, and 2"" deep in the snow, and had a stride of about 4 feet I believe there could be such things as Bigfoot, although I am not sure It was on 2 legs and I could see its right arm hanging down, which was on the left side because it was facing me His eyes reflected like a cat's eyes with like almost red and yellow mixed It may seem a very incredible way of preserving the footprint, but it was the only thing I could think to do to preserve it I saw a large dark figure with hair that could throw rocks (and very accurately), stand up within 100 feet from me, in a large dense forest where there aren't any cabins or people just hanging out I noticed this “Stump” which turned out to be a dark figure, approximately 70-90 feet away, that appeared to be in a sitting or crouching, or just a low position, then stand up into an upright position A few seconds later, a Sasquatch (7.5-8 foot tall, reddish brown hair) came following them.  This thing was very big and hairy like an ape, and it moved very very fast. The fur appeared to be long and very dark, almost black but with a bit of a sheen to it I remember that it was dark perhaps 10PM and the area was dimly lit by the outsise lights at the firehall  It was almost groomed in appearance but I think it’s from the hair being short and thick I haven't been able to sleep much since, all I can think about is those piercing eyes  Being young and curious I ran about 75 yds to the spot the animal had entered, there was a small drop off of about 20 feet then a level spot about 10 ft, then another 4 ft drop to the creek bed"
Quebec,
Rhode Island,"The nose and mouth are human like, it's nose is wide, around the mouth black hair that went down on each side.It looks up with its head and chest see me, eyeball to eyeball as I look back trying to see if this thing is real Very dark in the area because it being mostly wooded, country like setting but yet city The face dark, deep strong  but primate.The eyes are close together and set deep in the face The differences were in color, he stated white (the one i saw was more grey) and said the one he saw was eight feet tall That is when I noticed a young tree that was snapped in half at about six feet off the ground Directly in front of me was a small field that sloped down and away from me,pitch black background, tall grass and a few bushes being light by the street light I've never seen a picture of a bigfoot on my film I'm not a fan of ghosts, UFO's or even big foot I looked for footprints and hair but didn't find any  Once I registered what I was seeing I also realized that whatever it was, it had walked on two legs It was maybe 6 to 7 feet tall, its hair was long, face flat, long massive arms, its head appeared to be without any neck, its chest was broad  The road is very dark and heavily wooded in this particular area Twenty maybe twenty five feet away, directly across the street from me perhads six feet tall maybe 400 pounds or more My heart was pounding out of my chest, my eyes had tears in them and with all my might I pedaled as it ran on two legs, then down on its knuckles then back up again I'd estimate maybe six feet at best As I was fixing my brake I began hearing very loud foot steps of a biped, comig from the field on the slope side,more like a crushing thud Perhaps for ten yards, I remember how its long hair on its arms moved with each reach,I thank god I was in first gear From out of the darkness steps into the street light this white looking gorilla The arms were not long like a gorilla and oddly it was no were near seven-feet tall Massive arms that went straight down on its knuckles, knees slight bent.The head is higher in the back connected to the neck all-in-one mass It was small, maybe three feet high, but constructed in the same woven-looking manner characteristic of other possible bigfoot stick formations We need no one to tall us what we saw, it's crystal clear Beside the tall fractured stump stood what looked like a large white(yellow white) ape The legs present themselves then the body as it comes to rest on its knuckles I have recently become very interested in bigfoot research, and based on reports that I found on this website of previous incidents in the area, decided to go to Great Swamp in Rhode Island to look for any evidence of bigfoot"
Saskatchewan,
South Carolina," I only saw it for about 15 seconds or so as we all just stood and stared in utter shock before I got the hell out of there, running and screaming along with my brother and neighbor back to the house! It seemed to be at least 7 feet tall and had very long arms and was very hairy with long tufts of dark brown hair covering it's body We all went outside and we could hear it running slow heavy footsteps, it went over our fence into the woods,we did'nt see it but we could hear it It did not have a natural gait and the body was too thin to be a horse and it was too tall to be a bear It was just before dark and I saw something ahead on all fours crossing the road I was about ready to call it a night when I heard distinct footsteps coming towards me My family member had come out to let the dog out to go to the bathroom and had seen the footprint, too, but I told them to go back in the house  It was lined with pine trees about twelve feet tall I WAS AHEAD OF BRIAN AND LOOKED BACK TO SEE WHERE BRIAN WAS, ON THE TURN I SAW SOMETHING WHITISH IN COLOR THAT HAD MOVED FROM THE ROAD SIDE OF THE FENCE[BARBEDWIRE 3 TO 4 FEET HIGH]TO THE OTHER SIDE,MOVING FAST.I NEVER REALLY GOT A GOOD LOOK AT IT BUT I DID SEE SOMETHING WHITISH IN COLOR KNOCKING BRANCHES OUT OF THE WAY.THE ONLY THING I COULD THINK OF IT BEING WAS A HORSE BECAUSE OF THE HIEGHT.I WENT TO THE SAME SPOT THE NEXT DAY AND QUICKLEY DECIDED THAT A HORSE WOULD NOT MOVE THAT FAST THROUGH  THAT TYPE OF COVER.I NEVER THOUGHT FOR ONE MOMENT IT WAS A BIGFOOT [BECAUSE OF THE COLOR]UNTIL I WENT ON THIS SIGHT.TALKING ABOUT THIS TO MY BROTHER LATER MADE HIM REMEMBER SOMETHIG HE HAS SEEN.I AM TRYING TO TALK HIM IN TO REPORTING IT.I WISH I COULD REMEMBER MORE DETAIL ,SORRY,BUT I KNOW IT WAS NOT A HORSE OR BEAR,ECT.I CAN GET ROAD NAMES IF IT WILL HELP It had wide bold shoulders and hair partly covering its forehead The only reason I knew it was looking at us was because it's eyes were glowing red from the flashlight From my estimation it looked to be at least 75 to 100 yards away, and about 6 or 7 feet tall What made me recall this, was the footage; where the men on horses record it walking away It ran away on four legs He was far enough ahead that I did not take my foot of the gas peddle, but watched him cross the road He crossed the road in four steps and at no time during this did the sun show between his legs above the knee The hair on my neck raised and I started to speak but was unable to  Standing, it would probably be 9 feet tall from my opinion. There, literally right up against the corner of the house less than one foot from the wall of the house, as if something had been standing facing the house and leaning against it, was one barefooted human-shaped footprint at least 12"" long and 6"" wide and about an inch or two deep It went about fifty to seventy-five feet away and just stood there I witnessed a 8-9 ft tall upright hominoid creature with black hair and brownish grey skin apparent on its face chest and abdomen It was just starting to become ligher out, it was about 6:45am, and it was still quite dark out Its chest was massive and it had a white spot in its chest about two foot across It had a body like a large human covered with hair The footsteps parralelled me back to the parking area but never came out of the woodline of more coarse gray hair, the color of a gray fox or coyote It was covered from head to toe (with exception to the already mentioned facial area in the orange-brown fur...It had two apparent arms, I never really saw the legs since they were underneath the animal and hidden by the ditch and was much larger than I had initially thought I looked out of my drivers side window and noticed that its shoulders were above the top of my van and I also noticed that it was covered in hair that was light in color The creature stood about 7-8 feet tall and probably weighed about 400 to 450 lbs Anyway I backed into the house never taking my eyes off of it until I went inside  The reason I knew the animal was stooped or bent over was because when it turned to look at me, it had to push itself up out of the ditch with it's arms (hands, I assume) and turn around--it was initially facing in the direction I was driving (SSE) and was apparently standing, still slightly stooped over, when I passed I crossed the road in ten steps or six hard strides, but I did not find any thing to tell me what I seen that morning. It was the darkest night I ever spent in the woods alone  After a day of searching I found the recordings of wolf and coyote here and the whooping and calls we heard most closely resembled the suspected bigfoot whoops on this site. afterwords many people my pastor among many  indicated that this creature had been seen and heard for many years in the area, I am now am a airline captain ex fighter pilot and hold a degree in zooology, one night I was watching monsterquest and heard a bigfoot scream my girlfriend said I turned white and started to shake  My brother said it was large and hairy There was also noticeable scraggly matted hair hanging from its arms For years our neighbors would tell us that there was a bigfoot that roamed the woods where we lived Much to my surprise I saw a creature in mid-stride just as it was about to leap over a ditch by the roadside  Again, I did not notice much about the legs since I did not see much of them--I will say that the chest was MUCH larger than the mid (and butt) section and it never turned fully around--but what I did notice was the arms We were on the backside of the property which had woods behind it.You could see red eyes glowing in the dark but I could not say how tall it was.I do know that it was taller than a human being On the right footprint the odd thing about it was that I couldn't find the little toe: all the other ones were clearly marked It was after 9 pm and dark now  As I closed up on it I saw that it had dark brown hair that was several inches long I could see nothing, no eyes or anything The eyes were wide set and large It was dark brown at least 6 to 7 foot tall  It was a very dark night and I could only see the animal with the headlights  All I could make out was a large, hairy figure leaning on a large tree trunk beside the creek I slowed way down to look for him but I could not find hide nor hair of any one I was topping the hill when movement caught my eyes, about 800 to 900 ft The print was able to be made, I suppose, because there was dirt mound there from where the bushes are planted, but when I looked for where the left footprint could've been, if something was standing against the corner of the house, I didn't find anything because the dirt was covered with leaves and pinestraw I was sitting next to the window and the sound sounded like it was from the same level my head was at of between three and four feet The creature was walking upright, taking strides quickly to our left,  and disappeared into the bush on the left side of the road directly in front of us I began shining my Q-beam spotlight around in the darkness When he stepped into the road his first stride put him in the center of my lane  As we were rounding a slight curve on the exit road, we all spotted a creature walking quickly on the left side of the road approximately 15 to 20 feet in front of our car it was very bright and this was easy to do once my eyes adjusted to the darkness  I was approx  50 yards away when it saw me the light was very low but I saw this thing was not human at all, at least 7 to 8 ft tall 450, lbs no neck and reddish in color I waited until a little before dark and walked out to meet the pick - up vehicle It looked to be covered in brownish hair all over There are many depressions in the soil so I was unable to discern where the footprint depression may have been It was large and dark colored I was back visiting the same family member MAY08 and looked to see if any evidence of the footprint existed and nothing did that I could identify Being dark as it was, it's hard to say just how big it was but I would guess around 7 feet tall  I do believe in bigfoot and was happy this happend to me It was tall had dark brown hair and it had a sloping forehead that looked like some kind of ape.I could not see the eyes because they were hooded The day i saw what i believe to be a bigfoot was a summer day around 7:45 to 8:30ish I was still driving so I couldn't just take my eyes completely off the road, (I should have stopped) but as much a I could, I looked up the small hill, there was a massive creature on top of the hill with gray coarse hair about 3 to 4 in I believe it to be a bigfoot on all fours The jump that it made cleared 14 to 16 feet with no problem The height of the creature is estimated as being between 5 to 6 feet tall At first I thought it might be a man, but it was all black and it turned and I saw large red eyes staring back As I remember the incident happened at seven pm just after dark  Legs were approximately 3 feet long, human like jointed knee, with dark brown, splotchy black hair that was approximately 2 inches long I was happy that I would have someone to be with this dark night as I approached nearer to this shape I noticed that it was human like because it was standing erect on 2 legs and it had arms like a man however, when I got within 40 ft of this creature I realized that it wasn't a bear or a deer and that it appeared to be very tall When I passed I looked in the mirror, but it was too dark to make any discernable shape in the ditch  The ditch was probably 3 to 4 feet deep and the animal (stooped or bent over) rose above the ditch about 4 to 5 more feet We were going down this road and way out in front of us, out to the point where the headlights barely reach, we saw something cross the road on two legs  This bank was a support for a railroad track and was nearly straight up for about 50 feet"
South Dakota,"i could still remember seeing the reddish-brown hair which covered the thing  We have also found hair; possible saliva mixed with grass, and dried blood stains on cactus  The creature appears to be seven to nine feet tall and has left a couple of footprints that measured 18 inches long and 7 inches wide At about 5:20 in the evening along the side of the road was a large bigfoot.I  looked right at him as I drove by   Their fields run right up to the forest, probably not even a football fields length away Now rotate the ""L"" 1/4 turn to the right, apply that to moving stream water, my camp sits above the water 20 to 30 feet in the inside turn of the ""L"" from the chest to the arms About 200 to 300 ft or so from when i turned there was a dark figure on the right hand side of the road crouching down the hair looked to be approx This would have made it a little over 7 feet tall I was Driving truck and this was about at 5 in the morning still dark in the fall of the year around the end of november this thing was tall enough to look into the top of the passengers side window of my straight truck At first i thought it was a deer or a fabled moutian lion but it was too dark colored and the only thing that made me write this now was as i drove past it it stood up the arms were long and slim, i do not remember seeing the hands as i was coming over a hill (the ditch area is approx.4-5 feet deep, on both sides of the gravel road) my patrol unit was a chevy tahoe, which did sit kind of high to the ground It was Reddish brown in color ,hairy,very tall, with long big arms and slightly hunched over"
State not found,"I remember very clearly the part in the hair along the spine, due to the wet weather The road cut was covered with grass about 2 feet high and was about 10 feet high and proabably at a 70 degree angle It was big, at least 7 feet tall The animal must have been at least 6 foot long and had very long hair along its spine as I was walking back which was probably 10 to 15 minutes later the traffic was bothering me so when i approached the same section of woods to get away from the highway I heard an even louder scatter in the bushes about 10 to 20 feet in the woods  It covering ground way too fast and did so on two legs! It was very tall, but I could only see its profile, so I have no idea of how broad it was What I could clearly see is that it ran upright, with long strides, swinging its arms and it looked to me like it was covered in shreds I was driving pretty fast back down and did not look anywhere, just eyes on the road the hair looked to be about maybe 5 inches long and a light redish color What always struck me as odd is that the animals spine did not flex like that of a bear when it was moving, and that its rear legs were not directly under it, more out to its sides as it climbed out of sight It was about 9 feet tall really hairy and walking with a slight crouched posture, It was headed East to the ocean I passed within 15 feet of the animal as it climbed very quickly to the top of the road cut and out of sight I started off agian and I could hear another couple of footsteps that sounded as if it was the size of a bear Just where the road turns left, bearing around the corner, it made one great leap, planting one food on the pavement and clearing the grass/graveled side of the road, plus several feet of tall grass and smoothly plummeted out of sight down the steep embankment I saw it briefly as we passed to where it crossed the road but it was moving really fast, not running just really long strides as I approached an area that was partially lit by a company that had an outside light on i could see at the edge of the woods a creature that apeared to be squating down with its long arms in front of it We thought it was a bear about ten yards but it seemed like it was taking a knee so we stared at it for about a minute then it got up onto its feet and started walking to our position and we did nothing as it walked between our fighting holes which were about 15 feet apart As it passed by us, it knew that we were there because it didn't keep his eyes off of us, he  looked down at me directly as it passed by then he stopped about 15 feet away, and turned around, but not completely, he turned at his waist to a look back and disappeared Well he did so and we were leaving the area and after we traveled about 100 yards or so there it was one of the biggest Bigfoots right in front of us"
Tennessee,"As we got closer to what I thought was a bear, turned out to be a bigfoot There is a bigfoot on  **** Road in Pine Knot,  KY  When I got home I was still shaking and still had tears in my eyes I believe I saw a bigfoot in the flesh to this day once we got there he told us that he turned a corner to see the eyes staring down at him just off the path.  I believe I saw bigfoot hello all i am a 56 year old woman that has never gave a second thought to the life of what people call a bigfoot.I knew him as whistling Paddy as a child that is what my Grandparents and all the neighbors called him.Our neighbors were far and few between but every one of them knew the whistling paddy that is what they called him.I myself can remember his screaming and whistling sounds as a child.We lived in the deep woods in Ethridge Tennessee no electricty or indoor plumming.He was always around and we were used to his sounds and he came for scraps at night he did not eat any meat only pealings from patatoes and other veg.He or she was white with red eyes like as i know some folks are called alibalino i guess.My grandparents were not learned people they could not read or wright they had to sgin with an x but they knew he was real and they did not fear him and saw him or her lots of times and thought it was okay they called it him so i guess it was a male.My aunt who lived about a mile awat opened her back door one night to throw out her dishwater and threw it on patty because he was standing at the back door It did not scare her because she was used to him although she had 9 children she went and got some potatoes and gave him for she said he was hungry.This Paddy was about 7 to 8 feet tall and did not ever hurt anyone.I would like to know if anyone else has ever heard one called a whistling Paddy because that was what he was called when I was a small child growing up in those woods.And we did not fear him but we had to come inside right before dark cause mamaw would say paddy is out here and we can't trust him we dont know who he is.If anyone else ever knew of a bigfoot that was called  by the name of whistling Paddy i would like to know my grandparents were Indian and knew many things but were not smart when it came to the real world they knew how to get by with 10 children and live a good life in the woods and how spider webs packed into a wound would stop bleeding and they knew as i did paddy was real. It was more like a gorilla or person covered with hair It bounded with its front legs in the same way that a gorilla does except it’s arms were so long and it moved unbelievably fast One afternoon, a couple hours before dark, in early October of 1988, I was riding my ATV on an old logging road, which ran along a creek, in the bottom of a holler (valley between two ridges)  On my hikes I am normally under a full canopy of very tall trees It was getting dark so we drove on down the mountain  He had to be able to see in the dark to negotiate that partly cleared lot 7' tall, broad from shoulders down through torso, large head, covered entirely with dark (hair), standing upright with arms straight down by side I could see that the bigfoot was fearful of the storm and was looking for shelter I was trying to get my phone out and attempt to take a picture when the creature stomped the ground with its foot and growled something incredibly fierce several times all he could say was that something was staring down at him and show us how far apart its eyes were It was only about five feet from the front of our vehicle at one point when we turned toward it I found several large footprints in some left over lime It was windy and dark so we took our flashlights and headed out We saw the shadow turn towards us and all we saw were the reflection of its eyes  No eyes, mouth, ears noticeable I looked at my buddy and said ""did you see that?"" and he said ""Yes, what was it?""  I said it looked like a baby bigfoot The power company had bush-hogged or cut the brush in a 150 foot-wide path, centered on the power line, as per routine maintenance  My husband and I were sitting on our deck looking up at the stars, so clearly visible up here on a clear night in the dark woods of the Cumberland Plateau it was squatting down with its arms around its knees just staring at him and when the light hit it in the eyes it just turned its head away  To this day I am not sure what it was that I saw but it was on two feet and very fast At first I thought it might be one of my grandpas cows, but cows don`t stand on two legs It was early morning, very dark and my campfire had long been extinguished and my propane lantern was spent Of course we considered that it could have been a person dressed in a hairy costume but it moved way too fast to be a person My friends were Robert (a tall well built guy and Paul, another large guy but not as tall as Robert)  When I was perhaps (guessing again)  100' to 125'  from it I hit the brakes hard - terrified to see a Bigfoot / Sasquatch stepping out onto the road However, the more I read, the more certain I am that me and my friends had a close encounter with a bigfoot My son,who is sitting beside me as i type this,says ""I just don't feel it meant any harm,it was puzzled as why we were there."" There were men cutting hay on the next farm over which had not been done in quite a while.There is no hunting,no more cattle,that place is not disturbed at all,so maybe it came from there?? What makes me believe even more is that my son LOVES hunting and that farm,but now says he is not coming up unless he has protection(Gun)and will not walk the place alone.Whatever this was or whatever happened to them has changed them.The friend,which said she doesn't believe in Bigfoot,now is a firm believer The track was around four-five inches longer than my shoed foot, which is a size twelve. (It was also a full moon.) All of a sudden, from down the river (it sounded like, anyway) we heard a loud,deep,howl (just like the recordings of Big Foot on tv) that lasted almost ten seconds  I know this because it never dropped down on all four of its feet the whole time we watched it and we probally saw it walk a total of only 30-40 yards but I am 100 % sure it was no bear  when it passed a break in the fence, I could see that it's legs were also covered in long hair There were six of driving toward shelby forest one night just after dark he said he went in the house to get a flashlight and when he came back outside he heard a noise so he shined the light up into the woods to look around, and as he came around with the light something reflected the beam and when he came back to the spot of the reflection in the grass just on the other side of his truck there was a creature that looked like a man covered in long shiny black hair with eyes about the size of a horses  It was tall enough that I could see down to it's legs over the fence  It was about 8:50 PM, dark and there was a heavy fog on the ground It was dark so I do not have a great description I always tell this story whenever there is big foot conversation I live in henderson county in west tennessee on the border of the natchez trace state park my home is about a 1/4 of a mile back from the road and is surounded by forest i have a small man made pond near my home that dosent have very much water in it right now my husband was doing some yard work around it when he noticed large foot prints down in the mud and some that were in the shallow water he called me outside to take a look It was crystal clear and I commented on how dark it was The red eyes were still on the North bank of the Forked Deer River, as if they were keeping watch on my Dad I'll start off by saying I have recently learned of some characteristics of the bigfoot aka tree knocks,rock throwing, howls ect. It was brownish grey in color and it was wet with rain looked like a long hair dog when wet We had never heard of bigfoot or sasquatch so I told my parents I had seen a bear  It turned toward the east, its' right, and taking long strides steped easily over the hog pen fence This figure was standing five to six feet infront of me but was looking me eye to eye.It grunted and growled in a low tone as if someone who was congested or out of breath.(thats the only way I can describe it)I could make out the shape of hair that was around the head area.I could also distinguish shoulders ,arms and a torso.The shoulders were very wide and no neck was visible.I coughed as if to alert that I was already hunting this spot however we did confirm the spot where he saw the animal with a steep incline about 15 feet off the trail  Seconds later it ran across again, this time it went from upright to all fours and back upright, it never broke stride Trees about 3.5 to 4 feet up were just broken off like the first time we encountered this It was dark  I do remember that its eyes caught light like an animals eyes, but I know from the shape and the way it jumped over the fence using its arms to lower the top wire that it was not a bear AnimalSeen : dark form in mist that sounded to run on 2 legs.  20 yrs have past and I still will not drive that road anytime close to dark I remember it was really dark that night because there was no moon I walked about 30 feet and there it was It was covered in dark brown or black hair I saw something in the shape of a man, black and hairy.It was walking into the edge of the woods just over a slight hill I shined my led light over to the area and saw a set of eyes for about two seconds before they vanished It swung its arms when it walked and its strides were about 4-6 feet long We did not even think to look for hair of footprints or anything like that Its hair was kind of shaggy I would guess the height to be somewhere in the 7+ foot tall range But the last time was very intence, I was walking home from town (about 3 miles away)and it was pretty dark so I was looking down most of the time It did not run on two feet the way a human would  The outside light was on and my two dogs, as usual, suddenly appeared out of the darkness to greet me At this point, I saw something that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up! From the brush on the left side of the road, something ran out in front of me It had a very long stride and walked like a human swinging it's long arms with it's stride  It was a tan color with places that were darker as if it were wet or muddy As the lights hit it, it turned and looked in our direction then looked in the direction of its regress (never looked in our direction again) and casually stride away We did not go look for tracks because it was just getting dark and we kept walking It swung its arms like a man and I could hear wide bipedal steps I wish at the time we had thought it could be Bigfoot, but we didn't, so we never took off into the night to look or it or look for prints I watched the creature for around 45 seconds and height estimate is at least 8feet and shoulder to shoulder 3 feet at least  My wife (who is a skeptic) agreed with me that it looked like a large bare footprint and you could definitely see what might be a big toe and maybe indentions of smaller toes  The animal broke itself out of it's fright and bounded off north, across the road, jumping a 4 and 1/2 foot fence and up the hill, quickly disappearing  Looking for more signs we came upon the footprint that was in much more solid ground The figure continued to stand in front of me and breath heavily.I then waived my hand and coughed again.At this point the figure turned walking back down hill on two legs,swinging its arms and going the same direction it had came from.I observed the figure until it walked out of my sight and hearing range.No one believes me.At one time ,this area was populated with members of the Cherokee Tribe As I continued to watch the thought ran through my head that someone had walked upon my spot to hunt and then I realized that the gentleman who owned the farm had only allowed my brother and myself to hunt.The rock I was sitting on was approximatly seven and a half to eight feet off of the ground  Not too long after this the dogs seemed to become more fearful, and my wife felt the hairs on the back of her neck raise up  To this day, I have never set foot in any woods again, essentially breaking a very longstanding and much revered habit that day all i know is that the animal was big and still ran off after being hit 6 times with buckshot from 10 feet away and still had enough air in its lungs to scream as loud as it did for that long It was black and tall maybe 7.5 to 8 ft tall Slighty off the road, there was a fence row about 6 feet above the level of the road It looked to be about 8-9 feet tall  It was very fast on it's feet I gasped and turned around real fast and told my mom and dad that I had just seen bigfoot And also moved like a bipedal creature. My husband and I were on our way home last fall and we saw what can only be described as a bigfoot walk across the road in front of us The bipedal was about 50 feet away I did search for footprints and any other evidence, but there were none to be found It was about 10 feet in front of me We were all kinda like what the hell ""I'm getting chills as i type this"" we were looking in the direction where the dog cam from and we saw a large, dark shadow just out of the light, just out of our clear vision from the fire He placed his foot inside the track, the track was larger then his boot  I could only really see it's eyes and nose for the hair A bigfoot came up behind her and tried to take a large bag of candy from her It was very tall, had reddish-brown hair, muscular build, stood upright and had a very gorilla-like face This is the story they have repeatedly told me all afternoon yesterday and this morning- They were walking the logging Rd,and my son started hearing these loud crashes in front of them to the right coming towards them,He said he stopped and felt ""Very uneasy"" about going any further,to which he told his friend ""he wasn't going any farther and she could if she wanted""..She walked around the bend of the road,come walking fast back to him  and says ""There was this thing looking at me behind a tree,swaying left to right,as if to see what she was..It leaned as if to be curious..So, She,not wanting to show it any harm by running or sudden  movement,afraid it would chase her,just turned and walked fast back to my son,and told him ""There is something huge and black standing around the corner""...My son started walking with her and turned back to see if he could see anything and it had came around the corner and was staring at them..He said it was between 7-8ft tall,had blackish/brown,almost like a turkeys feather color when the sun is not shining on its feathers, and had HUGE muscles showing through the fur,he especially notice how broad the shoulders were and how muscular the arms were.At that time they started running as fast as they could until they got to the field i was cutting. At the spot where the creature had stood were footprints in the dirt  We had both been leaning way back in our lawn chairs admiring the night sky, and almost fell out of our chairs in shock I coul see a dark shape, but it was misty and still a little dark Sitting up I saw the silouette of a humanoid figure at the top of the trail.(The closet comparison I can make would be similar to the alien in Predator.) I strained hard to make sure I was relly seeing what my eyes were telling me I was seeing The one thing I can remember is the bigfoot was searching for shelter quickly with the storm approaching  We went about a quarter of a mile, when from our left (South) a very tall (7' +), somewhat slender animal, covered with dark fur, head to toe, ran into the middle of the road and stopped as my uncle slammed on the brakes I turned around to see what the dog was barking at and then I saw it! A little over 100 feet away from me, it was standing at the electric fence separating the field from the woods so we walked probally 20 yards and saw what we believe is a bigfoot On this particular day, I got up to speed, fishtailed through the “dog-leg,” and proceeded to drive past the thick overgrowth, approximately 8-10 feet high, which ran under the power line That would be fine but it walked on 2 legs and had a backside of a human or ape As I was looking, I first noticed the height to be 6 1/2 to 7 foot tall, bi-pedal and shoulders that were the widest I had ever seen I’d say it only took about 2 steps to clear the 12-foot wide logging road Let me first say I'm glad you folks are out there and believe as truly as I do that bigfoot is real The creature had brown and red hair that was very thick, yet had a shine in the coat, a flat face and a distinct, almost white nose that looked very wide and brown eyes J's dad was a tall man and wore cowboy boots It looked hairy and not clothed Late in the evening with the shadows made it hard to see who or what it was I was just mad because a teenagers car is his pride and joy, so I took off towards it on the road but as I got closer to it I began to see ""something"" different began to take shape in the shadows that thing was way taller than anyone I've ever met and covered in matted hair I had to drive right by it and I was scared to death They ran a few feet and made some noise and stopped again to stare in the same direction It would make your hair stand up on your head and paralyze you for seconds when you heard it When we saw what we considered to be a bigfoot there was this terrible wet animal smell that was unmistakable  It appeared to be about 6'5"" to 8' tall and weigh about 225 to 275lbs Curiosity eventually got the best of me and I returned, still on my ATV, just as it was getting dark It was walking on two feet the entire crossing of the highway  Later that day I was over by the barn and saw the large foot prints repleat with toe marks  It was hairy but not like you see in ""bigfoot"" movies He was about 4 or 5 ft tall and you could see his arms swinging when he ran ran across the road from one cow pasture to the other headed towards the bluff and the river in the same direction as where we were going to hunt. It was tall, slender, smooth clean straight hair that coved the whole body and it's head just seemed to come out of the body with no noticable neck It was man-like (and please, give us some credit, it was not a bear)about eight feet tall and completely covered with medium dark brown hair At this point it was well past dark The animal cleared our neighbors 250-300 foot grass lawn in about six seconds and then it disappeared from view We all watched as the creature ran (not fast) away on two legs  I quickly ruled out tree climbing and decided the only alternative was to turn in the opposite direction and run as fast as my legs would carry me It was aproximately 7 to 8 feet tall and I would say weighed 300-350 pounds just guessing so i dont know what it was for sure but the only thing that makes since is bigfoot. I think, Big Foot is in those woods ,,,,,,,,,,,somewhere. It looked like what most people think a big foot looks like except it is an off white color, it is about 8-9 feet tall What came out of the field was a tall humanoid creature covered in dark brown hair that was slightly taller than the corn was at the time at about 6-7 feet It appeared to be tall and slender with a shaggy brown skin We had considered that maybe it was a bear but it was too ape like to have been a bear and it was too fast and slim and did not run on all four of its legs exactly the way a bear would have. All of a sudden from our vantage point, the lights illuminated the shadow side of a very tall being crossing the highway from the left to the right which was less than a half mile in front of us They were slightly larger than my 12 shoe and appeared to be a barefoot human, except bigger Just before the old logging road passed under the power line, there was a “dog-leg” in the road (the road went straight, made a quick 20 degree turn to the right, and immediately turned another 20 degrees back to the left, now running in the same direction as it was originally, just 3-4 feet to the right of the original vector) His description:  This creature was no more than about 6' tall, fully covered with a reddish brown fur (hair?) including it's face This creature stood head and shoulders taller than the trailers to me it looked like there were three sizes a very large pair and then two smaller pairs although the smaller pairs were still much larger than my husbands foot even with his shoe on you could see 5 toes and the arches in the foot i doubt that they could be anything else but this worrys me because i have an 11 month old baby in the house and my husband leaves for work at 3:30 a.m It was dark, about 10pm  It's hair was long on it's arms and on it's face the animal was about 10 feet away and still managed to run off  I did not make the mental connection to the scream we heard and the creature I had seen a few years prior until I saw your show and heard your team members calling out to bigfoot  I watched, in utter shock, hands shaking and unable to move as he simply vanished into the fog and darkness Over the years I often wondered if the Creatures with large red eyes were keeping protective watch over my dad I stayed in the tent and replayed the events that just happened over and over becoming more and more convinced that what I saw were actually 2 Bigfoot creatures They seen enough of the creature to describe it as being a huge, white furry creature on two feet instead of four It was down on it's hands and feet doing something! It saw me at the same time I saw it, it stood up and we looked at each other for a few seconds (it seemed like forever) then it ran one way and I ran the other way At the time of this sighting, we had never heard of a big foot So we stopped and looked around when we spotted on the North bank of the Forked Deer River two sets of large red eyes We sighted a very tall hairy creature My dad (who has since passed away in 2002) and I are the only ones in the car who were able to spot what we believe was a bigfoot We could not see anything when we got to the area this  being had crossed due to darkness  It stood a foot taller than the opening of the barn door Of course no one has ever really believed this story, but ever since I have had a huge interest in big foot and crytozoology. The forest here was extremely thick overhead and it was very dark at this point The bigfoot saw us and actually didn’t seem to care that we were watching it I froze and all the hair on my body stood straight up Saw a large brown/black mostly black animal in the middle of the woods and it stood about 7-7 1/2 ft tall and we did not hear it but it just sneaked up on us and made me feel like the prey insted of the hunter It was covered in 5-8 inch long dark brown hair, about 7.5-8.5 feet tall, and was running on two legs! It passed right in front of me with lightening speed  As I rounded a curve and my eyes caught the filtered sunlight from the clearing, I observed a large ape-like creature jump from the woods and pounce at something on the ground  Since there were no prominent breasts and the genital area was covered with long hair, I'm assuming it was a male It was about 20-25 feet in front of my son and I  Then I noticed as we got closer that it was standing on two legs and was furry all over I got a better reference to where the eyes were and I can tell you this, I couldn’t tell exactly how tall they were but after seeing the area in daylight the Creatures were very large We were walking back to the camp when out of the dark (in the direction the deer were looking) came a long call The trail itself was about 4 or 5 feet across I had herd weired screams at night and once during the day close to the house and it made the hair on my neck stand on end  As we rounded a turn, almost to our house, my headlights caught the eyes of what I thought was an animal"
Texas,"The sun was low and directly ahead of us, just above the rim of the creek bank which at this particular section were around 20 feet tall I asked my girlfriend did you see that, she said she saw a brown spot in the lights like a bear on two legs When I slowed to look more it ran into the wooded area fast, not on 4 legs My gut reaction is that she may have saw a Sasquatch, Bigfoot  Hair on the animal had somewhat of a ""combed or groomed"" look  It was tall, hairy, had large feet, and it was extraordinarily fast for it’s size Large footprints in sand We have always been interested in Bigfoot The trail down to the river was about ten feet to our left beside a 6-foot tall fence So he ran down to the creek to get the bait then he came running back and screaming and said that he saw a giant white hairy thing picking up leaves and droping them I saw a dark colored upright figure, like a ""big"" man run across the road My blood ran cold and every hair on my body stood on end We saw nothing when we did so we left the lights on and ran back in to finish locking up and then got back in the car, before we left we turned the car off and sat in the dark for about 10 min  It must have been 7 or 8 foot tall It was about 6 ft tall dark, burnt orange hair all over its body, it ran slowly across the road into woods So I stopped and surveyed my surroundings and to the east of me about 25yds in the thick underbrush something quite robust in size and dark in color seemed to be crouched between a couple of trees looking in my direction I was convinced it was not human because no one would be walking around barefoot, and mainly because of that arch. Bear have never been spotted anywhere in this region so it didn't take long for the frightening realization to set into to me that this might be a bigfoot  I would say that it was relatively tall and was standing on its hind legs as I got closer to it and as it raced across the street in front of us No one came, so the next morning came I found myself looking for anything on the ground, no foot prints due to carpet grass that was pretty thick They were about 20 feet from the compressor steps, on the other side of the fence by the creek The individual remembered seeing a dark upright figure with long hair standing in the middle of the road I ran to my guest room to look out the window facing that direction; and back towards northwest, I saw something huge and dark in color going across my neighbor's back pasture, moving fast It was just getting dusk when me and my mom, now on the opposite side of the road from my dad, began to hear footsteps in the water The hair stood up on the back of my neck We went back out in a bit and I got my Qbeam out and panned the tree line till I was beside the house and they hollered stop, LOOK and there were the eyes again beside the house in woods It stopped Twice and looked in my direction.A ice cold feeling shot down to my legs When we were about to put our boats back in the water my friend yells for me to look at something and we came upon a series of unusual footsteps that looked non human but bigger then any other animal that is in this area I thought it might be a cow but when I focused on it, it stood up slowly on two legs, appeared to be very tall, and took three or four really long, liquid, and smooth steps to get behind a nearby mesquite tree David and myself walked the creek when we came across a barefoot foot print that was much larger than any grown man I then asked did it look like it was on two legs running up right As I looked across I saw a dark hairy animal, or something, running on two legs like a human Whatever anyone thinks about a bigfoot being out there, I don't care If I was 20 seconds later I would have hit a man that had hair covering his whole body except I could see his mouth and nose with no hair; the eyes were pretty clear of any facial hair also I would estimate it to be no more than 6ft.tall.The hair on my neck stood up when I heard movement of something large moving in woods from accross the trail behind me Local residents had spoken of a ""wild man"" that jumped fences and made loud yells but I assumed that if the stories were true, they were referring to some mentally ill human I was watching them then out of the corner of my eyes I seen something walking on 2 feet I pulled my rifle up to look through the scope and seen it was big and brown At between 100-150 yards away I had my cross hairs right on its chest When it got to the tree line it stepped over a 5 strand barbed wire fence almost in stride This thing was at least six foot five or taller and bigger than me My Dad doesn't believe in Bigfoot but my brother is disabled and sits up outside on the patio every night He said that he wasn't sure that it was a bigfoot but it was at least 6.5 feet tall, very broad and covered with hair The ""head"" was very large and hairy Years ago I had heard the scream of the bigfoot which is something you don't forget. The only physical evidence was about 20 Mesquite trees which has been broken about three feet from the ground and some deep indentions in the ground. So if it wasn't a bigfoot, fine I just don't really know what it was and big and hairy myself!!)  So she admitted her perception of Bigfoot is like 8 or 9 feet- maybe he is, maybe he isn't- I don't claim to know They had BIG heads, the eyes were dark looking despite the growing darkness and flashlights I know exactly where it crossed and I have asked my husband to go and look for foot prints  We were stepping over a log when I noticed what looked like a footprint in the ash  The hair was not very long  Again he seemed to be about six and a half feet tall, kind of sloped up the back It was longer on the arms (which hung to the knee) and covered its (hands ?) If bigfoot exists, this is what I saw Tom ran around the house to retrieve the football and his dog followed after him I was shining my light in the trees looking for eyes and heard what sounded like someone fall in the water covered in light hair head was gray hair It went from sounding far away to ten feet with out making a sound in the heavy brush Down on my knuckles I am on 3 feet tall On 3-4-22, about 9:20 P.M., I get a text from her while sitting in my recliner while she was in the bathtub that she sees red eyes outside the bathroom window looking at her! I wait for her to finish getting out of the bath to talk to her I heard something like foot steps but they sounded like a very heavy person taking huge steps, but not running It was completely covered in hair that was redish-brown in color The eyes were yellowish in color with large black iris's with no white that I could see heavy eyebrows, yellow eyes with red in them Now I stand six foot even and weigh 250 lbs For a few brief seconds we stared at each other then suddenly the creatures turned to its right and took one step and went crashing through the trees which shook even the very tallest trees and sent the birds panicking into flight Me and Tom were playing football in the front yard of his house at dusk one evening when I kicked the football over the roof of his house It looked to be covered with 6 to 8 inch hair After interacting and watching for a year I notice the hair color changes with the season As I got closer the one thing that really got my attention was the eyes I saw no face, and do not remember seeing arms or feet - but I did see an upright something about six feet tall leap ten feet across the trail and spring into the woods That was the point when they no longer thought i was just a weird Dad who believes in Bigfoot The fences in this area range from 3 1/2 feet to 4 foot tall  I could not identify the animal, only movement and a dark hairy head Most recently, a teenage boy saw a bigfoot in the same Woodville, TX area It was dark black, had long arms, running way too fast for a person, black fur, 7 to 8 feet tall, wide shoulders, had a long neck  We looked back and saw a large, dark, hairy creature standing right behind the back fence of the cemetery -- maybe 50 yards away It was not a wild pig because it was clearly crouched down on two legs and using its arms and hands to roll the rocks  All I could hear was the footsteps of the horses, and she and I talking  It was on my girlfriend's side of the truck about 10 feet away and she said its hands were long and the thumbs were 'not right' It was about 5 1/2 to 6 feet tall, moving upright, in the same direction that we were traveling I went over in my head all night long trying to convience myself it was someone playing a joke in an ape suit, but they would have had to be widest person I have ever seen, with long arms Around 1995 while checking my cattle about 10PM I encountered a rather large man like animal (look to be about 8 ft tall) in my light and he went one way and I the other Now we are convinced we crossed paths with a Bigfoot. The individual swerved to miss the figure and came as close as twenty feet before veering off the highway and rolling the car  Upon further investigating I discovered a 5 foot long stick about 1 1/4 in diameter-rigid, with a sharp end on it, and the end of it had deer hair and flesh on it, like it was used to either stab the deer or just to hold it down, then it broke the deers neck, the kill was made from the waters edge side not the woods side, meaning the thing that killed the deer was hiding in the water...I also discovered tracks some were 19 inches long but were not castable, not enough definition, also found some tracks that were 14 inches long, and some 11 inches long along the shoreline down from the kill site, all of them were not castable it had also been raining that whole week off and on As i took off, it seemed to move away as well but it was 40-50 feet below me in the hollow I must have stood there stock still for a solid 20 count just staring at this shape when I got the shock and, frankly, the fright of my young life!  The damned thing stood up and ambled off into the woods!  Down into a streambed and up the other bank off into the forest to be exact!  It looked just exactly like a very large man wearing a solid dark fur parka pulled up over it's head only there's just no way it was a dude in a coat - there was no variation in clothing, no lines, waving flapping wrinkling nothing The face itself was basically hairless around the nose, cheeks and only a small amount of hair around the upper mouth It appeared to be hairy  They were tall trees about 10 feet tall  The only thing that I clearly remember is that the eyes were big and black It stood straight up in the fork of the tree with it arms down to its side The head was conical in shape and covered in a dark brown almost blackish hair about 4-5 inches in length She looked out the peephole and said it was to dark to see a thing, she then went to the window and looked out and screamed  Something just in front of me, in the total darkness, growled deeply and loudly back at me!  I was completely surprised and the first thing I thought was, ""That's weird, coyotes don't usually growl back at people!""  I wondered why this one was so brave and wasn't running off with the rest of them The creature was described as being ""gorilla-like"" in appearance, but very distinctly bipedal It's eyes reflected like glowing embers when the parking lights from my truck hit it My wife was sitting down on a makeshift chair and I was at the fire Today I accidentally found your site looking for something that had nothing to do with big foot Now I am a hog hunter, so I am used to seeing eyes until I was looking up at it  That was until I looked up and noticed this large creature in our creek area glancing in our direction by the swing - with glowing greenish-yellow eyes - as it quickly turned away and ran to the South, following the flow of our creek until it quickly disappeared Hair raising howls I was moving quite slowly because of the horrible weather when I slowed down even more because I saw a large ball of hair about the size of a large deer on the side of the road  About 300 yards up the hill we looked back & there stood in the middle of the road an extremely tall, brownish-red hair covered creature, standing on two feet like a man It was dark that night with very little light from the moon the best that I can remember. We shot several times when suddenly, a large animal lunged into the ravine in front of us only about 10 to 15 feet  I was out playing 50 yards from the trailer on the outside ring of a tall stand of large trees and about 250 yards from the edge of the forest In September of 2000 my wife and I found some extremely unusual rock formations in the Kiamichi Mountains of Oklahoma and in the course of our investigations were told of 6 bigfoots that lived in the area by a 98 year old resident All of a sudden it’s hand moved and a 2-3” diameter tree trunk about fifteen feet long came flying toward me  The only detail I could see was that the gray hair on it's back was thin and long, seeing skin underneath, and the hair was somewhat parted down the middle Part of it was exposed dirt, part covered in dry leaves.The footsteps were in the dry leaves The rubber bungie was hung on a tree limb (7 feet off the ground) by the hook We often go hiking on these trails with our children and she likes to point out, facetiously, Bigfoot nests and food sources The shoulders and arms were massive The dirt road was well packed so I couldn't see any footprints left behind My story does not seem to fit into what Matt, Cliff, and Bobo say is what seems to be normal Bigfoot behavior to me It was a rusty-red color, about six feet tall, and was extremely, extremely fast We looked at it and it was definitely a barefoot foot He stood about 7-8 foot tall After being there for 15-20 minutes I began noticing the sound of footsteps coming from my right down the hill After hunting that day, I was exiting the water onto the shore and looked to my right about 200 - 300 feet Approximately six feet in height; 3 All the neighboring dogs and mine went totally silent.their hair on their backs was raised and they were locked on something down hill The skin was very dark brown but not black and its palms were about the same color It was about 75 feet away and was hiding  behind a large oak tree These resembled a very large human foot in the dirt At midnight, we began to hear bipedal movement to our right about 40 yards away and a light breeze wafted an incredibly terrible smell towards us My son lives in the same house where I saw the bigfoot in Woodville, TX. We were facing towards the front yard, I was looking up when I noticed something move out of the corner of my eye, I looked and there was a creature around 5 foot tall running through the front yard, from left side of the yard to the right side, it was not large like most reports, it had muscle definition, black or dark brown hair, no neck ,no hair on the face, chest and stomach area, inside of the arms or palms of the hands It's chest and abdomen didn't seem to be as hairy and I could see it's eyes, nose, and mouth, so I assume they were not hairy either It walked 20 to 50 feet then descended into a ravine, it looked to go down on all four legs as it went into the ravine then it was gone I feel stupid doing this but my teacher told us in class the other day about his bigfoot experiences There was no reports of a Sasquatch, Bigfoot, or anything like that in 1963.  I am not too sure I do know it was quite a bit taller then myself We sat til after dark and continued to hear unexplainable noises at 7 feet high it was 4 feet wide When I get to the window she showed me approximately how high the eyes were off the ground and where they were positioned It was black and hairy all over It's eyes never left mine even when my sister came onto the porch I have never seen the panther but I have many times come up on something I assumed was the panther story but I never thought about a big foot theory till this morning I asked how far apart the eyes were, and from what she showed me, it came out to be about 6 inches apart I saw the fear in its eyes Further apart than our eyes are for sure I had just driven about 100 meters on a oil field lease road, when I spotted what I thought was a large Russian boar hog on the right side of the lease road about 75-100 feet in front of me I stood still and looked at the creature which was looking at me for about 30 seconds before I realized that the eyes and head was in the top section of the window and that I could not see the shoulders as they were outside of the window frame You could definitely make out that it was covered with hair, I say that because I didn't see any clothing and it was covered - no skin was showing  To many this will sound like a tall tale, but to me it was very vivid. I ran up to the edge of the water and about 100 feet on the other side I could barely see a black figure with a silver looking tint to its hair ,where it was standing the sun was shineing on it,I only saw it for about 30 or 40 seconds this last time.Whatever it was walked on 2 legs and was 6 foot tall or taller and moved through the woods quieter than anything I have ever seen,after it was on the other side of the creek it never made any noise.The ground was covered with oak leaves that were damp and a lot of undergrowth so I didnt see any footprints.I walk back to the blowdown where I had originaly seen it,and found where a large log had just been moved ,this log was probably 3 foot tall and maybe 20 foot long, although it was decaying it was to heavy for anyone I know to move.I figured I had interrupted a midmorning snack and then I questioned my own good judgement about going toward it when I first saw it.I get chils just writting this.I decided it was time for me to head back to the pickup it was one of the longest walks I have ever made.I had to go through some thick stands of switchcane,my heart was in my throat and I left my gun off of safety all the way back to the truck,thats something I have never done before,I pride myself in being safe with firearms,and have been hunting since I was 6 years olds.I told Glen and C.E As he came closer she could see he was huge, then she could see the hair he was covered with  My nephews reported hearing the running, and they saw one pair of glowing eyes 8-9 inches apart about 8 feet off the ground 20 yards from their boxed blind, and it scared them  There appeared to be thin facial hair surrounding the mouth, almost in a beard-like fashion It stood with a stoop and the arms were very long Had arms like an ape The ""nest"" was about 4 feet tall Why I say that is because the bottom of the window was 4 and a half feet from the ground and my brother is 5 foot 11 inches tall It was standing in tall grass so couldn't see below waist Her mother then called my place of work to have me come back to house to take a look around, as I first arrived, I noticed that there was some kind of bad odor in the area but as i keep looking around along with my coworker, who gave me ride back to my house, and my mother-in-law, on the east side of the house where there is no lights, we all heard something stepping on twigs or branches laying on the ground for the snapping and breaking noise that it makes, as I attempted to walk towards the noise, whatever was there seemed to move farther back into the woods out of reach of my flashlight, after looking around we went to ask my sister-in-law if she could say who or what she had seen in the window, all she could say was that it was ""big, black, hairy"" and something about its eyes, she is really talkative all of the time but after that happened she looked liked she was in shock her face was pale and her eyes seemed to liked she was lost.  The only thing close to it I've every heard was on some Bigfoot vocalizations I'd heard on the Internet Now the angle that the eyes were in window, was perfectly in line to look through that plant I mentioned to examine my wife in the bathtub His face was as tall as the speeding sign that he was standing next to as if he was crossing the road  We then heard 2 sets of bipedal footsteps running away from us to our left over the ridge towards my nephews In the film, they played a sound that they swear is a big foot yelling It looked to be about seven ft.tall The animal dropped to all fours, bunched up its rear legs and leaped We believe that it was a bigfoot looking for his meal I turned to look out the driver-side window of my car, when I looked straight into the dark face of a very large, man-like, hairy creature which had hunched down to stare at us described the creature as being 8 to 9 feet tall, covered with the exception of the face with reddish-brown hair I climbed out of my deer stand at about 9:30 because we had to look for a deer my cousin had shot late the evening before that we could not find because of the thick brush and darkness I estimate that it was 10 feet from me or so when it took one last step I was certain that it had to be Bigfoot The face had no hair on it Appeared bipedal and upright; 5  it ran with a gate that i have never seen and it was not human at all, it was about 9 feet tall and its strides were about that long Hairy face made features small He had come home with tells of bigfoot As we approached the fire lane, the underbrush became dense except for one opening about 100 feet wide But I did tell the others and asked them to take me to where I had seen the ape like creature and let me out to see if I could see any footprints  The witness raised his weapon and observed through his scope what appeared to be a large, gorilla-like animal standing very still, arms down by its side This vegetation started a few feet from the water and extending two thirds of the way back up the bank  My son said they were going approx 20 miles an hour and he could hear loud footsteps keeping pace with the 4-wheeler As we started watching, whatever it was started jumping around, waving its arms like it was trying to get our attention I got back up and shined lite and eyes were gone, but could hear it moving thru treeline next to me Time was roughly between 7:00 and 7:30 we were coming back from laredo on hwy 131 Up ahead we both noticed a large hairy creature moving across the road The next sound was that of a bigfoot  Through it they saw the light of the open refrigerator with a six-foot-tall-plus being silhouetted in front of it, apparently drinking a bottle of ketchup The footprints were about an inch to an inch and a half deep and about fifteen or so inches in length So when you get to this point you have to pick the boat up and carry it about 50 feet until you get over it, then sit the boat back down, hop in, and take off Our youngest son used to watch those goofy BIG FOOT shows to where my wife and I would offhandedly snicker to one another at his fervent belief in something so obviously fake A small creek ran a few feet north of where it (the creature or ?) was Its hair looked 5 inches long on the head to the neck area and 8 inches on the body  Its hair was not really long, about an inch or so and the hair did not cover the face  The witness described the animal as having rather thin hair on its body, but the hair almost had the appearance of being combed or groomed It was almost dark and I couldn't see too well, but I did stop there just past the second bridge heading east Then it HIT me, this is a Bigfoot  It ran away with what sounded like a long heavy stride which faded away quickly in the distance in the same direction it came from Although stooped on one knee, it was as tall as my car It was on two legs and stooped over A 7-foot upright stooped ape like figure, dark brown in color At this time, it stood up on it's hind legs and looked directly at me and growled at me as if it were a wolfman like in the old 50's movies.Then it ran on its hind legs like a human being, but faster than anything I've ever seen in my life; across the road in front of me, and into a tree line I am now leaning towards hearing the footsteps of a person and not a deer It was an animal in the form of a man, all dark haired, blackish or dark dark brown A large hairy creature unlike any thing I have ever seen before, stood up right like a person, but was NOT a person A member of our party noticed someone moving around on a rock ledge up on the cliffs about 250-300 feet above the river Even talking about it makes my hair stand up  I know Texans are known for telling tall tales but so help me this is true Once they were in the bottem of the creekbed they both looked up the creekbed in the direction the footsteps had came from This bull has 4-6 inch long, bleached out strawberry blonde, matted hair hanging just above mid-point on him I still see the whites of its eyes so clearly in my mind It was beginning to get dark at this time It was only about 30 feet from me, I could see it's breath in the cold night air The ground was not conducive of any kind of foot print. It was very dark over there because we have no light over there Huge chest and shoulders, long arms and no neck,it ran with incredible speed..in 3 long strides it covered from the trees across the road in front of us and into the right side tree line which is 30 ft I was 50 feet or less away from it I couldn't see any eyes shining in my flashlight beam either  Then he asked me to read some of the articles on a bigfoot website and the same fear came over me and couldn’t believe other people were describing what I saw back then. Definitely not a black bear! It appeared trim and muscular, with it's long arms hanging down past it's knees I am a little unsure if this is a Bigfoot sighting or not but it certainly freaked me out enough that I felt the urge to look into a bit further As I got closer it stood on its hind legs and started to walkng towards me on the left side of the road (walking from East to West) I did not do so earlier because I simply had no idea there was a possiblilty this could have been a bigfoot-type animal I would estimate the animal at seven feet tall, long thick arms, thick chest, long red hair (the color of an Irish Setter dog) I'm not convinced Bigfoot exists because I need to see it but my wife believes and she suggested I report it to you guys I checked my brakes and started to turn around but then thought what am I doing, thinking my eyes and the early hour of the morning were playing tricks on me and continued on to Gatesville It had hair on it - kinda long and dark  I never even considered that it would have been a bigfoot, never entered my mind The distance from my hunting spot to the spot where I believed it fell and came out to be 11 feet It was around 5 to 5:15 in the morning, but still so dark that I could not see my hand in front of my face When in the light of the moon standing across from him on the otherside of the pond was a bigfoot I am now 37, and have since learned to not be afraid anymore, because I can still see it's eyes in my mind, those whites of its eyes, the fear in its eyes Im talking about 200 feet.I did not want to find out what was there so I turned around and came home  The expression on it’s face was surprise and the eyes followed me and I drove within 15 to 20 feet of it, as I drove by I turned my head and looked out the window Hair long about 5-6 inches It looked at me, then turned so I could not see its eyes anymore, and it walked like a human into the creek He said that he saw a very tall hairy creature lifting this boar hog over the pallet fence The rope was about 10 feet long At first I thought it was a cow, but then we noticed all the night sounds were gone, no frogs, crickets, owl - dead quiet except the foot steps While hunting in east Texas I saw a large hair covered, 7 ft tall, 275 lb The thing ran off but not far I could hear its foot steps in the leaves it was then I walked back to tell my buddies and get help Just wanted to acknowlege that myself & my sister sighted a bigfoot, or what looked like one in the 60s in East Texas at my grandparents home in the Piney woods We looked around for just a few minutes and had to return to the truck - it was getting dark in a hurry and we were largely unequipped. I watched my rearview mirror and all I could see was something big and dark standing on two legs come into the road behind me I found absolutely no hair on any of it The next year I was in Bigfoot's backyard walking very slow & quiet listening for squirrels  The thing I remember most though was the eyes It was getting dark but the fish were biting good, so we sat there a little longer catching fish I felt like the hairs on my neck were standing up well we got to the spot and nothing just a patch of hair on the barb wire fence now with that in mind the fence stood about 4 1/2 feet high Bears have not been known to climb barbwire fences nor have they been seen in that part of the country for a long time middle of the road in about 4 easy strides and left the same way It jumped from one rock ledge to another that was 15 feet away and 20 feet or so down I was totally hysterical, I've never been ""out of it like that before or since"", I was so scared, I just wanted to be away from there If you knew him, you would realize how totally out of character this is for him we sat out on the road in lawn chairs  It was black in color but it had what looked like mud on its legs and arms I was probably 30 or 35 feet away and the brush and undergrowth in the slash was pretty thick.After I whistled the movement stoped and I could see a large dark colored figure moving toward the creek at an angle away from me, my hair on the back of my neck stoud up and I had a feeling that I had never felt before.This had never happened to me before while I was hunting.I was still thinking to myself it may be somebody ,but I still took my 3006 off of safety and walk toward what ever it was I lost site of it in the underbrush and then picked it up again on the other side of the creak.The creak in this area was about 12 or 14 feet wide,I never heard any sound of anything hitting the water  I noticed out of my peripheral vision what looked to be a very tall and very thick butt of a bull Other reports indicate subjects shielding their eyes from bright lights at night, but this guy was simply rotating his body with no other obvious motion I remember my father telling my about bigfoot and that he and some friends had seen something he could not identify as a boy in West Virginia. It had hair that stood up on top of its head  This was no man and damn sure not a bear.It had to be at least 8 to 8 1/2 feet tall and weight no less than 500.bs We went to the cabin and saw several more of the footprints going in a circle around the cabin My wife has not been a believer but going off of the things that she has heard and now seen with her own eyes, she just might have changed her mind. This was no hog! I decided to play a trick that I have used before on game in thickets and throw a two foot section of a dead limb over and beyond the sounds hoping to flush it out to my side It ran so fast with long strides  Just beyond the light of the porch, at the edge of the darkness near my driveway gate lined with shrubs, I yelled once more I turned toward the pasture and there was this tall, lean, lanky, hairy mannish thing coming toward me My pickup and trailer are a total of 65 feet long so it was pretty easy to figure the distance to him It stood very tall well over 8 feet I was in a 18 wheel Mack truck and this thing stood so tall as to look at me eye to eye.I've worked in the oil field for years and I've seen hogs of all sizes and breeds.Thousands of deer, and even black panthers.But this was something different, almost un-natural Several years ago, I watched a documentary about Big Foot I sat there thinking what was that, I was quiet for a while, I didn't want to say anything and sound crazy, hey i just saw a Bigfoot That road is dark and there were no cars that night for some reason I stand 6 feet 1 inch tall; all I could see was a shadow of something that made me look small MOM: No, it sounds like it's walking on two feet, cause a deer has four legs and you’ll be able to hear them  At that time, I never thought of Bigfoot I never saw one, but if a bear can walk on two legs thru a creek and turn and walk up the embankment on two legs, then I saw a bear I know the ecology doesn't seem to fit the habitat of a bigfoot but I just can't figure out what it was DESCRIPTION: 7 to 8 foot tall My wife had heels on! I walked on ahead, probably thirty feet ahead of my wife The only thing we found was a small stand of sapplings with their tops broken about 5-1/2 feet above the ground about 200 yards East of our camp I fully cocked my 30-30 rifle and pointed it in the direction of the footsteps She said the lights reflected off of it and its eyes were glowing red from the porch lights reflection I’m 6ft tall and going off where she said the eyes were, I estimated them to be around 6ft 8 to 7ft off the ground One of the edges had coarse hair like a coyote's I got up and heard some movement below my bedroom window, which is about 6 feet above the ground  His arms were down to it's side and appeared longer than ours It was completely covered with hair Its fur or hair was brownish-red, like very dark and old dead pine needles  What I saw had shinny reddish hair and was like 7 to 8 feet high It had redish brown hair all over its body About that time they noticed a huge white haired figure standing about 30 or so yards from the fire It appeared to have long hippie like hair and somewhat of a beard Just after dark I decided to go to the park for some night fishing  I am facing the road and looking into the thicket ahead,  and  60 to 80 feet from my car in the thicket I see what I first thought was the haunches of a horse moving around I could only see the top part It ran like a man, arms in the same position a man runs like, not hanging to his sides but in a jogging position I could see it was very dark in color and almost lying in a prone position much like a sniper lining up a shot it and human like legs only very hairy I could make out thick arms and shoulders also covered with thick hair probibly no more 1-2"" in length It seemed to be no more than 20 feet from us All the hair on my neck and arms stood up before I even heard a sound Its hands and feet looked human like but they were very large We got to the bank where it dropped off a couple of feet and found the line (it had been marked with a red piece of cloth around the tree by it) It had a very large head, large eyes and very long thick hair  There were missing patches of hair on the arms and legs Down the thicket about 50 to 75 yards there was a little opening about 30 feet across, this thing crossed the opening That afternoon it was starting to get dark but still light enough to see I started back towards my nephews stand Was on two feet upright I saw two shoulders and the back of the head go between two trees, later measured to be about 4.5 feet apart I sat up and turned on the headlights and saw a very large creature standing about six feet from the front of my truck It was 7 to 8 feet tall, with long gray hair I was looking out the window and saw this big black figure running fast on two legs They go out there by themselves, they pick bigfoots backyard to hunt in  Two men Lawyer Henry and another fellow were quail hunting along a fence line near the Trinity River (A swamp, tall old oak, hickory and pecan.)  They saw a very large 9' tall brown/black creature burst from the very thick brush carrying a calf Its color was a color I can only say looked like a dark grayish brown not unlike a coyote I noticed a swarm of flies boiling around something on the opposite side of the trench from the footprint I never spoke of Bigfoot until that point and they were the ones making the connection We looked out the window and saw a big, hairy animal and my grandfather knocked the screen out of the window and shot The color reminds me most of all like the eyes of a cat in color The adrenalin kicked in, I checked my gun, put some trees between myself and this thing and proceded to try and get closer, peering around the trees every few feet to see if it was still there  The told me of a large, humanoid white ape creature with long arms walking a cow trail The footsteps kept getting closer I was traveling about 80mph,so I passed it rather fast, this dark object rose up to a standing position and took a leap into the darkness Within the next minute or less there were heavy footsteps quite near the tent, then a very quiet mis-step in some loose gravel; there followed a quiet grunt/growl There is no doubt in my mind what I had encountered was a bigfoot in the thicket This horse had a long mane and I noticed it standing part way out like it was charged by static electricity, and the hair on my arms and back of my neck were standing up too I never really believed there were bigfoot, if so why has no one found a body or bones, or God forbid shot one of these beings I could see a large brown hairy object hiding behind a cedar tree On opening day, (evening) I was hunting in my stand that was closest to the creek.(I would later find this was close to the bigfoot's nest area) Whenever I turned back around there was a large humanoid creature, approximately 6 – 6.5 foot tall, broad shouldered and thick in appearance, with either dark brown or black hair covering its entire body It was near dark I was interested in this subject of bigfoot for a long time The creature was about seven to eight feet tall As I got to my bedroom door, my cat was laying in my rocking chair next to my door It stood up and moved away very rapidly on it's two ""hind"" legs I remember telling my grandfather when I first saw it to look at that horse walking on its hind legs It was in October and almost dark when I heard this growl (if you can call it that!) I mean four foot steps We went out to the pond and were standing around when I looked into the woods and saw a black hairy creature standing there watching us Let me first start by saying that when I opened my new issue of Texas Fish and Game, it opened right to the page with the picture of the ""creature"" on it, and the hairs stood on my head At the suggestion of a bigfoot hunter from Sulphur, Oklahoma, I left a small hand mirror and some dried fruit in a plastic bag at my dig site, but nothing ever disturbed them This thing? was about 81/2 to 9 feet tall,solid black,and covered ground in a way I have never seen Several Bigfoot were observed with binoculars in a deeply wooded area We headed across it and stopped in the center of the bridge to look at the river scenery when we spotted a huge dark figure on the river wading in the water around ankle deep We have seen ""nests"" in the tall grass behind the house and under the big pecan tree in front of the house We hot footed it back home and found the dog waiting for us there, under his house and not too willing to be moved My buddy, who is still my best friend, saw something big and hairy trotting upright on two legs, crossing the road ahead of us I knew that it was not a person my father is 6'3 and that creature was much taller and more broad shouldered I didn't take my eyes off of him for more than 2 seconds, but that was all he needed When I looked toward the door there was a 4 foot thing covered in a ruddy reddish brown fur The thing was at least 7 foot tall and covered in hair it was still completely dark I did not notice any footprints on the ground around the window or handprints on the house  As I backed out of the driveway my lights caught the attention of a very big creature about 9 foot tall grayish blonde in color with a 4 to 4 1/2 ft across from shoulder to shoulder, standing in front of an oak tree, it turn towards me from about 40 yards away, and it stood with its arms down at it's side, I asked my son to look and I looked away briefly, when I looked back it was gone We had got in the woods late, so I walked in about 30 feet (off the road) and sat on a stump I would start to work about dark and finish up right before daylight or sometimes a little earlier I seen eyes light up from my hard hat light Wished I would have been older...we could have gotten all kind of footprints in the field  At this time, through the use of the rifle scope, the witness was able to observe the animal as though from a distance of only 25 - 30 feet After dark in total darkness, we heard objects being thrown thru wooded area at us This thing was about eye level if not taller and twice as wide as I was at the time Sometimes it would let me know it was there, and if it was, all was totally silent, nothing moving It was about 7 feet tall and it looked to be about 500lbs it disappeared into the woods to the left of my neighbors pasture and I didn't see it again I know the people that hunt over there and they are all around 6 foot and no where as big as this was. The sun was setting and it was starting to get dark I had taken maybe 2 or 3 more steps when the hairs on my neck literally stod on end and to this day I swear I heard a 'woofing' noise I could see most of its body, it was huge, standing on two legs, slowly looking around the tree at the hogs Couldn't see whole thing because it was behind the trees, just eyes blinking in the bright light Although I was staring right at the creatures face I could barely see its' eyes due to the extreme amount of hair On the afternoon of January 5th 2001, I discovered several footprints in the Yellow House Canyon of Lubbock Texas As I walked back to my truck, watching my back, I knew where he had been standing and that there was probably footprints and knuckle prints there that I could take pictures of, I had my camera with me, and I’d have proof to show my family of what I saw MOM: Listen closely; whatever it is is walking on two legs coming this way The face was devoid of hair About 50 feet from the end of our trot-line there ran a gravel bed along the rivers bottom from one bank to the other I am sorry, but I can't say with certainty that what I saw was a bigfoot, but I can say with certainty that what I saw was: 1  The hair was wrong and too long for a bull It had a wide, slouching, pear-shape body with long legs It turned, jumped right over my barbed wire fence and started running humped over or on all fours, across the tall grass pasture next to my driveway  and it was getting dark so we headed in and angrily decided to do it in the morning These trees were short (approximately 5-10 feet), and spread far apart What I saw is difficult to explain but you know how a skiers legs look them they are crouched, it was like that, like a spring compressing the knees to unleash power One of our football coaches insisted it was a cougar The information shown recently on a History Channel show about a curious Bigfoot motivated me to send this Very wide shoulders, his upper arms were very long, linear and powerful looking Seen big dark something twice He said it stood at least 8 maybe 9 foot tall and that it could step over a fenceline I have never seen a cow clear that much distance even at a dead run, I know deer can but this animal (creature) was upright and I could clearly see the motion of the arms like it had made a running jump Found footprints next day, but did not have a camera to take photos.Guessing that it would weigh around 450 to 500 pounds, very mobile, jumped a 4' fence with ease.  Height was estimated to be between eight to nine feet tall I did notice that it was a very dark night with no moon so anything outside the truck lights was just black He stood on two feet like a human with long arms and didn't run but was lumbering across the road I saw a bigfoot in my backyard 26 2011, I seen its eyes on the other side of the fence that is at least 9-10 feet high They were on 2 feet a step and a drag step like it had a hurt foot or something I weigh 230lbs and it was at least twice my size! It's hair was a really dark brown and not as long as I thought it would be As I drove up to the turnoff, it ran back (on 2 legs) into more trees, toward my parents home Me, my mom, and my sister were driving home from a friends house down a dirt road when a tall lurky creature dashed across the road I told them I just had seen a bigfoot but they tried to explain it away as a cow or deer The sounds got louder and louder and eventually started to sound like footsteps of someone walking in the same direction they were going He ""looked"" upset.Clearly not sure what it was that my son and I saw but it was a man like being that was as tall as the street sign It got dark fast and all I had was a small flashlight I found that part of my barbed wire fence on the back of my property was pulled down about a foot in a place that might have been a scuff mark in the ground where it might have stepped as it went over the fence but nothing definite that would have stood up to any sort of official investigation The one we were sure was a male would watch us from the pine trees about 250 yards away but we saw him good enough to see he was about eight feet tall very broad in the chest and had tall sloping forehead On one occasion he told us the creature was bouncing a limb up and down with its arms one night in the light of their headlights and they measured the height of the limb the next day and he said he couldn't even reach the limb It sped up walking and I remember its arms really swung as it walked and it seemed like its legs never straightened out, not bow legged but with knee slightly bent The footsteps at one point sounded as if whatever was moving the same direction was no more than 25 feet away I'm going back this year, but I hope I don't see the bigfoot again. It looked at me again and then ran around the side of the bus, it was as tall as the bus but skinny, but it was dark so not sure  It was very dark by now, and I turned on my flashlight and moved into the woods to try to see what was making the sounds I think it was around 7 feet tall Coming around a corner, my sons friend said the lights from the 4-wheeler picked up ""glowing eyes"" about 7 feet above the ground that my sons friend saw What could be seen, indicated the size around 16 inches.The missing section of pipe was located about 50 feet away in some ceders  It didn't seem as tall as I would have imagined.. My wife jumped from her chair sideways and ran to the shed spraining her ankle in the process It stood at least seven feet tall and possibly taller, was covered in dark brown or reddish brown hair Its eyes almost like it was curious me like I was of it When I got there he took me around to the back of his house and there in a muddy area by his sister’s bedroom window were large footprints I have never believed in Big Foot but I can tell you this is not anything I have ever seen in my 53 years of life! When I got to work this morning I shared what I had seen with co-workers It was definitely upright and on 2 thick legs Shots from a .45ACP handgun were fired in the vicinity followed by heavy footsteps and branches/brush being disturbed by the same heavy animal making a hasty retreat ""He"" was easily 7 foot tall She looked over to the window and saw the red eyes looking at her about mid way up the window  It could not have been a horse or cow and no goat was heavy enough to produce the foot sounds that I heard It was dark in color, but everything was either light or dark because of the red filter It was already getting dark They were not believers in Bigfoot, but that got them talking about the possibilities It eyes were big and brown, very soft and thoughtful like it was working things out I feel privileged to have what I know must have been a Bigfoot encounter, even if it left an indelible mark I saw a large creature that was fairly tall and dark I had never heard anything like the chattering we heard that night that made our hair stand up I have been a believer in Bigfoot for years due to stories I’ve heard from certain people and things I’ve heard in the woods in past experiences  Last night (Friday, June 23, 2017) I saw a very large and tall “thing” in our backyard, and it would seem to have been the being otherwise known as (dare I say it?) BIG FOOT! I’m sure it sounds crazy, but it’s true When we started hearing footfalls behind us, very heavy footfalls I was almost 6 foot tall then and had a pretty good judge of the distance and relative size It was dark, hair covered and slowly moving its head around looking in the direction of the hogs Two wks before my Dad was putting his trash in the can and happened to feel someone watching him and he looked up to see in the moonlight (full moon) dead on straight away about 20 ft from him a tall 8ft brownish figure looking at him As we were leaving the area, we heard very heavy footsteps and stomping along with tree branches crashing to the ground that I likened to a bull dozer without the engine rushing behind us Bears do not move great distances on their hind legs, and especially not rapidly  And having done research before hand I know in ape footprints there is an arch in the middle, which this print did have  The friend said that he didn't see great detail other than the ""glowing eyes"" and a bushy or hairy face I declared the woods still had bigfoot & few deer and I wasn't returning anymore As soon as he got in, we slowly started to pull forward...Then, from our left out of the pine thicket came this HUGE thing, about 8 1/2 to 9ft tall,and very dark brown almost black hair 3 to 4 inch long It was tall and black, definitely not any of the previously mentioned animals It was completely dark by now, and overcast We looked on the road and found two sixteen inch long foot prints in the soft silt She was busy dealing with a slimey, slithery something that slithered across her foot  as we got to the sandy bank of the Canadian river we saw a bigfoot standing there about 100 yards down river from us i was driving south bound on hwy 37 from bogata texas at about 1am with my girlfriend and another friend headed toward mount vernon texas.Hwy37 there is a what i call a wide 2 lane road (it is 2 lanes but has a wide shoulder lane on both sides) when i saw something in my peripheal vision moving fast.i didnt slam on my brake but took my foot off the gas pedal thinking oh ****  a deer but when it came out of the ditch it lept into the middle of the road and was now in full view of our bright lights i realized it was no deer!it was big black and long haired landed in full stride and it was then when it launched its self not straight across the road but angled back toward us I saw its eyes then.  They were driving the 4-wheelers up to the camp spot after dark This lease was surrounded by two creeks these creaks  ranged from 12 to 24 feet wide and had been drug out by beavers which made them 7 foot deep and deeper in places.You will understand why Im giving you all this info in a few minutes  But it did match several legends of an albino ape in the area -- one of which, Hugo's Monster, is a totally ficitious, Frankenstein-genre tale At the time, no one around there had even heard of a bigfoot, so it was hard to explain Your show was the 1st time I heard of Bigfoot actually being discussed widely  I was totally confused on what I might be seeing Not being a bigfoot follower at that time, it never crossed my mind to be scared The absence of footfalls or other noises initially made me think it must have not been a sasquatch, but on reflection, the visitor could easily have frozen in his spot when he discovered our camp and then moved slowly away, perhaps using fallen logs, 15 minutes later once we were back to sleep As we neared the end of the road, within sight of the farm-road, a large, solid-black animal came out of the woods on the east side of the road, walking slowly on two legs It had huge long arms, which one arm hit the ground to help it move faster 4-2016 coming in from nearest town approaching a bridge repair so I slowed down and it was 7:15 on a clear evening I saw standing in a clearing a huge dark reddish brown figure in the tree line The midbody was short compared to the legs, which were long, arm down to the kneecaps What really caught my eye was that it had a really big head covered with long bushy hair  So like 3 of us went back down there to see what he was talking about and as we were walking along the creek a big hairy white man like thing jumped out from behind a tree in front of us, looked at us then jumped the creek (which is far too wide for the average human to jump) and ran off. My wife actually saw the form of a large animal walking upright and very tall crossing the road And a few days after the event I was out back and I looked into the feild and saw something large walking on two hind legs I would guess about 100 meters away The dad was never aware he was stalked by bigfoot, climbed up in the tree and didn't see anything out of the ordinary I have nothing to gain from this and frankly don't care what anyone says, I know what I saw and I am now a believer that bigfoot is real, no doubt what so ever...... We saw this large hairy, Chubaka-like creature walk across the road in front of us near Bon Wier,TX  He always thought it was a teen-age hermit, and when I asked why, he said he just had the feeling it wasn’t an adult, and what else could it be?  I asked what kind of clothes it wore, jeans, overalls, or ?  He said he couldn’t see the clothes because it was totally covered with long dark hair, about 4-6 inches long, all over, and he couldn’t see a face Near dark, I decided to walk the fire trail quietly It was a dark grayish white color and was walking at an angle away from us Hairy hands and feet We heard the ""thunk, thunk, thunk"" each time his foot came off the pedal I cleared the woods and turned to look and I could see something that had reddish-brown hair all over it Then it ran towards the dark area of the yard, it ran so fast no man can run that fast We jumped up, as the footsteps got closer The larger one(10 O'clock position) was at least 8 or 9 feet tall and was very massive in the shoulder areas She told us to look and it was over 7 feet tall because my boy friend is 6'5 it had long arms and very bulkey It was completely covered with hair, sort of a redish black looking color from what I could make out Had I been carrying my sidearm or a rifle, I would have done so, but not with a bow in complete darkness my mom and i where driving home from a friends house and we noticed a very large man crouched on the side of the road so we turned the car around to see if he needed help by the time we had returned he was gone so we continued on are way and about a quarter of a mile down the road we saw a very large thing cross the road in two steps it walked upright had very dark brown red shaggy fur and it had to have been 7.5-8 foot in hight after we witnesses this we where pretty spoked so we didn't stick around  he was sqwating on the side of the river and when we came up he was startled and jumped to his feet, but didnt run off There is a small canyon about 30 feet to the south of where he was  I could tell it wasn't a hooved animal by the sound the feet made when it walked Near dark, I heard what sounded like a large limb or small tree snap This thing looked to be 7-8 feet in height, was dark with hair, had a small head which looked like two orange, almost glowing, eyes, no resembalence of a neck, and very long, swaying arms, covered with hair about a foot long  I took several photographs of the footprints. The fur color, the legs bent, I would even entertain a deer having shaggier fur It was a Big Foot Even though they sounded very far off, the distinct heavy and slow footsteps made me to wonder what it was There standing on the other side of the pens was a 7 to 8 ft hairy creature My son still wonders what the noises were and I still get creeped out everytime I think about that night, something or someone was in those woods and took upon themselves to make noise because we had invaded that part of an unpopulated area, since that holiday night, I have heard others say they have heard people mention some sitings of bigfoot, but nothing substantiated  When her eyes caught mine, she lost it and began to scream bloody murder When we saw the creature, it was about eight feet tall and stood straight up with its back to us By then I realized that I had seen a bigfoot, sasquatch or what ever you want to call it 1st - Myself, my older sister and a friend of ours found a 16"" -20"" footprint by the pond at the back of the property my sister and her husband were renting She said it was brown with hair like grass, taller than her father but, she didn't see any eyes We saw it with all 3 cars headlights , it stood in ditch on right hand side of road .6Ft red eyes long red orange hair long arms. Sometime in the mid 1980's after a heavy rain with flooding, my baby brother found footprints where this animal had departed the water and walked around in the mud If at anytime it would have been on two legs (at 7 feet tall) I could have seen it clearly So I ran toward the fence waving my arms and yelling at the top of my lungs to try to scare it off It was tall, dark in color and walked up right It was dark and my wife and son saw something crossing the road in front of their van  We were about fifty feet from him when we realized it wasn't him It was a mostly wooded area but the thing was just off the road approximately 8 feet  I don’t remember skin color and I looked  to see it crouching there, big thick arms, legs and a look of surprise Bigfoot no idea, I am unsure what I saw, but it was intelligent As we came around a corner we watched what we believe to be a bigfoot cross the road All of a sudden from the left side of the field a huge man like creature that was covered in hair was running out of the woods across the field, it turned and looked up our way for a second then jump a barb wire fence (with no problem) I did not see the feet I immediately flanked to the downwind side of the opening hoping to either force this thing to drop the deer and run, push it into the opening where we could see it in the bright moonlight, or confront me in the tall, open timber where I would have a good clear shot  During this excursion, a large, hulking, hairy creature, approximately eight to ten feet tall appeared before them and roared, bearing its arms I turned to see a large red creature walking on two legs  He could also smell it from 20 feet or more, worse at closer range, and it really stunk, somewhat like a moldy skunk after going into creek bottoms, we found more footprints approx the same as before 6 1/2 to 7 foot tall, I am really not sure of the height because i was driving at 60 MPH but I could tell it was very broad, and with the headlights in its eyes they appeared to be sort of reflecting the lite, like a possum or coyote or other wild animals would do at night I was standing on the road and the water line was like 3-4 foot below the road This day I did not get in my deer stand, I took a chair and got in the woods (not sure how many yards in the brush) I have smelled that smell there several times after dark  Were were hunting a remote Texas Ranch at night with no light with the exception of a motion activated green light that would shine if an animal walked within 10 yards and 145 degree radius of the light standing 3 feet on a stick in the ground Glen's feet overlooked the drop off and he went over his head in water  About the second or third time this happened I noticed a low evergreen shrub (in the shadows of the woods even evergreens look kinda grey/brown or just darker than the surroundings) or at least a dark pear shape that I took to be like a small bushy cedar just inside the forest canopy - I thought something like ""that sure looks like a big person shaped bush   as it ran with its head towards us it just clobered a small tree right at the edge of tree line, as it did the tree broke and the bigfoot barely flinched  Coyotes don't have long hair like that did It was dark brown or black and was standing up next to a tree It was very shocking to see and watch a bigfoot  We sat down just before dark at 9PM and waited I remember reading about a white bigfoot in the Lake Worth area back in 1968-69, and it sounds like the same creature my father saw He looked to be at least 5' 6"" tall down on his knuckles and could be easily taller than that  Sure enough, as he tore through the brush and trees, trying to find the path in the dark, he heard something coming behind him, and it was running faster than he was! There was a moment when Ted thought all was lost, as whatever was chasing him was so close that he could hear it breathing There in the yellow clay was a very large human looking footprint between 14 and 16 inches long on the side of a trench I had excavated about 3 feet deep About 8 ft tall grayish/ brownish like tree bark Keep in mind that the area is very heavily wooded, swampy and marshy in areas and highly inhospitable, once you step foot into the woods It wasn't very thick hair, seemed as if you could almost see skin through hair  It was approximately 6 feet from me  The calf weighed approx 300lbs and this animal had it in its arms running upright I asked my mom what it looked like after I finally calmed her down she said it was about 7 1/2 to 8 feet tall standing there kind of slumped over with his arms dangling, staring at her It was about the size of a man with raggy fur and entangled with twigs and leaves, it also had bright yellow eyes  Immediately upon passing the subject, I was still watching in my rear view mirrors with the subject illuminated by the headlights from a truck perhaps 1/4 mile behind me, as it ran across the road in a southerly direction, leaning forward, arms pumping almost parallel to the ground, knees bent at all times At this point I knew he saw something but I wasn't REALLY ready to call it Bigfoot Had it been windy I could have written the sounds off to cracking limbs, but there was not the slightest breeze, and the two sounds appeared to me to be a clear call and response, perhaps: “Humans over here"" … ""Roger that.” After the sounds, I froze and listened hard for several minutes for any other noise such as footfalls, stick breaks or other evidence of visitors but heard none Bigfoot is living in the Angelina National Forest, no doubts This ""thing"" was not as hefty as the pictures on your site, but he was tall with long arms B was in such a panic he could not keep the clutch pushed in on his truck because his leg was shaking so bad his foot would slip off It's about 350m NW of my location and I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me when I thought I saw a large thin shadow go past the bus The creature was dark colored, walked upright on its rear legs naturally and averaged 4-5 feet between steps (I have no way to prove that as the rain washed away any tracks) It (the ""hair"") was later analyzed by a competent scientist and determined to be of plant origin  It was very big, hairy, and running on two feet  As darkness fell, I heard a mumbling sound, like someone was whispering  A few hundred yards in, I found a somewhat human shaped footprint along the side of the firetrail She said the thing looked at her when she peered out the window,she said its eyes were human in shape but colored like an animals, his body was covered in brown long hair, it stood at least 6.5 feet tall and appeared to be angry It crossed the highway in three strides and went in to the bush as I passed by Unlike the drawings of bigfoot, he had a short neck and round head After a little while I got out to see if I could see any foot prints something ape/man like creature vault/leap over a fence, land on 2 legs and step off the trail into the forest I SAW IT!!!!! I touched it!!!! I placed my own foot in it I had no idea anyone else in my area had ever seen or reported any stories of a big foot  In that instant, I realized how incredibly wide the shoulders were, and how much the body tapered down to the feet, and observed two very long arms It had orange-brown hair all over its body except around its eyes and mouth area The feeders we were using were made of 4"" heavy PVC drain pipe about 2 feet long  She claims that she was looking into the binoculars and saw a ""large monkey looking creature.""  The funny thing was that she told me also that ""it couldn't have been a Bigfoot, cause' it was only about your size...""  (I'm approx 6 foot4, and 240 lbs The distance from the hallway to kitchen window is about 20 feet What we saw was not a bear, trotting on two legs When we asked what she saw she described something tall and hairy that was watching her Both trees were within fifty feet of the first bedding area found after my sighting This is a new hunting spot and unfortunately a bigfoot hunting party stumbles onto my husband Then all of a sudden he was at the road, and the other boys were in the car waiting to pick him up, and they drove off, totally terrified The thing that I still remember so clearly is its eyes It did not show to have recent usage (winter nest?) About eight feet away,another ceder tree showed to have branches broken down touching the ground one hundred yards down to a creek below our property, stopped and sat on a natural log bridge, suspended over this small ten foot creek, which drains down to the lake, usually having a steady but small amount of water We were within 30 feet of the bank and we both knew exactly where the sound originated You could also see its skin because the hair was thin  The fur or hair was long I am shaking now just remembering about it's eyes However, non-big foot believers say the sound came from a wounded moose, not big foot, and they gave a long speel and some outrageous example She said the eyes were just below the bottom sash bar of the window She told me that she didn’t feel threatened by whatever is was looking at her, just startled to see red eyes and something right outside the window  I'm not much of a person to get scared but this thing made the hair on the back of my neck stand up Some measurements on the window and back of house: I have measured the window in the kitchen and it is 32 inches wide and the top of the window is over eight feet off the ground outside, as the house is higher then the surrounding ground in the backyard At the time, I was a member of the Texas Bigfoot Research Center It was dark brown almost black with grass and debris in its hair like it had been laying down Within a few seconds I heard very heavy footsteps on the road  It had dark colored hair, a rather large head and I could not see the nose or eyes due to shadows I was thinking about taking a shot at him when suddenly from the 12 O'clock position, we noticed another Bigfoot that was shorter than he was and wasn't as thick, up top, and appeared to be female because of (her) actions It was not an ugly animal, it looked groomed with lots of grayish hair As we were waiting in the barn I looked back at the lake and during several flashes of lighting I saw something approx 7-8 feet tall, walking fast on it's rear legs, with it's arms swinging in a natural humanoid motion The following day we showed up early while there was still daylight and looked at the area, we were quite familiar with the immediate area and could not find anything nearby that she could have missidentified, nor did we see anything that may have been placed there the night of, the tree itself was about six feet up untill the arms split, and what she saw was a good shoulder profile I moved quckly back onto the trail and it seemed I wasn't being followed so I slowed my pace, by this time I was about 100-125 yards from the point I had urinated I turned and saw this dark figure walk upright out of the east woods and stop at my puddle area it squatted for a few second then stood up and looked directly at me for a few more seconds The skin color was a dark gray almost blackish in color This thing was approximately 8' tall and covered in long hair I had crossed over 2 creeks and saw a very large, dark figure just off the highway to my right  I saw the right side of the creature, and I estimate somewhere between 7 & 8 feet tall It was quiet, when I saw something, large and dark brownish, stand up and walk away from me  I always drive below speed limit because of deer as I was driving over a bridge  on 279 entering Vanzandt county had my bright lights on to the right saw this big hairy thing carrying a deer it kind of scared me never saw nothing like that I just took off. it was very dark In March 2001 at 4:30 am on my way home from work, on the back roads, something crossed in front of my headlights, this ""thing"" had long hair, long arms, between 6-7 feet tall and traveling fast Then my horse jumped to the right, I looked over to the left expecting to see a rattlesnake and squatting in a large brush (a group of bushes - not just one bush) was something large - it was very dark and scared me to death! My horse took off running It was in the morning, around 9:00, when a huge brownish-red haired creature crossed 70+ yards in front of them After looking further we found a barefoot print measuring appro 14"" He watched a huge dark hairy creature walking upright on two legs, not just walk in the direction of where his dad went, but walk the exact trail he took It was about 45 minutes till dark and my feeder just went off there were some doe out to the right of the feeder about 100yards  He was covered with hair As I was walking back to the truck I saw a foot print in some loose soil. I could not see anything because it was so dark I had my high beams on because it was beginning to get dark outside This was (2017) and we no longer waited until after dark to leave our hunting spots It was dark and under the cover of trees where we were parked you could not see your hand in front of your face I had never mentioned anything to her about bigfoot (smell sounds).It is my belief that this is what she had contact with He had hair all over him his feet were large, that's about the best description I can give The height of the figure could have been anywhere between five feet and eight feet, and certainly bigger than a child  It began to make a squelling bark kinda noise and in 2 or 3 strides was past me and headed for the road [It was] between 6 & 7 feet tall and brownish in color. From the top of the slope to the water is probably about 30-40 feet with an incline of about 15 degrees What I saw was at least 5 to 6 feet above the edge of the road, and the ground were it was standing is 2 to 3 feet lower than the road She did not see the outline of a body, just the eyes Classic Bigfoot howl that sounded a good ways off This time it was further away, then it screamed again yet only a few feet from us What they saw was described as about seven-foot tall, covered with hair, but could not make out the face We started to look for footprints, the ground was dry and covered with leaves but we did find large scrapes going up the hill to where the car was parked, they looked like it was where the animal jumped over the hill It started to get darker so I started home. The oddest thing (as if the creature weren't enough) was that its eyes glowed faintly pale yellow in its dark face The hair was long and matted  I spotted a ""hair"" on a sapling bent over the game trail that I was following  We were placed onto our milk carton ""chairs"" behind dead vegetation about 2 feet high and 40 yards from the light placed over a pile of corn placed by the rancher She saw and then heard a very large, dark bipedal “thing” running through the pasture behind us  The footsteps got right up to the fence line It was about an hour before dark and we were driving down CR 230 I believe Thinking back the creature must have been about 7 ½ to 8 foot tall to step over the fence like that and probably would have weighed about 400 pounds I could see a large dark mass at the well The thing was probably 7 to 7 1/2 feet tall and weighed around 400-450 pounds The print wasn’t huge but it was bigger than my foot which is 13 1/2 - 4E (4E-widest size foot) It was about 6ft7in to 7ft tall, very broad shouldered, very hairy except the face Its movement from tree to tree was a quick leap, landing at the base of next tree on two feet I honestly do not know what I would have done if it had sprang to its feet (I get scared really easy) We got to a clearing and turned to face whatever it was and saw a HUGE, silver-grayish colored Bigfoot just at the tree line The next day there were large five toed footprints at the well and all the guts were gone except the heads It definitely sounded like it was walking on 2 legs So I raised my light [and] when I did the large mass stood erect on two feet  He said the color was charcoal gray and it was about 6 feet tall My feet found the drop off of the gravel bed and I jumped in the boat, grabbed the only paddle I saw, and began paddling So at this time I was somewhat seasoned to the wilderness and animals of the area and not totally green Not 70 feet from me One evening, he sits in a lean-to stand that is maybe 1/8 of a mile from bigfoot's backyard It was between 7-8 feet tall, and solid-black When my eyes focused again, I noticed the tree had hair  His friend who was on the back said that he also heard the footsteps and could see the trees ""moving"" I did see its arms as it pulled up on the rocks rolling them around but I was so startled and scared I turned and ran To my wife s dismay, the deer she shot struggled to its feet and attempted to follow  As I approached and got within about 50 meters, I saw a huge black, hairy, bipedal creature enter the cat-tails Then there was a clearing in the trees and saw a dark figure walking around in the creek lit by the moonlight  She yelled that it was a 'bigfoot' Almost like course hog hair but was soft It head turned abruptly toward the west woods and much larger dark being came slightly into view they both watched me as I back peddled watching them for another dozen or so yards when I decide home was the best place to be and ran off. The fence height is five feet along that fence line  It was a hairy creature about six and one half feet tall  The creature had a large prominant eyebrow ridge that was covered with smaller length of hair tall with high dead grass underneath It had a big stride also This animal had lots of hair and looked somewhat like an ape but was walking tall and upright, he had his back turned to us, we were simply looking out my bedroom window at the creature, but he was huge, around 7 foot tall I would say and I had 20-20 vision at that time It was about 6ft tall but it was hard to tell [for sure] at that distance All three of us watched a very tall creature completely covered with hair from head to toe stand at the side of the road and disappear into the woods Flashlights and guns pointed out at the dark we listened to the dead quiet of the woods Standing next to two trees on the top of the creek bank was a very tall dark figure It seemed to be covered totally in hair This year my husband went out there first and hunted bigfoot's backyard and told me it felt comfortable in there Mike slowed and asked ""what is what?"" and I answered ""that thing in the road just beyond the headlights."" Mike looked and said ""holy s---!"" and I said ""whatever it is don't hit it."" What we saw was a large dark upright moving creature walk in the middle of the road It was lighter around the eyes and darker over the nose and I think I caught him with sand plums in his mouth because of the red tint in the lip area When we got back to our place, we told our grandmother what we has seen and she said it was probably a bigfoot By this time darkness was beginning to fall and the woods were very dark  She says that she observed it through binoculars on two feet, and in stride, freeze, and come to a standstill stance that was the forward leg was bent at knee, and back leg trailing- arms (at least one) out along same plane, like literally freezing in stride while sort of stooping   One was about legendary creatures such as the Abominable Snowman, but a chapter also covered Sasquatch and Big Foot, which were totally new concepts to me We are both interested in the Bigfoot theory (which we believe) and had heard of tree knocking By this time, it was darker outside but in the more open areas you could see without a flashlight When I shined the light again in the direction I noticed a dark figure, big and bulky [it was] hard to tell because the flashlite wasn't very bright The highway right-of-way was cleared about 20 feet to wooded areas on both sides  Only my family and close friends have heard this, and everytime I tell it, my eyes water, and the hairs on my head stand on end (I can't explain this reaction) The hair was dark gray-ish black, and reminded me of old hay rolls that had been left out in the pasture, uncovered  It was a bigfoot, sasquatch, wooleybooger, or whatever you want to all it At first we thought it could be a man that was kicking the water, chasing a possible fish or something, but looking at the object a little closer, we knew that it was not a man because it was dark, tall, and hairy When he was a young man of 18, while on a coon hunt, he and three others encountered what I now believe was a bigfoot type of creature Before I tell you more I want you to understand I grew up and have allways lived out in the country.I have played in the woods from daylight till dark and I have never been scared like I was on this day.As I came up on a big blowdown with a lot of undergrowth around it I could see something moving around in the brush pile,I heard the limbs moving and twigs poping first and thought it might be C.E After I seen the eyes, it moved out of view, then started to throw rocks at the tank I wore binoculars and glassed our area before dark to become familiar with the terrain and where the pigs might trail to the corn  It stood well over a foot taller then me and was still 'below' me on the slope of the embankment I am 5'8"" so I would think it was about 7 feet tall  As it moved over the bank, paused, and moved down to the river out of sight, I noticed the hair on its rear end was thinner and I could see its butt The hair was still standing up all on my arms! I decided to make this report after my oldest daughter came home last January, very upset and talking about a ""monkey-man"" that had run in front of her car What was seen: A lean (my guess male) hairy (yellow in the headlights; poss.grey/silver) creature/being/bigfoot calmly stride to the center of the road, pause, turn slightly to look in our direction for a couple of seconds and the casually stide/walk off  After rolling over I pulled the hide back and there was a sharp edged stone underneath the hide with flesh and blood on the stone--I kept this stone--there was also a 10 feet dragging kill-blood streak across the rocks, then it abruptly stops, and the deer's carcass seems to be thrown about 15 feet from that spot with no blood stains in between the two spots One looked to be about 7-8 ft tall and the other 6-7ft tall.I started to get scared even though they were on the other side of a barbed wire fence and about 35yards from the horse and me Between fireworks I started to hear behind me in the dense woods a crackling noise and a sound I can only describe as a grunted or wooshing grunt sound very loudly, I sorta ignored it a first and then I began to pay more attention, my son concentrating on the next firework to light he was not registering the noise, suddenly the noise got much louder and my son stated, ""What was that Dad?"" I grabbed the flashlight and shined into the dark woods, it was so thick and dark, I could not see anything, the noise kinda stopped for a bit and I told my son, I think some farmer has some cows or something in those woods I thought it was a bear, but chances of seeing a bear in 1979, would be slim.This animal walked on two legs It had hair all over it, it was like nothing I have ever seen I had barely turned when I saw a huge dark shape about ten to twelve feet away through some very thick yaupon brush The banks of this creek were anywhere from 5 to 25 foot tall, and we often walked it when we went hunting The hair on it was dark brown, close to a chestnut horse By a tree I saw a patch of dark brownish fur  You could tell that it had the body of a large man except this reddish brown hair covered it's body  Which is odd because the individual would have to be very tall, much taller than what would be considered a normal sized person, for me to see from where I had been standing I dubbed this general area bigfoot's backyard, jokingly  It was as if something had grabbed the branches about 5 to 6 feet up and was shaking them which in turn was making both of the trees shake from top to trunk Were talking a four foot side step The fence is at least four to five feet tall The body was covered with thick, matted hair  Then I remembered when I was watching the history channel about bigfoot and the people recorded a call from bigfoot and they played it and it sounded just like what I just heard. As we looked around we noticed the tall grass was pushed down like a deer had bedded down there It was walking on two legs I am 6' 4"" with a 38"" inseam, this was a large stride It seemed to walk like a person, it was too far away to notice any details about face, hands or feet She claims she saw a tall hairy figure with a pointed head watching her from behind a tree with Y shaped arms surrounded by small brush in the middle of a small clearing about 25ft No hairy creature like you here The guys we were with went in and rented two boats for a couple of hours while we waited outside.While on the lake I felt like someone was watching me, I quickly turned around to look into the eyes of a large black hairy creature approximately 8 or 9 feet tall that was standing at the edge of the lake right next to the waters edge looking right back at me Then after I heard it rustling in the woods, everything was quiet, except for a dog howling and going crazy! The sound literally gave me cold chills and made the hair stand up on my neck Its arms were longer than a man's, swinging them as it walked  It had long arms I think and large hands It was about 7 or 8 feet tall because it was taller than the sign there at the bridge, at least head and shoulders taller This thing was humane in appearence but was dark in color that looked like fur or long hair I'm 6 foot, 4 inches and about 250 lbs and in very good health and considered somewhat a large and strongly built man in the upper body Its face had no hair Coal black eyes, wide nose, very long arms and big hands The sun shone through the trees and I could see the legs had reddish brown fur but was shaggier than a deer Recently my son went outside just after dark Nor did we find any hair I believe there were five of us there...we saw a huge animal of some sort, covered in red fur, flaying it's arms and making a dreadful howling noise toward the dogs  Enough to make my eyes water We saw less than 100 feet away from us a creature cross the road from left side of road to right It was about 7 feet tall, walking upright, and covered with long shaggy hair I was thinking maybe it was a bigfoot we saw on that morning back in 1994 in august I am not saying I saw a Bigfoot I remembered that as it had gotten dark, dogs could be heard across the nearby road, barking like crazy  I turned around in the saddle and looked back and to the left of where we were about 10 feet away to see two pine trees shaking bad I noticed an old plastic pail hanging about five or six feet up on the tree that had been shook The smaller one(12 O'clock position) was at over 7 feet tall and was standing there rocking back and forth, but not as violently as the larger one It was on the fence line 175 - 200 yards away, where I saw a large dark figure (standing on two legs), and appeared to be trying to get a better look at me, by leaning one way then the other The weight I listed earlier is due to the fact that a creature that tall and broad and the depth it had to have since it seemed so powerful; must be at least the weight I listed as 450 to 500 pounds It was a darkish gray-brown color with hair all over its body, deep set eyes, about 7-8 feet tall, slender with long arms, and it moved very quickly The sound of the running was very heavy footfalls of what sounded like large animals At the time I didn't think about it being a big foot because I have never heard of any in the area This was private property a mile off the nearest road and I didn’t see a gun! It was also deer season, dark outside, and the woods are thick with trees, vines, and briars The subject was perhaps seven feet tall, all dark brown in color, perhaps 3 inch long hair overall, very wide shoulders, and long arms, the fingertips about parallel with the tops of the knees If someone was there they were well hidden and light on their feet because I didn't even hear footsteps Upright, it appeared to be around 5-foot tall with a fairly large stride They said that the eyes were approximately 7 to 8 feet high, wide apart and red It wasn't dark yet These trails are always very dimly lit because of the canopy created by the tall pine trees I saw something very tall and dark cross the road ahead of my car  The witness believes that the animal suddenly hid in the tall grass surrounding it in order to escape his scrutiny I could not believe what I was seeing, this thing was around 6 to 7 feet tall with dark brown hair covering its whole body It had noticeable hair and its head seemed domed and no neck, as if its head rested right on its shoulders I looked back at my son and he was still trying to get the firecracker lit, I grabbed him, calmly told him to get into the dingy and we paddled away fast, despite my sons complaints, we left the folding chair, the remaining fireworks and a small cooler, I left and did not look back until I was well away from the bank I don’t know if it was a big foot or not, and I’m not saying it was THERE WAS ONE SINGLE SOLITARY FOOTPRINT I know their arms are longer than humans, but this still makes him a very tall boy! I have had to estimate the weight of cattle most of my life and was always been within 10 -25 lbs of guessing them correctly Bigfoot is a real animal not a mythical creature Traveling west on Highway 60 out of Brazos County TX into Burleson County TX , 200-300 yards after crossing the Brazos river I seen a large dark object on the side of the road It began to move as I got closer it was covered in what looked like mud covered hair I saw a black fiqure on the side of the road that looked likea a large animal rolling on the ground like it was trying to scratch its self, it was night time (11:30 PM) but you could see well in the dark with the high beams and running lites on my rig He shined his flashlight to an old vehicle he has in the pasture and saw eyes I firmly believe she saw and heard a Bigfoot that evening  And I consider myself to be one who quickly debunks extraordinary claims by others concerning UFO activity, Lock Ness Monster shenanigans, and - yes - even BIG FOOT sightings It was about 5 ft tall and was covered with gray hair"
Utah,"Something was outside! This has been 20 years ago and as I’m writing this I have goose bumps on my arms, I have never been so scared in my life  If it were a person they would have had to have been yelling at the top of their lungs (louder than I can imagine any human yelling) every 20 or 30 seconds for almost 2 hours while trekking close to a mile across a rugged mountainside in the pitch dark When the lightning would go off we could see the shadow of long hair hanging down from massive arms  I got chills up my spine when I heard these bigfoot audio screams When it reached the steep (empty) canal bank it used it's arms like legs, knuckles down, like a quadruped, to swifty climb the embankment  From time to time, I would emerge from the tent flaps spotlighting for glowing eyes I turned the key and a big fast black hairy object made me turn my head to the left, and i saw it run very fast into the thick oak trees The next morning; a group of horseback riders we met on the trail told us that something had spooked their horses during the night and they had mentioned something about a Bigfoot I never believed in Bigfoot  Pine boughs were laid by reaching up and pulling them off and laying them on the ground 12 -15 feet off the ground, about a 10 ft across circle so it was no small animal  It disappeared into the dark on the other side of the Hwy  I remember very vividly the hair bouncing as it took long strides I am 6 feet tall and the dent was so high on my camper that if I stood next to the camper and tries to touch the dent I almost had to jump to reach it Our bodies were vibrating from the screams, our noses and eyes were running from the smell  By this time it was really dark it was hard to see your hand in front of you I was looking around to see what else might happen when on the edge of one of the surrounding fields stood a line of fairly tall trees I hightailed it out of there and returned at dark with hunting equipment to track it, but only found where it went through the oak, the leaves were deep and the bank was torn up  Right out the back door we have a small area of cement to play basketball and right off the side of that there is a ravine that slopes down off the back side for a 100 feet or so and its thick with acorn trees and other trees  My father and I are both avid bigfoot enthusiasts and have been to all of the locations of recent sightings in Utah posted on your site  He was  8 to 10 feet tall, had a hairy body and looked like the ones I have seen on TV  He was swinging his arms like a human and he kept glancing back to see how fast we were apporaching The thing was about 30 feet away from us in the pines  So the two of us are stopped and staring into the darkness, laterally you could see nothing but black, and we hear a low guttural growl, it wasn't feline, it wasn't bear it wasn't human My friends found a spot about 100 feet from my camper and set up there She said she had watched it the whole time after i let her in the jeep and got in myself till i started the jeep, and she said it was a bigfoot the foot print were bare foot!!!!!!!!! I could see toe prints clearly!!!! at fist I could not believe it and I looked again and again and measured them and looked at more thinking I was going crazy ...... At first I thought maybe it was a moose looking either at us or away from us because it was tall and skinnier than if you saw a moose standing sideways It was large, Tall, and hairy it stood about 7 ft tall The area where we had pitched the tent was in tall grass  I remember we made a rip-roaring fire and talked about Bigfoot and had a night-visit from a chipmunk that scared us our eyes locked on one another The last night we were there around 1:30 am in the morning my wife and I were woke up by something hitting the side of my camper; my truck was a 1986 full size truck and an 11 foot camper I had just entered Grove Creek Canyon when I saw a large red animal up on the rim of the canyon, about 100 feet above me  Well we stopped and picked up a good size rock on the side of the road and decided if it came out of the darkness toward us we would throw a rock in its direction and take off  They had forgotten worms so both went out into the willows and were digging worms...all the while feeling something was watching them.....Mike said the hair on the back of his neck was standing on end when ever he would look around to see if they could see anyone watching them I quickly realized that I was looking at a Bigfoot  My brother in law teased me about my ""big Foot"" experience  Just south of our camp was the outflow stream of Hoop Lake that cut a very deep gorge, some 100+ feet deep  It was stuck to the bark of the pine trees, it was all over the pine boughs and appeared that there was back scratching where I thought only something bigger and taller than a bear could reach We knew it had to be nine feet tall at least to hover over the tent  It ran across the road approx 70 feet in front of my car  We used to leave fishing hooks on a line in a creek down the road, we got so absorbed in playing in the creek we didn't realize it was getting dark, the bats were coming out well i was driving down the road late at night headed back to work in vernal utah i was driving over the flaming gorge pass i was somewhere between 1 to 3 miles before the dam turn off when i was driving i seen some eye balls about 6 1/2 to 7 feet in the air so i locked up my breaks backed up to and faced my head lights at it and i seen it my first thought was a bear that was standing on its hind legs but then i noticed it was not a bear by that time he turned around and slowly started walking away from me it had verylong black mated hair and i know for a fact it wasn't a bear by the way it walked it scared me so bad i got out of there and i did not care to go back and look so the next few times going back through been watching every track to see if i could  find them but  no luck but i know one thing he was not scared of me nore my loud deseil motor i looked through my binoculars and could see a large black shape moving through heavy cover and at first thought it was a black bear but as i watched it didn't have the bouncing motion that bears have when they run because their front legs are shorter than the rear legs Every hunter's hopes are that he is going to see something before it gets dark But a friend of mine, who is a ""bigfoot enthusiast"" directed me to this site We decided to stretch our legs and walk down to it  It was about 3:00 pm and I was concerned that we would be caught on the mountain at dark  We chose a secluded high mountain meadow (park) with thick dark pines on one side and mixed aspens and pines on the other But the grass was so tall we found nothing I never thought of this as being a ""bigfoot"" sighting as I hadn't heard anyone ever describe a white bigfoot I turned to look at what he saw and could not believe my eyes  My father has a few different friends that have seen a  bigfoot or had experiences, but my Dad thinks its all a joke  We sat and ate our steaks as the yell continued to echo into the dark silent night I had heard of bigfoot or yeti and I knew about those but thats in Tibet and Nepal and I had no idea there was anything other than an occasional bear or a few cougars What caught my attention the most was the long strides when they walked When he told me the story, I told him that there was a bigfoot in his vicinity, that's where the smell was coming from I have always believed it was a bigfoot It had long arms and was massive in size in comparison to a man  We all turned and looked and we saw something dark working its way through the timber We had never heard of Bigfoot and he wanted to protect us  There was muddy footprints upstairs and downstairs At the time of the incident there was no talk about bigfoot...It was not in the media and not on television  His hair was blowing in the wind, and we did not feel any fear  Since then I have talked to 3 friends that have eyewitness accounts -one of them gave me a cutout of a footprint that they found near their ranch in Idaho They looked very dark brown or even black and my impression was they were not human  After several hours of hiking in heavy timber, we finally topped the mountain at 9,995 feet and reached Round Lake I followed the foot prints to where they were going because they were going to the valley overlook..  I could hear them walking around and I listened extra hard to recognize how large they must have been from the extra heavy footsteps and very long strides I looked at my wife, she sat frozen and i  knew what i saw ( i thought it was a bigfoot) so i asked my wife if it was a bear she said no so i asked if it was a moose she said no so i asked if it was a black cow and she said it was a hairy bigfoot  The hair stood up on the back of our necks, and we decided that we had heard enough  It was probably 10:30 or 11:00 at night by now and pitch dark  My brother was looking into the trees and I glanced over towards where the scouts were, when I saw something with long white/blond hair was staring into their camp My parents still live there, and there was nobody in their neighborhood or that area at that time who was that tall. what we observed was something walking like a human covered with dark brown hair It looked about 6 feet tall hunched over, but it covered alot of ground fast  I remember we had to talk louder than normal to hear one another over the loud, cruch of our feet walking on the crunchy snow All the pines sit on the north side of the mountain, but everywhere else is very dense brush and very tall So I sat up and what I saw freaked me out! In the light of the full moon I could see a VERY tall dark figure standing about 25 yards from us Again, not having any idea that these so called bigfoot or sasquatch or abominable snowman were real we went over to my grandmother's house and I don't know how the discussion got to that point but I asked her if she had ever seen or heard of anything like a yeti or a bigfoot When we lost him we turned around and I saw two figures maybe 300 yards away, a taller one a shorter one, walking in the opposite direction from us Dark eyes, and fairly tall It was a rocky ledge that ended in maybe a 20 foot drop He was about seven or eight feet tall with a stride that I cannot forget For years we joked about big foot till I saw that movie It was getting dark, so we heeded out of it as the foot prints went under the shadow of the evergreen tree I saw what shocked me...   From the way it was running I could tell it was on two legs, although I couldn't see below the shoulders due to the vegetation in the area It was to dark now to see any of my other hunting companions  It was huge & hairy with long arms  None of the scouts had blond or white hair  As I looked into the water, I pointed and said ""Footprints""!!  My brother in law laughed at me, but what I saw were large dips as if something had walked into and out of the water When we awoke in the morning I was very cautious and opened the door, the sun was just barely cracking to the east and the sky was a dark blue it was moving on two legs and moving fast At first I thought it may be horses running but realized that there were only two feet making the sound and not four there were three of them as far as I could tell They stopped about 30yds below me  just in the trees and buckbrush they wouldnt come any closer, The hair on my  neck started to stand up,so I wasnt going down to  see what they were, so we cackeld back and forth about a half hour and I couldnt get them to come out and they wouldnt budge either, I was the One with 7mm in my hand  but I was alone and being 3miles from my truck I had no idea what they were at the time.and I wasnt going to find out, I decided to run for for it  It was bothering me badly to the point that we went over to the scout’s camp and asked if anyone in their party had blond or white hair It made our eyes water and our noses run, it was that bad  Somewhat disappointed with fishing, we gathered up our gear and found a good campsite several hundred feet away from the lake Tent was tall enough to give the adults a couple feet of head room  I had a reaction - the hair stood up on the back of my neck and on my arms  When I saw it do that I tried to listen to its footsteps but heard absolutely nothing walking down into the trees  I don’t know what it was that my brother and I saw that winter evening but I know that Im 6’3” and that fence I'm talking about is as tall and even a little taller than I am I sat there trying to adjust my eyes to see where to make the next step as I was walking it was much easier to step into the tracks of the person (the snow was about 1 foot deep)..  I don’t know if there is such thing as UFOs, aliens or bigfoot but what I do know is that whatever scared us off of that mountain that night is something beyond what I know of  Then I came across a Bigfoot audio His face was white and his eyes were huge with fear There about fifty feet or so away was a large upright creature casually strolling in a parallel line with us He was dark in color and didn't seem to be coming after us Also it moved a pine bow that flipped from the ground to about five feet in the air  It was walking upright on two legs like a man i am convinced what we saw is a bigfoot  It was dark, probably around 7 or 8 o'clock A Bear does not move that fast on it's hind legs As I was leaving the mountain I saw more foot prints on the south side of the mountain going down into Rock Canyon. I got scared and the hair on my neck stood up!!!!!!!!!!! It was very very spooky!!!! and I was alone and going to spend the night with this animal.... But being that it was dark, I couldn't really see the trail  I just remember thinking… wow that’s a tall person wearing a beanie Years later he told my granddaughter that he confronted Bigfoot that night and could never get over it When I was a child before bigfoot was known to me, we went on a family camping trip in Butterfield Canyon in the Oquirrh mountains below Kennecott Copper Mine  We returned to our camp well after dark after searching for my arrow that I shot at an elk that evening as I did this I was shocked at the size of the man I was trying to step into the foot steps of....  I couldn't help but notice an immense amount of reddish, brownish hair everywhere  As we made it to the clearing my daughter and I stopped cold and she said big foot!  What we saw was a footprint about 15 inches long and 6 to 8 inches wide  It was getting dark we headed to a meadow to meet my cousin and uncle I turned around and about thirty feet from me, standing beside a large tree and bush was a very large creature Its arm were long and swinging back and forth and it was taking long strides with each step it took It looked about as tall as a large man It had reddish-brown long hair over its body It appeared to be looking east, up the canyon and into the small valley between the foothills, where we were, and Mt.Timpanogos It was black with hair all over its body, except for its face which seemed to be sort of a lighter color  His hair was brown in color Since we were Archery hunting you can't have any firearms so all I had was a knife"
Vermont,"He was hoping it was a bigfoot and not a lion The next night, Saturday, I was sitting around the campfire around 11:00 pm talking and we heard footsteps coming from the woods which we were right next to, but the noises were coming from inside the woods In the middle of Friday night, I would guess around 1-2 a.m., I woke up and was walking to the building beside the main house to use the rest room, and as I left my tent and was walking toward the restroom I heard footsteps walking near me in the woods Both times that I heard the noise it sounded like a large animal and from what I could hear it sounded like a large animal walking on two feet That night it got dark, and he was also ""helped"" off the mountain, though ""it"" always stayed the same distance behind him. The interesting part was that the park ranger acknowledged the report with a ""Yeah, we get lots of reports of bigfoots, but we try to keep it on the down low."" When I asked him about mountain lion sightings, he seemed scared and said, ""You think there are mountain lions up there?"" It was odd that bigfoot was ""normal"" and mountain lions were ""strange""! When I came back, I heard from someone else that this same ranger had been followed down the hill by something he nicknamed Roy It walked across the road in two strides, was heavily built, covered in short dark hair and, as stated previously, approximately eight  feet tall Very quickly she said, ""I don't know what it was but it was real big, maybe eight feet tall, hairy and crossed the road in two steps."" She saw the same thing I did There were tall reeds there and it disappeared into them  It crossed the road about 50 feet ahead of us and judging from the trees where it crossed the road I'd say her height estimate is accurate +/- 20% They touched and the toes went out and away from each other like a duck's feet It was about 3 to 4 feet tall, long dark brown to black hair, running on 2 legs As we drove along Tyson Road I saw a large bipedal form cross the road in two strides"
Virginia," I remember feeling scared but also brave going out in the dark to deal with this bear or whatever it was  (All the reports of bigfoot sightings I have ever read however seem to say that they are brown or black in color) That was about 6 feet in one step These sounded like the footsteps of a man (as in 2 legged) hello my name is xxxxxx born xxxxxx i live in darlington sc in a community near the great pee dee river called mechanicsville i dont remember the exact year but between 1984-1986 me and my father were on a boat cruising very slow in the middle of the river the river was about 80-100 feet wide now let me say what i saw i dont believe to be bigfoot but i am sure it is an unknown animal it was littler than i have heard bigfoot being but it was the size of a big man i we were going up river and i looked to the left and i saw him  now this all happened in about 3 seconds he was crouched down still on his feet with knees bent like he was doing something between his legs on the ground he saw me when i saw him i looked into his face from about 40 feet he had long reddish brown hair all over but around his face was a lot lighter he dove into the water extending his arms just like a diverand he was gone we went to where he was and all there was were smears in the clay i really wish we would have looked more my dad saw him as he was going into the water this is the truth have anyone heard anything like this Well, what I saw was no Racoon, it was a furry creature, standing about 4 ft tall, standing upright (and I don't mean on its's hind legs), that jerked it's head suddenly to it's ""left"" towards me, about 20ft away  I was sitting in a swing beside the porch and Dad was sitting in a chair on the porch  The dark object went from horizontal to vertical, turned away from me, and walked into a laurel thicket, making very little noise I totally forgot about this incident for nearly a year It made us both smile, and I looked Bigfoot up on the internet the next day, as I had heard about sightings all across the US, but had never heard of them being around populated areas in the Virginia area. About 20 feet from the car my wife and I heard a loud but short scream coming from the direction of the swamp It was dark out, not too late but it was dark and as we turned a corner my wife and I saw something in the middle of the road It was getting dark [dusk] and I could hear children playing, but just over looked it What I saw that night has haunted me for a long time until today when I got a text message from my brother about an article he read from you guys about Big Foot sightings in Nottoway and Brunswick counties After daylight I searched for tracks, spoor, hair, in the area The hair was a reddish brown and about 4 inches long The footsteps seemed to stop and continue for maybe an hour or so The shorter foot was about 9"" long with a more ""human""look to the shape The animal was standing on its hind legs and because the fire was directly behind it, it was a silhouette of a tall, 7ft She thinks it was a Bigfoot We rounded a corner & saw a figure on the road in front of us crossing the road - maybe about 200 feet away  She said, ""is that Bigfoot"" Chiswell my friend and me where coming out at dusk when it was getting dark I said, ""we need to go I don't want to be out here at night"" so we were walking down the trail so we get out of the forest, I was feeling very weird at this time because something didn't feel right to me it felt like someone was following as you already know you can tell if someone or something is looking at you, so I let my friend out of the tree line first because I always do that and when I was coming out I heard a crash in the woods it sounded like something crashed down from the tree I turn around and saw a dark figure standing in the trail we just got off of, my friend was 30 ft in front of me when he heard the thing that was in the woods he ran  But what amazed me was that it reached the middle of the road in three strides  It was a clear night, dark and around 8:55pm I came around a bend through a wooded area when my headlights caught an animal that was hairy, walked upright and stood about 8 feet or so tall The dark mass I thought was a bear then stood up and chased the deer into the woods IN MAY 1970 MY BUDDY AND I WERE RIDING IN HIS 1957 WILLIES JEEP IN THE W&O RAILROAD TRACK IN PURCELLVILLE, VA ABOUT TEN PM WHEN WE ENCOUNTERED A LARGE BIPEDAL ANIMAL CROSSING THE TRACKS APROX 70 TO 100 YARDS IN FRONT OF US But later on in the season, I think the same week, two people heard the same thing on a ridge above the car after hunting all day and returning to the car after dark Even a grizzly was not as tall as the smallest ones arm reach I live in the country and unless someone is doing this in a costume then this is the real bigfoot The arms seemed very long The sun was to my left shining across this road to the right as I looked down this narrow road there was a reflection of the light coming off the fur of something that I never had seen before,it was tall and massive There was less hair on its shoulders and lower body After seeing it chase the deer on two legs back into the forest, I knew instantly that no bear could have ran so fast and so graceful on two legs It looked like some of the pictures we have seen about bigfoot Of course, we'd never heard of Bigfoot then, but a few years later, after many ribbings from my Dad, and brother and sister, we did talk about it one night and did speculate that just maybe that is what I saw that night During his time alone, he commented that he heard loud foot steps behind him We did this every fall as a treat after a tough season of high school football The combination of the rancid odor, the long quick strides it took, the ""floppy"" ears, the size (certainly bigger than an old man), and its color (black/dark brown)  now makes me wonder if I saw a sasquatch umm, there is a Bigfoot walking across the range!” This range was only a few kilometers from our location  He said that it was very hairy, and described the hair as ""long and curly like a sheepdog"" It was very strange and made the hair on my arms stand up I could tell it had hair because it was thick and long from under it's arms  Later that evening we heard a radio report of a ""bigfoot"" sighted on a range. was right in front of my light, about 10 feet away Then about 10 min later there was a splash in the water about 20 feet away from our boat The thing was at least 8 foot tall and had to top 500lbs We thought it was a bear or a deer but it was clearly on two feet by the sounds it was making We made dinner inside and after we ate the footsteps were right next to the cabin, there was a window opposite the door with wood shutters on the blinds that were closed so I opened them expecting to see a person but we all witnessed a dark, very hairy large face looking at us about a foot outside the window All of a sudden, the two stepped back into the darkness of the woods and a third one stepped out The reason I am supplying the story now is that while recently at the YMCA working out I overheard a conversation about someone encountering what they thought was a ""bigfoot"" in that general area The large woodlot across the tracks is semi-surrounded by a loose assortment of houses in a neighborhood, which could be easily walked through unseen in the dark  We quietly listened until we could not hear anymore footsteps, and then talked about what it may have been for a little while until we decided to just go back to sleep (our dog ALWAYS growls and barks at people, but she didnt, so we figured it was just an animal, or a tree limb swinging past the window) Very dark night It was on 2 feet, had dark hair all over its body  It appeared startled as it jerked its head looking towards the oncoming car, I saw what looked like two long furry ears (possibly dread-lock type hair) swing around, following its head I noticed cinnamon colored hair on its back I was driving down Pohick Road in Fairfax one evening, this animal walked out from behind a road sign, stopped, stared at me, then with one stride it was on the other side  My first impression was that it looked like one of those old aviator hats with the long ""ear pieces"" but with hair It was walking behind the guard rail and there is no way it was a man, it was way too dark out I saw it step on the road then across a small ditch & low bank in one stride  I just caught a glimpse of something dark moving down the hill thru the trees Which was a very hairy and long armed animal  I could see hair maybe 4 or 5 inches long hanging from its left arm clearly It was about 5 feet tall (I'm 6 ft I was embarrassed and did not wish to be labeled as someone that told tall tales I investigated the next day and there are footprints that are about 18 to 20 inches in the field It was very much the same coloring, mane, head and eyes The draggin sounds were long footsteps coming from outside Its body was wide at the shoulders like a football player with shoulder pads on When we got about half way through Virginia I was just looking out the window, bored of course,  then bam! Just like that I see this large hairy black creature walking in the woods in between the trees about 20 or 30 yards away from the road I believe We began to hear slow moving, very heavy footsteps walking around the perimeter of the location we were at We were too shocked to follow it and we were too scared because it was getting dark and we didn't want to stray too far from the trail It was dark brown and had shaggy hair like fur A group of us from Roanoke Virginia were on our annual after football season camping trip in the George Washington National Forest My son and I were about 125 feet away at the most It had to be about 8 to 9 foot tall because it's head was at the chest area of the scarecrow on the wooden cross At this point I could see the eyes were very dark and large looking It appeared to be grinning and had a grey hairless face It made the hair on my neck rise, and a chill go down my back, I still feel that fear even today  He said it was very broad and very tall but he could not tell me just how tall it was Its back was covered with what appeared to be layers of dark matted hair Long stride on the larger We kind of forgot about it until watching Finding Bigfoot several years later I could see hair hanging from the arms It ran by us about 10 feet away and ran off down the side of the mountain The first thing I noticed was the glowing red eyes It was about 4 foot tall and COVERED in fur I was in terror because the thing was shaped like a man but was covered with hair ( sweating ) and I gave the whole of the basin below me...a very slow careful  micro observance with my eyes..... Just stood there and looked.I actually only saw it for a couple seconds but it was about 4 feet wide at the shoulder and dark colored While I was a Marine stationed at one of the schools demostration camps in Quantico VA I observed something that looked like a bear while walking my post, what alerted me was a dog that use to walk post with whoever was on duty at night, when she started to bark I looked up and saw a figure that was about 7 feet tall had light brownish hair on it's body, was not able to see the face due to the darkness of the wooded area, but when I told the dog to go after it, the figure just stayed there and didn't move, but when I put a round in the chamber of my M1 it took off running, I never saw it after that, I asked some Marines that came from that area if there was an animal that looked like my description and their remark was, what did you have to drink, I really never paid any attention to the matter until years later I started to see stories of big foot, I am hoping that my story can confirm someone elses sighting in that area. This thing had to be 7 and a half to 8 feet tall  She had only caught a glimpse of something dark and figure I was just watching a bear ""I am a former United States Marine who in 2008 had a very compelling sighting of what can only be discribed as a Bigfoot We told other people we were heading out to find Bigfoot in jest, we were all really going to just get away from everything for a couple of days I have walked for hours by flashlight to get to hunting stands and have never ever seen eyes this shape and of this brilliance and set this far apart before It, he, was crossing a three strand barbed wired fence in one stride Between cries, I realized I could hear leaves rustling loudly as though two feet were shuffling through them in large strides It was on 2 legs and it saw our car and ran and jumped over the fence towards the left like it was nothing  I don't know what it was out there, but after reading about the rock throwing, the grunts and growls, the expo in VA/WVa and hearing that chilling howl sound byte, my brain tells me it had all the earmarks of a Bigfoot sighting The front legs seemed taller than the rear About 8 feet tall and weighing upwards of 500 pounds I suppose The only difference was the size, what I saw was huge, on all fours maybe almost the size of a Volkswagen Beetle but if it stood up not quite so tall...but then again the sighting was only seconds before I had to return my attention to navigating the rest of the turn at maybe 40 miles per hour  The arms and upper thighs were so big that I could see the outline of muscles  Thats when I realized I was seeing a Bigfoot As I got closer it appeared the Mom (I assume that since there was a baby with it) put the baby down and was bending over for rocks?  At that time the baby looked right at me and it looked just like the Wukie (?, the furry, hairy creature) on Star Wars and it had a brown looking nose THE ANIMAL LOOKED ROUGHLY 7 TO 8 FEET TALL, COVERED IN REDISH GREY HAIR Just the second I felt that way.....i looked up as did my dog , and in a split half second ( if it can be measured like this in this situation)  I observed about  100  yards ahead standing tall to the hill-side tree's growing from the hillside itself , was something that just disappeared as quickly as viewing it : As it happened...my shepherd (who always heeds my commands) bolted like I never had ever seen her go , I immediately set the sack down with my spine tingling a bit , I called up through the primitive valley , her name....again , again , again & again....and much more , she was a long ways of very quickly , ( she was also very , very fast ) Finally after about 3 or 4 minutes, she came back to me...nearly crawling, now ...in order for this to have happened to her... I do not believe in Bigfoot but I cannot explain this? I stopped and watched it walk away into the light and it was huge and there was an odor that really stunk in the air 34 years!!! One night, about 10pm, or there about, I had a civilian motorist come to the gate off highway 1 and ask me to call the State Police, I asked why and he said this big BIG hairy thing..  When it stood up on two legs, turned around and looked at us we all started screaming because it was not at bear at all I would keep thinking it had gone off in another direction, then  would see a dark patch in the break in the trees It wasn`t really that tall, maybe between 6 and 7 feet When I saw this creature I finally blurted out Bigfoot! My dad had his eyes on the road and thought we were joking or something The week of 10/9/2011 my husband, myself, sister-in-law, her husband, plus 4 daughters of theirs, plus another couple saw this dark image that I took a picture of By the way, the kitchen window is about 8 feet off the ground due to the slope of the mountain. This one was unbelievably tall hairy ape like figure I was brisk fully walking backwards and pulled my knife out I was in fear for my life from what I saw whatever it was stood I say around 7 to 8 ft tall I only saw the silhouette of it it was very tall and very broad across the shoulders, I saw it for about 3 to 4 seconds and ran to my left with incredible speed and I ran to the truck in fear for my life Its arms were spread out to either side We saw the dark image move, like it was sqatting down then stood up and appeared to be walking around a tree  Though we were 40 feet apart we did not see a face, but the smell was like road kill  About 20 feet in front of me I saw a massive (at least 8 foot tall and very broad in the chest) creature walking across the road  It had medium size brown eyes and said no way in the world it was a bear I made of her & gratified her for returning to me , and after a few minutes we started toward the very hillside where it had been (whatever it was ) and as I approached the spot I felt was just about where this may have been , it smelled so bad...like something was unclean of itself , in a hygiene sort of way as well as rotten breath or stink from a dead carcass or fur : I looked down at the ground & around a bit....but no signs of prints or anything obvious , so I started up the sheer ravine hillside on an angle , clinging to some trees and pulling myself up the hillside in a neat manner : I got to the top , rested with the sack at my feet.. The color was dark You could clearly see the eyes blink All of a sudden we heard crashing like a large animal running through the underbrush, and we saw a large figure in the general shape of a human except more hunched over and hairier than a human The arms were very long, about three inches below its knees, but in proportion with its body This thing was at least 8 feet tall Finally it walked into a larger break in the trees, and was walking on two legs I estimated its height to be over 7 1/2 feet tall because of a stop sign that it was standing next to and in 2 large bounds it cleared the road and was in the stream area As I drove around the animal, I watched it so I would not accidentally hit it as I went by (it straddled the lane markers a bit) I have followed some the prints and there is long hair brown and gray back in the woods  I painted circles around the footprints I found the next day, 3 prints, with about a 36” stride But the leaves were very, very dry and crunched under foot Its fur or hair was clumped and matted It looked very much like the bigfoot in the Patterson film almost identical I would say It had a very long stride with arms swaying back and forth and its head a little bit lowered, it really did look very similar to the bigfoot in the 67' Patterson film And that’s when I decided it was time for me to leave too.I went home and told my wife about what had just happened and she couldn’t believe it and was surprised at what I told her and ask if it was bear? I told her I never saw a beer in the woods and it seamed way to big to be a black bear.So the next day (Wednesday the 22nd) I wasn’t going to GO BACK THAT DAY.I took a camera in where I heard this animal and took pictures of what I believe to be footprints and some hair that was left on a tree limb about 5 1/2 feet off the ground  We Know it was not a bear because it ran on 2 legs He thought at first it was a man in a gorilla suit but it was way too tall to be a man  It then ran on two feet without making any sound that I could hear north along the stream faster than we could have rode our bikes  The arms moved as it walked  We decided it was either a Bigfoot or some advanced all over hair ghillie battle suit with six million dollar man powered legs. We were all pretty big guys, all football players, and pretty tough, but whatever happened that night scared us enough to break camp and move. I grew up there and I don't know of any human being who could climb that hill in the dark without stopping at all.  It was solid in color and very tall.  What I saw was huge, no way could any human be as huge, tall, and broad as this later I heard two big bangs like someone hitting a stick against a tree or log then the hair on the back of my neck stood up.Then there was the snorting of the deer that came from the thicket right after that It always stayed on two legs and looked wider and taller than a bear The thing that made us a bit UN-nerved was that that night in spite of our loud talking a deer had decided to wander up to the camp within about 10 feet and stayed next to us the entire night! This area is frequented by large amounts of hunters during the fall which should have made the deer stay very far away Everything was happening very quickly, and the only light was from our headlights, but I noticed it was tall, and skinny, a dark figure with bad posture (a little hunched over.) Taller than any man I had ever seen, and I couldn't figure out why a man would be at that particular spot, as there was not much around, and it was midnight It's arms were swinging down by it's sides About 160 yards from our deck in a small patch of woods behind our house I saw two, large, brilliant, emerald green eyes, which were the shape of human eyes, but were about 7-8 inches apart The hair was jet black head to toe, I couldnt make out any facial features I will never forget that day and as far as I am concerned bigfoot is very much a reality tall, hunched over, and hairy except for it's face  I was probably 100 to 125 yards away, but I would guess the height was around 6 and half feet by the height of the bush beside it  At first I thought it was a deer, about same coloring, but as I got closer I noticed it was not a deer at all, it was much taller, about 6 ft., from the hips down It pumped its arms as it ran and then jumped over the fence without using any effort at all  It was dark and I was using my flashlight to guide the way 3 feet off the ground Anyway, to the south in the woods I've heard bangs (what you all call knocks) and animal noises, I've seen deer running like all hell and jump the fence on to the air field in the middle of the night getting away from something and only 1 time, and it was 1 time way too many, when I saw a deer following the fence at about 2 AM one night and I heard something in the woods, I yelled out and I saw the red reflection of 2 eyes staring at me back from the blackness just inside the trees just out of range of the street light - I still see those eyes when I think about it and it's been what.. A couple of friends who worked with me decided we should do a ""Bigfoot Hunt"", aka, a weekend camping trip We could see two legs and what looked like a hand and possibly a head  It was covered in hair, walking on two legs and crossed the road in two steps and walked into the woods Or more, sack of mountain moss on my shoulder and carrying my spade in the other hand, making my way cleverly through the thick brush to return home , my very keen shepherd always at my side at command , just a few feet in front of me as I made my way , I was getting within only a couple miles from our home when this occurred : I was coming down a steep incline with thick small trees and surrounded by huge ancient trees....with a mud & rock bottom clear mountain creek running down the middle of this slight valley ravine , I had the feeling that something was observing me, as I strode forward....along with my amazingly smart dog The night was a totally moonless night, absolutely dark It wasn't until recently when my friend Randy told me about a BFRO expo in that region of VA that I even considered it being a bigfoot My boyfriend positioned the car so the lights would shine up that hill and that's when we saw 2 bright glowing red/yellow eyes looking back at us  I could not see it's feet, or the top of the head I have hunted these mountains for years and had only heard of legends of a hairy beast man and I had never seen anything like I was seeing on this morning. The smallest of the two had a arm reach about 10 to 12 feet The canal is approximately 40-50 feet across and very deep at that point and the brush on the other side was essentially a wall as it's so dense  I could see from the middle of the face and most of the legs What was strange was it was hiding behind a huge tree and how high the eyes was up from the ground was close to 7ft tall I saw out of the foggy window cause it was early winter a huge figure standing like a man with hair all over it It was a dark, rainy drive with some patchy but not heavy fog  It was eerie recounting it for Randy because each tell-tale question he asked me, I apparently answered in such a way that he was sure it was a Bigfoot sighting My husband is 5 foot 10 and what ever we saw was at least 1 and 1/2 - 2 feet taller than he was. tall & it was a good bit shorter than me) I said to my wife-""did you see that deer?"" She said-""that was no deer!!!"" It was a silvery-white, tall, vertical, slender thing with what she called ""flowing"" hair I climbed into my tree stand and reversed the batteries in my flashlight to keep it from coming on in my pack, as I usually hunt all day until after dark in the evening It was too far away to get great detail of the animal but close enough to tell that it was very large and dark brown / black in color tree stand), and carefully stood up so that my feet were not dangling off the seat  The face area looked dark, but less hairly, kind of like a thin beard in places  I was hoping to get another glimpse of it, but only managed to see patches of something dark thru breaks in the trees as it headed back up the hill on the other side Now after numerous specials and much information about Bigfoot and Devil Ape and many other names, I am more convinced than ever that I did see a small one that very night I realized it was small stones or pebbles being thrown and hitting the picnic table that was about 10 feet away Before these occurrences I was very skeptical of all the Bigfoot stories and sightings I have seen or read about, but now I am open to the possibility that there is something out there that could fit the description of a Bigfoot (Hunting season end for general firearms 10 days before this so the deer are still alert.) Then it seemed like a couple of min It was on 2 feet and walked like a human with its arms swaying back in forth right below the knees  It was covered with long hair I remember the hair covered it from head to toe, but could not make out any facial features because the light was behind it Maybe a lion? It had huge eyes like a lion as well as a mane After gathering my wits I comforted my self that I had a loaded 30/06 and nothing on earth could survive the 15 foot climb up that tree He was reddish brown with long arms.  I could hear the same steady bipedal sounding footsteps in the leaves until they went out of earshot She was sleeping when the vocalizations woke her up and made every hair on her body stand up  I also have a good friend who tells me that he saw a ""Bigfoot"" while out scouting for deer in Ironto VA It saw her, then it turned around and started to fast walk away down the hill on two feet I grew up in the area and I spent alot of time in the woods and it takes alot to frighten me! The next day I went to the same spot and found several feet of tree branches and smaller limbs at the base of several trees The airfield is not that large and I am pretty sure it's still an active military installation even now It was 20 feet from what I know was bigfoot I saw a tall dark figure move from the east side of the edge of road and go into the brush down into the stream area at Artz road She said all she could see was hair, black and dark brown all around its face it was like 30 ft away The larger of the two was several feet higher About 10-15 seconds later we heard a similar sound come from the area of the footsteps but it seemed like it was deeper in the woods I stopped the car and out of the corner of my eye I saw a large dark shape on the passenger side of the road Its eyes were sunken in and had a flat nose and a slightly protruding jaw It stood about 7ft tall and it took off up the hill I dropped my gun spun around, heading back to the front door which was locked tight! I was pounding on the door and screaming, “Let me in!” I looked to my left and where the roof meets the wall of the house I saw the outline of one shoulder and a head and two small greenish yellow eyes reflect in the porch light Stories of Bigfoot always intrigued me, and because I read quite a bit about them, my fellow officers got a kick out of asking me questions about Bigfoot habits concerning bigfoot/Sasquatch I'm 7 foot one but this thing was built, I'm tall but this must have been 6 inches to a foot taller than me  The footsteps continued to get closer and louder until whatever it was got down to the treeline, where it stopped  I could see the fear in her eyes I very quietly (barefoot) sneaked out of the tent and looked over to where the trash was and pointed the light and then hit the on button 15 feet high It went over to where I had our trash bags (10-20 feet from truck) tied up in a tree to keep animals away.The bags contained the remains of a chicken we had cooked over the fire, plus other garbage.I am 5'8"" and had the bags tied up high enough that I could not reach them This animal was upright (on 2 legs)  (this was many years ago 1970) WE saw a large hairy thing IT HAD LONG ARMS, LONG LEGS, BROAD SHOULDERS, AND NO DISERNABLE NECK Let me add that I am the worlds' biggest skeptic and have routinely dismissed all Bigfoot talk as fantasy On September 9, 2015, I was driving down 43 (W) outside of Bedford, Virginia at 11:38PM when I saw to the right side of the road, walking away from the road, a Bigfoot with child About 10-15 of us remained through dawn, knowing that running wildly in the dark would be more dangerous than fending off some drunk tall and running on two legs My wife and I looked at each other and totally agree that whatever made the howls on the program is exactly what we heard that night  When I veered off the forest road and onto a logging road, I saw a dark mass about 40 yards in front of me  The creature seemed to be a dark brown color, but it was in the shade of the trees, so I could not be 100% certain of its color  What amazed me was the length of the stride  Suddenly, I stopped the swing because I could hear footsteps coming towards us from way up on the hill  Yet whatever this was climbed straight back up that hillside in the pitch dark without stopping to rest or change directions"
Washington,"Before this sighting happened, i always believed there were bigfoot up in the woods behind our ranch We were at the river bank just after dark, when we heard a single loud splash, and then heavy steps and brush crashing as something made it's way up the bank towards us Most of the hair was an inch or two long with some maybe 4 inches on the back and shoulders left arm back...no hat no coat no clothes, there was no snout or ears like a bear...yes a conical head, tall, arms longer...legs bulky...my headlights lit it up....by the time i passed it it had disappeared into the woods and by the time i reached cook-underwood road about 600 feet...i knew what i saw but was still trying to process it...i went back on sunday to see if i could see prints but it had rained hard all nite and i saw no prints...i still see the creature in my mind... All of us goofed off for awhile running through the dark woods with flashlights, just exploring Just a solid dark color After a few minutes, we heard and felt a thud on the road about 20 feet from our truck I could hear something running away from the window, but I think that may have just been a curious couger… Everything ive read about bigfoots, since someone finally told me about them the year after I saw the thing chase the deer in the graveyard, has said that they are very shy and wouldn’t come up to a house like that Thinking he must have fallen in I yelled to see if he was alright when to my surprise we were face-to- face and he was yelling for me to run in a very  panicked voice! I wasted no time following him up the bank because it must have been something pretty serious to scare Travis as he stands 6ft tall and weighs over 220 lbs I was driving to work this morning and came around a right hand corner and less than 100 ft in front of me was a large upright dark hairy object/animal/person in the roadway walking briskly from the left to the right Its eyes were forward facing and quite round and deep set with a broad, protruding forehead I quickly woke my wife and the two of us grabbed the kids and got inside our car which was parked less that ten feet from our tent  My bedroom window looks out over the back yard from a height of about 12 feet towards the woods and we always sleep with the window open There was nothing on the road, no hair, no blood, no nothing Now the questions I have are why only 5- 6 ft tall  Anyway, we got to the spot at about 6:00am still dark, we sat in the truck till it got light enough to see better The head is notable for its pronounced brow ridge and deep set eyes, that are ""less open than human eyes"" [facing into the sun]  It walked on two legs just like a human I am writing this now because it jogged my memory from watching a bigfoot show on TV last night and it really struck a chord with me and to reach out and report what I heard That is what finally convinced my husband it had to be a big foot It was covered in dark medium length fur with patches of gray around the face and peppered throughout the body The son-in-law and grandson (who is 6' 4"" tall) went up to the area where they saw this animal, to look for it or it's tracks We were about 200 yards down from where we had been working when my partner (Joe) slipped and dropped his shovel, it slid down the steep hill about 100 feet or so  I went up the following week to look for footprints but I believe it had rained too hard, I did find some but they were too skinny and only about 13 inches long It seemed like about 15 to 20 minutes went by when i saw him coming up a different trail (off to my right, not the left where he should be) (from he mouth of boss) I got out to ask him what the heck he had been doing down there and he informed me that when he got to our trail to get out of the stream, there on the gravel bar was a freshly killed deer, steam rising from it and blood coming off it, and the brush was splattered with blood maybe as high as 8 to 10 feet It sounded painful and maybe even a bit lonely but it made the hair on my neck stand up! It was at an estimated range of a couple of miles perhaps They were able to see red eyes reflected in the lighting and porch light  I turned my head to look out the driver’s window and saw some sort of animal running on all fours in the ditch to the left beside the back of the truck about 25 feet away We were walking on a dirt road through some deep woods that turned into two Christmas tree farms the road went through some Christmas trees that were old maybe 15 + yrs Live pretty far into the foothills of the cascades near Cinebar, WA I sat on top of the picnic table with my feet on the bench (my son was over to the left of me, taking close up pictures of some flowers on the ground) and I was looking across Baker Lake to the other side of the lake with my binoculars As it walked it swayed it's arms back and forth as I watched in amazement There was about a four to four and a half foot stride between footprints (we had a tape measure) Within fifty feet of me He would keep looking out towards the dark, out towards the trees, and would be very nervous There I was, by myself, in the middle of this isolated forest road with a hairy (it seemed almost like semi-glossy fur?) cinnamon-colored shoulder and arm unhidden by the tree it was behind It was dark brown with sort of reddish highlights to it The footprints came from the direction of our camping sight, and then at the bend in the road, angled off toward the creek and just kept going into the trees lining the bank of the creek My wife recorded about 22 seconds of footage of the overall sighting  The arms looked a bit longer than a human but not more than half a hand length longer Hair on legs seemed to be around 5 or 6 inches long, and swung back and forth with leg motion I noticed he had a strange way to walk: His head was down like he was looking at his feet and his arms which seem very long (the hands were at the same level than the knees) were moving amply I saw a pinkish tan color hands and feet running real fast cause I was traveling 40 mph just black darkness except for the hands and feet then my headlights moved upwards and I caught sight of the black head to ankles all in black fir like a bear but was not a bear they were about nine to 10 feet in height only seen them for about six to eight seconds befor they ran off into the forest. While at the bog, something dark and large moved behind the reeds/ tall plants there, about 10 yards from where we stood I don't think that there would be footprints, as the ground is extremely rocky there, and it has rained heavily since then  The color in the headlights was a darkish brown, pepper Observation: Color was a light almost oak colored not black from head to foot, from that distance it was hard to judge height but I would guess around seven feet maybe more i have also found some footprints, but never got around to taking pictures of them, except for one that i found after my sighting, and it might not be one it just had the general shape It actually made my eyes water Because it never got down I thought it a transient person, but if it was a transient they were dressed in a dark parka with the hood pulled up and were wearing alot of bulky clothing with the tempature above 70 It was about eight feet away from me We both stood still and listened to the footsteps walk by us Some of the branches had been freshly torn off trees at least 10 feet off the ground, and arranged in a loafish shape By the time we arrived at the location and prepared all of our gear it had become completely dark The hole was about 2 to 3 feet wide :) My impression, one HUGE Chewbacca/Harry and the Hendersons kinda guy, at least 2.5-3 ft thick thru the chest from back to front and if I had to estimate would be tall even for a Sasquatch at 9-12 ft like I said it was a quite a ways up the road, but I had time to see it, evaluate, and question it and look again, and then again after that as it looked to the right at me coming down the road, so it was a pretty firm sighting even if I am still questioning myself the next day We were in a lifted Toyota Tacoma, I'm about 6'4 and the truck was taller than me  After checking the equipment to make sure it was locked up, they were looking to see what might be out in the clear cut (like deer, elk, bear, etc.), when they saw three sets of red colored eyes close to the ground, in the open,  just to the left of the spur road So, I moved the chair around and found that there was only one narrow opening through the trees where the ""stump"" could have been and there was no getting around the fact that it was not there Found a fresh footprint approximately 18"" or so long, and about 8"" across maybe? I have photographs and witnesses. Rainer and at the gate it has a sign that says the only known sighting of Bigfoot Its back end was taller than the front.on all fours It had big eyes like a gorilla maybe The eyeshine was an orangeish glow THE FIGURE WAS VERY DARK IN COLOR BUT ALMOST LOOKED BALDING IN SOME PLACES ON THE BODY We both agreed that we had just witnessed and heard a bigfoot! The next day, after calming down considerably, we went back to the spot and found several high tree limbs bent and broken by something very large and very tall  At first, I assumed it was a drunk woman who we had picked up wandering out in the dark forested highway the week  before (she was drunk and her boyfriend had kicked her out of his truck to walk home in the dark) Also less hair under the armpit We never did find them it was starting to get dark so we decided to head home and that was the last of that one  My house is situated at the highest elevation in the development, right around 700 feet and near the water tower First off, it was very dark, and oddly devoid of cars, as there is usually someone flashing their lights at me as my car has a headlight out and I have been driving with my brights on until payday to get it fixed He just cocks his head completely to his side and up to meet our eyes instantly! And holds my eyes in his, while he is still walking...Then He goes behind a tree line between us and that's when I say ""I think its Time to Go"" I then moved on via foot to an area I haven’t hunted yet and after about a ten minute walk I saw a track on the ground that looked like a human bare foot mark in the dirt  It was gray(light colored)big, human shape, visible right in front of our car no more than 15 feet from the front bumper Then I notice that they were ""dressed"" in a uniform dark colour from the top of their heads to the tip of their hands and legs (I couldn't see their feet because I was below them) We had gone in at about 4am in the cover of darkness it was large and hairy and moved like a mother [It moved fast] The news said something like this: ""Bigfoot tracks found crossing the Nisqually River near Mt Rainer,"" and they showed photos of the spot but did not say exactly where, but by the size of the river in the photos they showed it looked very close to where we were. I then noticed a movement of dark brown( a leg) and then a face We were a quarter mile from the road, it was 1 am and we were standing on a large log, all three of us a few feet apart, casting When all of a sudden a very loud and definitive type howl comes from the back of the ranch house, definitely not coyotes, followed by 3 huge grunts, the fence is 100 feet from the back of the ranch house, not much of a fence, but that was my judgement of distance However, it did raise my interest in the matter, and I have been reading and researching Bigfoot since then (the other squad members may have talked about it-I didn't and went ETS not long after). I observed long arms swinging with the hands bent backwards like if you were swimming, as it walked quickly to the base of the bank next to the road  There is a creek at the north end of the property, about 200 feet from where our rig was parked  I was sitting in my camp chair and I heard some 'clicking' sounds about 100 feet back into the forest I listened for footfalls or scrub noise to see if I could tell if something was coming closer I was too frightened with the realization that what I had just heard was impossible- impossible! No creature existed that could make that sound-- unless-- no way-- NO WAY! Then I remembered that this area had quite a few sightings of Bigfoot over the years I was having a hard time believing what I was seeing so I tried to look for boots on its feet or a coat Driving in my car on the highway, my friend and I saw a dark figure ahead of us walking up on a bluff beside the road But considering the surrounding area, Oyhut State Game Refuge is very close and only 6 miles away is thick forested area to the north,one of these creatures could travel that distance easily in the cover of darkness I didn’t even realizing I was hearing anything until it lasted more than a few seconds…and I realized it was moving in the same direction as me and breaking sizable tree branches underfoot And this gave me a great idea of how tall this thing was Tallik's young sons were sleeping out in their back yard in a tent, when they heard their dog Heidi, start to whine The stride is approximately 3 ft and the offset from left to right is about 1 ft At the river edge, in a sandy area we found barefoot prints…small, maybe 9” but with strange toes As he arrived and turned off his motorcycle engine, he observed something dark in color moving on an open hillside below a timber line  I then saw a dark, hairy figure walking upright along the side of the mountain, away from me the trees were up rooted some were twisted bend down twisted broken off about 7 foot up the tree  Though this foot print could have been made by a man, it was way too big and wide It may seem a little bit late to be reporting this, but it just recently occurred to me that it may be of some help to those who are tracking bigfoot Upon request of Chris Bradley (BFRO investigator) I am submitting this report of what I believe to have been an encounter with a Bigfoot or Sasquatch One day, lost to memory, they hiked about 2 miles above the lake, off the eastern side trail and, reaching a small meadow area with a 200 foot ledge overlooking the lake, they decided to roll large 2-man boulders over the ledge, into the lake The dock goes into the brush where fresh water collects during rain season and just ends, is about 20 feet long and begins at the edge of the yard which is also the NW corner of the deck support In that instant when I heard those sounds on TV I decided that we had heard a bigfoot and for about the next half an hour I had goosebumps going up and down my body (my wife was shocked/amused about how shaken up/freaked out I was) It was around 8 to 9 feet tall and very large The scarey part is, we have crashed enough hooved ungulates through the woods to know the sound of four legs crunching snow  It did not show fear and for the life of me I don't remember seeing its eyes, yet my son who was starting to cry kept saying ""look at its eyes"" There was no indentation in the pumpkin indicating that it had been rolled across about 10 feet of gravel driveway I smelt this awful musty skunky smell and the hair on the back of my neck stood up I laid down and closed my eyes and just waited till light broke through the trees  It ran on two legs, had very long swinging arms and a flat face Because of the temperate rain forest conditions that we experience the forest floor was covered with moss, and rotten vegetation making it difficult to cut sign on an actual footprint I strained my eyes to see what had thrown it thinking that after telling several of my customers of the earlier incident that maybe someone was playing a trick or something Joe Hester called me about some footprints that they found after setting up an elk hunting camp  Their faces were dark brown also I don't tell many people this story unless they talk about bigfoot first because as you know most people who have not encountered something like this themselves will not believe you anyways. Suddenly I hear guttural low pitched screams coming from the ridge above us, which I estimate about three hundred feet up We drove until we found a road that was seperated by just a ten foot ravine from the freeway and still it started, this time more distant in the forest Within a couple of seconds I heard a crack which sounded like a tree branch snapped and simultaneously the horses (still looking left) looked a bit right and through the underbrush I could see the back of a tall being (Bigfoot) that stepped out and  moved a tree aside to continue through the woods  He never saw the animal stand up, but estimated that if it stood erect it would have been about five feet tall There's a large lump like bunion or something on the side of each foot in some of the prints but not others  My guess and it is only a guess,  is that he was about 7-8 feet tall That's when I stopped; I realized it was not a stump, I could see its arms, legs, and even some detail of it face It was solid black or dark brown The road was in an area that was still within the Olympic National Forest, and the woods were so thick on each side of the road that it was difficult to see more than a few feet into the woods to the north Creature description: The creature we both saw was at least 7 feet tall, possibly more, had bright red eyes, which kind of glowed in the near dark light conditions that we were in We went back two weeks later to take pictures, foot prints were gone and looked like it rained. As I approached the car I got an eerie feeling that something was watching me so I turned around to look and there across the road from me, was a tall hairy creature looking at me As it continued across the ridge, I noted that the animal was walking on two legs  At the time I was about 32 years of age and had heard of sasquatch or bigfoot but had never had any thoughts about them My friend who was quite frightened, said ""what the hell was that?"" I believe my response was something like "" A damned bigfoot At first I thought it was a man dressed up in a dark brown fur suit I ask my wife if the noise was a coyote since she know them better than I do, she said, ""no, hell no I have never heard that before"" after we got inside I had her listen to a few audio clips, cougars,wolves, and then bigfoot clips on the site (1973,1978) she said that those clips sounded identical  What we saw definetly was not human, it was hairy from head to toe and was large, I don't know how tall I am positive that I saw something definately not human but quite graceful on two legs  Just past the clearing of our site, I could make out a tall shape and some gray fur, on something that stood maybe 7 to 9 feet tall (It was so deep that one horse walked out over on top of the barbed wire fence, without a scratch on him.) My BF (boyfriend, not BigFoot) worked late, and would not get home til 10 or 11, and we'd go out to feed most nights around midnight or shortly thereafter  No other animal could run on two legs with arms swinging the way this did The smaller one darker than the bigger one AND did NOT even look for foot prints of any kind The meadow was surrounded by trees and was about a football field in length I am a huge bigfooter, and I went on a night investigation right on the border of Lost River in the Methow Valley  We could not find any footprints, but could see where something large ran through the tall grass they said oh it could of been bigfoot jokingly until i told them the sounds that we were hearing all night and they said that we should probably go then cause that sounds really creepy and that theyve heard of reports in the area of a ""bigfoor"" in the past I had been seeing animals all night so I was really keeping my eyes open It was standing on two legs No Bigfoot footprints it was loud and deep,it was lighter and if i had to sat what color id say it had dark brown in places and reddish in places it had huge hairy legs i couldnt see its feet much  the littler one stood up and they walked slowly up the hill stopping every 50 ft and looking at me This creature which turned in front of me less than 6 feet away, was a real hulk, big barrel-chested, massive arms and shoulders, and the really impressive fact was it never made a sound when it turned to leave, it just seemed to float away I was in the lead, going around a tree in the trail when I came face to face with a large creature, with bright red eyes, which were at least 24 inches over my head When it happened I knew darn well what it was its bigfoot. It had reddish brown hair and as it crossed the road its arms were swinging in an almost exagerated motion We lived in Hoquiam at the time, and got a late start, so it was full dark when we arrived the next evening An Absolute black mass in pitch dark forest, move from one side of the camp to the other  Then one set of eyes rose up to be about six feet above the road I am having a house built and I had the drain field all dug up for the septic system installation In attendance were various members of both WABFR (Washington Bigfoot Field Research Group) & a majority of WA-BFRO researchers As soon as the rock landed this (and its still hard to say) bigfoot did not jump or run or seem scared at all, it just turned towards the dark timber behind it and walked into the forest I get hairs standing on my neck right now just typing this A wind break of poles about 6' tall was beside us and a head was moving along on the far side of it In a clearing we noticed lots of tracks of wildlife then some large foot prints on left side of road  It was five feet away,but down on the ground, looking up at her All re-creations were completed by me within two to three weeks after the encounter (late August to early September 2007)          Link to Canadian artist Brian Cundle's poster rendition of the sighting event: http://northamericanbigfoot.blogspot.com/2010/09/brian-cundle.html ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- More details, potential insight & subjective interpretations from my perspective regarding the subject during the encounter As I stood there in my drift boat watching the line slowly peel off of the reel, I couldn’t help but feel confused about what could possibly be attached to the other end when it stood up in the middle of the river 30 feet below my boat and seemed, by the glowing corkies and sand shrimp, to be hooked in the left shoulder and not at all comfortable with the whole situation, nor where either of the two gentlemen in the front of my boat  Shocked, I found myself looking at very large boulder close to 3 feet long and maybe 2.5 feet thick that wasn't there a few moments before  It walked with long strides and it's arms & hand swung in an long swings as it walked The animal was completely covered with hair with long arms Away from the streetlights on a moonless night with old pine/fir trees looming overhead, my eyes couldn’t see a damn thing After about our third visit there, we noticed a different phenomenon, just after dark, we would hear the sound of large rocks being clicked together, usually starting on the far side of the river, and then answered with similar clicking from off in the woods on our side This was probably a distance of 40 feet I thought at first it was a person because it was on two legs and how it seemed to lean on the shed (like a human) Later in my life the movie Bigfoot came out and I went to see the movie  It was dark and too far away to see its face  As I got closer, it looked like they were wearing dark colored full body wetsuits with hoods It was probably 20 feet wide and 20 feet high, but maybe only 10 feet deep  Witness says the creature was approx 7-8 foot tall and could see its arms swinging back and forth as it walked down a ridge The figure was probally 7 feet tall (i doubt it was 8 or 9) dark in color, and very large in build. So I finally said, “We have to look up Bigfoot sounds...it’s the only thing left.” She looked at me and nodded The creature is described as having a uniform length of thick auburn-brown hair all over except for the mouth and eyes You could see the blood and matted hair This maneuver took all of 5 seconds and by the time I got the lights on the center of the lot all I could see was the motion of something bipedial and very large throwing it's legs over the concrete barrier at the back of the lot about 60 feet from us pivoting on one hand like a gymnist going over a pommel horse and gone in an instant the two males stood still motionless they watched me and did not talk much to the female that was doing most of the talking in her own dialect the males seamed to motion to her to keep quite then the clouds had covered up the rays of light and it got dark again  It was not as tall as I had heard that they were, maybe 7'0"" at the most It was about 7-71/2' tall My mother claims the creature was like a hideous ape with arms dragging I grabbed a flashlight and tried to talk him into showing me where he had seen it but he refused to go outside, insisting I was crazy because he said it must have been at least 7 foot tall So dark that we couldn't see the lake when we first got there Every time I suggested that we head on down I was cut off by the local home owner telling me that we were in the hot spot and he wanted to try it longer and to quit being a baby, that there was no such thing as bigfoot Taking a closer look shining my light on the tracks they were spaced about 4 1/2 feet apart Under the circumstances we could only surmise that we had just seen a Bigfoot that was apparently going across the road to reach the river Next thing we heard was feet walking in the snow, very loud crunching His boss took the crew out of the area because they are afraid of this Bigfoot By the time the Sheriff investigated my report, the footprints that I had found were pretty well ""washed"" out from melting and rain....but, the Sheriff and his boys found MORE prints beyond our campsite...2 different sets (the second set was smaller) It landed about8 feet from me Moved very quickly, having a smooth and graceful gait."" Also, she has seen his eyes glowing in the head lights of her car coming home at night tall They describe it as being 6'6"" tall (as measured against a branchlet that barely touched the crown of its head), covered with black-gray fur and golden brown patches on its shoulders and chest I have never heard anything walk so loudly and it seemed to be moving quickly It sounded like it was heavy and was on 2 legs. Later on we continued on the trail and we came across another foot print that was slightly smaller but it had been stepped on by someone and it was only a partial print I had been fishing for around a half hour when Steve got bored and started around the lake, he was on his way back when from behind us across the road where we had to park came a very loud gutteral howling accompanied by grunting and sounds of anger, some bushs were being totally thrashed, this caught us extremly off guard and we just looked in the direction for some time waiting to see what had made the sounds I was panting, standing straight and looking straight into the darkness I was escorted to one of these spurs and was shown two large, what appeared to be footprints with human features in an area along the base of a fire trail It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up When asked why they did that they replied that all the other boys were doing it also because they saw footprints in the snow first I finally said, I think it's a bigfoot  I didn't really notice if they had fur or hair Sometime before this - maybe 6 months - on the TV news was a story of a tour bus driver up in British Columbia, Canada that had to hit the skids to keep from hitting a Bigfoot that crossed the road in front of him The third day, I came out of the cabin to go make lunch and there was a hairy animal standing next to and somewhat leaning on the shed behind the trailer A hair was removed from between the second & third toes of the left track & sent to the ""Institute of Cryptozoology"", in Tucson, Arizona for analyzation The only thing I can guess is the driver of the car looked down to mess with something on his dashboard and took his eyes off the road for the 2 to 2.5 seconds it took the creature to turn and retreat I asked my friend to put his foot next to it to compare I needed to urinate, so I stood up and walked to my right rear about 20 feet where a path led down to a stream, I could hear and see the slow moving shallow water in this shallow pea gravel bedded creek, I did my thing and returned to the fire It was like he was tired (because of the position of the head) and alert (because of the movment of his arms and legs) in the same time! At one moment the first one who was walking about 10 meters ahead stopped to look at the second one but didn't wait for him and continue to walk This is written from the view of someone who at the time of this incident knew very little of big foot, and really didn't give them any thought I was telling a friend about it not to long ago, it never occurred to me that it could have something to do with Big Foot It also had to be tall enough to reach the window Friday Oct 22, 9:40 pm I had just left our local school homecoming football game in Springdale Washington, with 2 of my children and a friend of theirs (2 High School freshman and a mid schooler) As I was turning truck around I was looking over my shoulder out the window and noticed a large dark hairy animal walking upright pass about 50 ft  Its build consisted of exceptionly broad shoulders, long burly arms which dangled at its sides, and a waist easily twice as large I was So I searched the Internet for bigfoot sounds and found your sight Its arms were very long with the fingers of the creature just above the knee It was 24 degrees outside, snowing, the roads were icy and snow packed, and it was dark, there were no street lights It watched me for about 30 seconds, then very slowly walked to another tree about 20 feet away from the first tree He stated it was not thin, as thick as a tree trunk, but, what is even more puzzling, is that he has stated that it was a light grey or whitish color and Very Very ""hairy."" What do you think?  Big Foot or just some big animal (Bear) or kids swinging in a tree?  It is a corporate park completely cut off from where kids play, so I doubt that They were just the toes and part of the ball of the foot Was it big and muscular or tall and skinny?  B I looked to my left as I neared the curve in the road and what I believe to be a bigfoot was crouched down getting water from the swampy area We observed them individually, and in silence as we were all really convinced, staring at each other with flat-affects and big eyes As the group stopped and turned, we ran back maybe 20 feet to rejoin the group It was white or perhaps gray with red eyes I scanned the area with my eyes and binoculars and did not see it again The 'person' was extremely tall and broad  The eyes moved from the left of the road up, onto the road  The hair on my neck stood up As I said, I do not really believe in Bigfoot, I just don't know what it was My friend was convinced it was Bigfoot that night but I wasn't sure because it was on all 4's & wasn't brown or black  And THERE IT WAS!!  MY PROOF!!  That I was not insane and hearing things!! Half way between the fire pit and our door, right at the edge of the little gravel walkway was a lone footprint!!  About 15” long It seemed so musclular and it's legs did not straighten but remained bent My great uncles eyes went totally wide and white, then both my aunt and great uncle said they would like us inside We went out there that Saturday armed with my new video camera, and stalked around until looking for tracks or anything until it started to get dark First, my hunting partner and I were washing in a stream on the FR88 out of Trout Lake, and we both saw a very clear footprint on the side of the stream It appeared to be 7-8' tall and covered in dark hair He was taller than the picture window because he was bending to see in I looked at the ""tree trunk"" and the hair on the back of my neck stood up, I was about 25 yards from it and it looked like it had eyes and they moved I couldnt tell how tall it was but I could tell it was massive  We could not have made more than 20 feet when it let out a scream that to this day still sends chills through me  The left arm swung in huge, deliberate strokes, and other than the feet swishing, we heard no noise On the last day of hunting season just before dark my friend and I were walking slowly on an old logging road It was very hard to keep calm, but I knew almost as soon as I saw those red eyes what this creature must be Tallik told me that ""She came down the road honking her horn, pulled into the driveway and jumped out of her car and ran to the front door yelling 'Mom!' in a very frightened voice As it turned out, my sister and her husband, took the safe way out and set up camp in their Dodge Caravan, while I pitched our miniscule backpacking tent 50 feet South of the camp in a small clearing surrounding by small pines He now saw what appeared to be a large, black, hairy upright ape.. I would say that the prints looked like size 12 or 13 feet Crazy werent they! We set up camp fairly close to the end of the road, about 50 feet from the river  It was very dark and we decided not to try and find out what the noise was, as it was quite some distance away It looked as though a tall dark man was standing behind a tree  Given (a) the modest size of the footprint, (b) the popular nature of the trail and (c) the fact that there were many ""hippy"" types in the area, I assumed it was just a very casual hiker  It was then that an enormous creature stood up suddenly, from what I presume to have been a squatting position, from behind the hedge of thimbleberries, no more than three feet away from me  She moved her feet  This animal was within 70 feet of me so it was clear and fairly loud (as loud as an amplified siren we use at work) I saw bigfoot run across the highway Eyes were about 3 to 4 inches apart range, I don't know any man thats man enough to take on that feet  I didn't actually see anything, but having climbed up there to get a view, I was warned in no uncertain terms -- a grunting hum with a stamping of feet The trees blocked the upper part of the body but I could see the lower part of the legs, I didn't see any boots or shoes or clothing They were not talking, just taking in the scenery when a black, 8' tall creature got up from a stoop on the left side of the trail and ran away, leaving a foul odor  It was a big stride, arms swinging, just as the video of the sasquatch that was spotted in the late 60’s down in Eureka, California But since we didn't have any other choice to get off the mountain before dark and since it was almost dark now we decided to go down the logging road very quietly as not to get caught on their land (this small road system is their own private operation and none of these roads go far or are connected to any other roads) to the valley below  It was totally black, like a black bear The skin was black and leathery around the nose and eyes and the ears were pointed and protruded through the hair on the side of the head As heavy as the footsteps were it seemed as if what ever it was it had about the same weight as a small horse, 600lbs Helens to look for Bigfoot It had been dark for a couple hours and had been raining all day We were shooting our rifles, yelling, banging pots, and this creature just kept on making these horrible screams, similar to the screams I have since heard of Bigfoot on recordings We heard distinct heavy footfalls running back down the ridge ????? I dont know Im just very uneasy about going there again, and everytime I talk about it to people and all my  hair starts to stand on end.. The only thing going through my mind was bigfoot, so just to be safe I loaded a 30-06 cartridge into my chamber  After I saw this thing cross the highway I marked the location on Google Maps: (https://goo.gl/maps/nS15Gx3jcaVgdtPy9) but I was driving so give or take a couple thousand feet It's shoulders would have extended a full foot beyond it's width and it's chin would have been the only thing seen below the celling Just getting dark Seen, Large 8'+ tall manlike hairy creature at a distance of 60 - 70' for between 45 sec the car stalled and my wife became hysterical and so I left and returned the next day to look for tracks. This time my sister and mom noticed we were stopping, and my mom said ""What are you guys doing, come on lets get going"" and we said ""We think we're being stalked"" and my mom said ""oh yea? by what one of those Sasquash things we saw down by the farms?"" And we said ""Yeah listen, start walking"" so we started walking and after a couple steps, we heard the heavy steps in the woods again Well, I must admit to being rather surprised to ever find myself to be putting together a ""report"" of big foot activity If it was an owl, it would have to be 10 feet tall I really don't know if this was a Bigfoot encounter or not but I don't know how else to explain it It was about 50 feet ahead of me when I first saw it We had parked to stretch our legs a bit and were standing next to Monte Cristo lake in Snohomish county.. The mother went to see for her self and found 19"" human like tracks in two feet of snow It was running on the side of the hill, taking large steps, kind of striding on two legs when I reached a full stop the creature seemed to pivot on its left leg while swinging its arms turned to the left and took one step to the opposite side of the road and disapeared from view It may have been a bear but it looked like a large hairy man (no neck to speak of or really any hair on the face) and it walked upright taking strides as a man To provide some size reference I put my foot next to the track  It was taller then the average black bear and stood like a man There were no distinct pointed ears that I could see and thought it was too dark in color and too large to be a cougar It was totally silent -- which it normally is around here at night -- and as I sat there on the wooden steps, with Icy sitting on the deck about 3 feet away from me, I heard what at first sounded like a distant siren, seemingly from the north-north-east He looked like he was walking downhill with his arms swinging At this point I started to think maybe it was a Bigfoot but actually hoping not  His eyes looked deep into mine for at least 2 seconds  It had hair/fur of a uniform length of about 3 inches all over The valley was full of farms  I was transfixed by the legs When it stopped, it stood straight up (on two feet like a man), and held its arms and hands close to its side There were no trees on the trail to confirm that impression but they really seemed to me very tall, specially the second one The ""stump"" looked to be about 7-8 feet tall and at least 3 feet wide After reading the incodent that happened to the four hunters in Kid Valley Toutle area, I feel I have to describe my encounter with what I thought was a Bigfoot in 1980 when my family and I had just moved here from California It was anywhere from 8’5” to 8’9” tall and about 3'6"" wide (I came back and measured a week later based on the tree branch it held on to) In order to see into this window the ""thing"" would have to be very tall, at least seven feet tall and there is no object outside for it to stand on I wanted to go check for footprints however I'm disabled and walking in the woods would be hard plus I was terrified as well. While doing this they noticed a dark upright animal with a reddish tint, standing at the meadow's forest edge, peeking out at them from behind a tree As we approached the main line road we noticed this creature to the right.It was about 80 yards away,and it started moving away from us very fast.The creature disappeared around a bend in the road about 125yards away.We sat there for a half a minute looking at each other in disbelief.Then we took off down toward where he went around the bend.When we got there the creature was about 200 yards down the road.It looked back towards us and went into the brush.When we got down there we shut the truck off and could hear rustling brush for about 20 seconds,but we couldn't see it.That was that.I grew up my whole life out in the woods,hunting, fishing,and hiking.I know all the animals in the area well,we know what we saw.It was unbelievable,we were close enough to get a good look at it.I was 18 at the time,now Im 36 and i can still see its face,its body,and its walk.The creature was at least 7'-8' tall,with long brownish red hair.It was a sasquatch,for sure.We never really talked about it to many people.All i know is these things are out there. I thought what or who is that, I could see that it was very tall over 8feet and it had dark hair the head was smaller than the shoulders but it had no neck packbacks and our tail between our legs I started to walk to our trail (about 30 feet away) to see if I could see my partner or what was making the noise when i could hear the brush crashing and some mumbling noise me and my wife were on a sunday drive in the spring time we were returning to a area I had lost a pair of prescription sunglasses while snowmobiling the previos winter When arriving at location I had to hike up dirt road to look into next drainage where my glasses were lost the road still had two feet of snow on the shady side of hill as I hiked up road I noticed another set of foot prints going up the same road I went over to foot prints and noticed the depth of foot print was over twice the depth of my foot print and the stride was four to five feet long going up hill in deep snow Im six foot five and weight 245 pounds my stride was about one foot going up hill I followed the foot prints to the top where the sun had melted the snow The hair/fur appeared to be about 2-3 inches long Turned out that it just ran off into the woods, but it was hairy and ran upright on two legs I told my son, who was to my left and about ten feet from me, that I hear two hunters coming toward us and we'll let them come up so they know we are there His arms were long, his eyes were reddish brown as was his hair It had seemed like seconds before it reached the top of the hill maybe an eighth of a mile away and remained there for several minutes making a noise that had every hair on your entire body standing at perfect attention We had decided to make a day of shooting so we brought an automatic trap machine, several boxes of biodegradable clay pidgions, LOTS of shotgun shells in trap loads, chairs, a folding table, plenty of food and drinks (coffee, water, fruit juices, tea) however...no alcohol because my friend and his wife are diabetic and I take meds that don't mix well with alcohol But we knew if we cut straight down the mountain right where we were that we would make it to the valley below before dark  After it had disappeared, the thought of the stride struck me as odd I cried the whole way home thinking I had just killed the only Bigfoot there was, and still there is no doubt that's what I saw On August 29, !992 my husband and I found a series of five footprints in a dried up boggy area, about 1 1/2- 2 miles past Jefferson Lake in the Hamma Hamma Recreation Area in Jefferson Co., Wa He was in full sprint; legs outstretched, heckles up, growling fiercely (and he was a gentle giant, he only acted that way towards squirrels/coyotes/raccoons)  What did I see?  I saw nothing because it was pitch black dark But I am glad that I went to the noises, because I got to see what was making it.When I yelled at my Mom that I was looking right at a little Bigfoot,It stopped making the sounds, let go of the trees & turned around(away from me)I think it hit 2 trees with it's hands or fists on the way,because there were 2 very very loud thuds & the trees shook.It moved really fast into the under growth & it looked like it got down on all fours as it ran away very fast & made all kinds of crashing sounds She was awakened by a metallic bang on the back porch and then crunching footsteps going towards the driveway When my car started up the object quickly turned and strided off into the timber When we got there it was very obvious that tracks were out of the question as the hill top was the old graveled road that had in the past been used to install the towers, a hard pack ground As I tried to focus on the location of this ""event"", I recognized that there was a pair of ""eyes"" looking directly at me It had disproportionately long legs and even longer arms which hung to just above mid thigh Thereupon the sasquatch screams, takes a step across the creek toward them, while holding its arms out to the side by about 45 degrees, as if to herd them on their way The arm had black hair all the way to the knuckles My hunting partner and I were driving a remote section of road after dark to try and find concentrations of deer tracks to hunt some new areas about twenty miles from Canada and forty miles north of the aformentioned incidents Never thought to look for footprints. Then, in my middle rear view mirror, I saw a sasquatch peak around a tree about 60 feet away It ran through the brush on two legs taking huge steps each time and busted through the brush like it was nothing and disappeared over the hill in seconds It made the hairs on the back of their necks stand up Four of us kids we were all looking the same way when all of a sudden 30 feet away something something stepped from the clearing in full view of us took one step maybe six feet an dissapeared behind a bush it was id say eight feet tall hairy it took one step and was gone .We alllooked at each other an ran home nobody beleived us the said it may have been a hunter or something  Div., I had an encounter with, what I believed to be a bear, but now I know it was a bigfoot There was no lope, stride, or gallop that resembled how this thing sounded when it moved  The exact area cannot be remembered at this time, but it was a couple hours before dark approx 6:30-7:00 P.M., and we were traveling down a dirt road, that inclined and turned slightly to the left, and there was a branch (logging) road that dropped slightly down and to the right as the main road went left As I looked closer I realized this ""PERSON"" was far taller than a human and the strides while walking were quite long  I turned to see, very quickly, a very large dark brown shaggy form tearing-down a branch as it turned and almost instantly disappeared into the treeline As Dan observed this thing, he noticed it was quite tall, seven feet or more in height As the creature walked, I noticed it never quite straightened its legs, yet it had a graceful stride The hair is 4""-5"" long and dirty with burrs in it They were both dark brown in color from head to toe I was a leading us out and stumbled upon a very clear muddy print of a left foot Literally seconds after that the same two deer sprinted past us within just 5 to 7 feet as if we werent there and the least of the their concern and his children (my friends) were sleeping in a tent, located about 30 feet away from our vehicles As we ran, the final HOOOOOOT!! came from behind us, streaking thru thigh high fieldgrass, I was sure that I was seconds away from having my arms ripped off by a mountain devil As we were driving about 60 yards down the road, we see a black creature that i would say to be around seven feet tall come running up the the steep bank and across the road at an unhuman speed My dog and I hiked a short way in from the road and I was down on my hands and knees cutting mushrooms when my dog came over to me and tried to get as close as he could.I was mad at him because he was stepping on the mushrooms.I recall getting a whiff of very putrid smelling air.The smell was overpowering almost like something had died with an overtone of rotting garbage.I stood up to see where the smell was comming from and turned to my right and in doing so saw a large hairy creature standing in a fern patch about 200 feet away.We both made eye contact about the same time and I was so startled for a few seconds I had to rationlize what I was seeing Lots going on in that set of eyes that I remember to this day 5 years later... It has impressively wide shoulders (""Man, they were this wide!"", Nick holds his hands far apart in retelling), heavy arms, wide hands with thick fingers and dark brown and rough palms Two friends and myself decided to go camping in my ""backyard"" which happens to be 10 acres in the foot hills of Van Zandt All of the footprints I was looking at by the lake had a mid-tarsal break He saw the animal's legs step up to climb higher up the slope He remarked about the size of its arms in comparison to the rest of its body Our distance at this point is between 22 to 25 feet  At about 3:00 pm all three of us were talking on the front porch when Vic (the friend) suddenly stiffened and stared looking very intently up at a nearby foothill, and called our attention to something ""funny"" moving around up there 60 feet in diameter I would stop and look into the brush but to thick and saw something DARK but no outline  We jokingly said maybe we should look for Big Foot prints or hair in the area As I approached the area I spotted the movement along the highway and he looked at me and said ""bigfoot"" Remarkably, I do not recall actually seeing its feet from my vantage point during the entire encounter  I did not see a Big Foot, but I may have seen evidence of one  At about the same moment our dog came whimpering back all nervous acting and hanging under my feet I'd estimate the subject at 4-7 inches taller, but even conservatively estimating its size in comparison, it was about 3 times the total body mass of Paul G The trail was covered with packed snow from foot and horse traffic, and was fairly slippery in the cold weather The far bank is 20 feet high, covered with cedar, hemlock and brush We got to an interesting little part off the trail where a little waterfall was pouring off from a cliff above, maybe like 20 feet up  To this day I know that Bigfoot followed me up my driveway and then Bigfoot let me know what he was by the calls in the middle of the same night The left one was messed up, just like the 1st time! Dave and I were about 10-12 feet apart that showed what was supposed to be a nest of the Chinese version of Bigfoot I spent several more days there, doing additional research and recording, such as attempting to trace its path, compare my stride to the creature’s, and so on I have some very interesting video footage of this support data, including what I thought were resting beds underneath some of the trees I feel that what I saw was a Hairy Mountain Man that showed high intelligence, through the fact that he some how ""picked up on us"" watching him..  It stared right at me and I stared right back into its eyes My eyes were already adjusted to the dark, even though there were several outside lights in the main area I can't definitely say it was a Bigfoot because I only saw a head, but a human would probably not be across the lake peaking out from the side of a tree It was foggy and we had never been on this road before, so we had stopped pick-up and got out to check the road ahead on foot The hominid was covered in very black hair, with noticable bare areas across the chest and hip area As the slope was buried in several feet of snow it had to be something large to displace the rocks I got up to go relieve myself while looking at the creek when I spotted something walking across the creek about twenty feet away from my truck It was so close could hear the thuds of its feet on the ground I knew that this wasn't normal cause the left foot where the big toe is looked like it was being dragged  About 200 feet down I lost the tracks and noticed my battery on my camera was almost dead, searched my pack, like a dummy I had left it back in my camera bag in the car  Truck was about 20 feet from State Hwy 7 On the next stop they noticed a trail of large footprints going up the bank I was a little more than two miles from the BZ corner junction when I saw a set of eyes reflecting on the opposite side of the road [Hubert & Doris Smith residence] Shortly after this, the school bus driver reported seeing a bigfoot cross the road in front of the bus  I have always believed that there is bigfoots running around I was far too freaked out at this point two investigate further especially because it was getting dark I got my binoculars to my eyes and looked at it and it still looked exactly like the pictures you see that people draw Investigator: You don’t think it’s walking with its knuckles? Witness: Everything else moved but the arms didn't As we were walking back to truck I noticed foot prints going uphill from the road in an area we had walked not more than 10 minutes before But what caught my attention was how these tracks were so unusual, they did not look like some random people were walking around barefoot in the mud The hairs on my neck stood up It was in the middle of the winter time, with the weather close to 5 degrees, and encountered massive footprints that were made in the snow I estimated at that time of the weight being between  500-1000 lbs My friend told me to keep my foot into it or we may slide off! He said there is always a place to turn around at the top of these roads I never knew until now when I ran into this website that there is more sightings of bigfoot in that area than anywhere else in the US Light brown hair on its face with the tips almost dark brown The tracks looked about a few days old because I could tell they weren't fresh, but they were so unusual and looked so like the ones online that my instincts told me that these were not human footprints. It was about 6-7 feet tall no neck very wide  It walked with a purpose.It was so dark and so heavily wooded that I'm still amazed at how quikly it moved A large, dark, human-like form stood up and looked directly down at us  My family dismissed our claims, but I know there is no way it was anything else but a bigfoot Larry told all of us that he thought he heard a Bigfoot howling (my husband is an extreme skeptic when it comes to anything related to Bigfoot) My husbands boots were size 15, he is 6'8"" tall and weighs more than 200 lbs with a 38"" inseam I have always been interested in Bigfoot (for the past 50 yrs), but I never associated this incident with them  The stride was 4 ½ feet It took long stride's and was actually moving faster than me and I stopped the car because I thought it was going to come over the barbed wire fence into the road in front of me At first I thought it was one of my siblings but as my eyes adjusted to the light change I realized it was the hairy face I had seen in the picture window months before  I look and see two hairy creatures walking upright and they were almost a golden brown color.. Reached my car and got the camera battery and was ready to hike back out when I noticed that at the opposite end of the berm about 10 feet from where I had crossed earlier that some thing had crossed it and had slipped  I showed him the print before we poured the cast,  he agreed with me that it must be a bigfoot print  The creature ran in an up-right postion and swung it's arms in large arcs  While picking berries on Tonga Ridge on the 27th, I walked about a thousand feet northwest of the road where people never go, through the trees and brush, looking for a better berry spot, and saw a pile of what I thought was bear scat in an open place After I got around the ""corner"" I saw these ""huge"" depressions in the snow, and upon further examination decided they were footprints They were all very well defined and covered with short hair/fur (with the exception of the lower forehead, eyes and nose. As they continued walking, the ""sign"" followed them and they took off running as fast as they could as the dark figure followed along, walking at a seemingly leisurely pace, never breaking into a run, but easily keeping up with the boys It was not a bear as it walked on 2 legs There was hair on the brush that looked to be black  It starts off winding through woods and while curving to the right we saw this gigantic light brown to dark tan hairy figure cross from right to left There have been reported sighting of the Bigfoot around the Elwah River area from time to time and I am convinced that we were visited by one that night It was after midnight and was quite dark the fire was down to coals As I started to cast I felt very uneasy and continued looking up and down the river trying to see in the nighttime darkness when directly across the river from me I heard a baseball-sized rock hit the water a few feet off the far bank We did find some long dark hair on some barbed wire but I don't remember that we saved any I wear dark wool clothes and use the primitive equipment of the fur trade era I turned to my sister, and she said, "" Oh my God, there's someone throwing rocks!"", and by this time her ""brave"" husband was already well on his way back up to the car at a dead run, and we were right on his heals in a mad panic, slipping and sliding up the dark hill Subject of observation was ""Bigfoot Adult."" The Description on Form 10-257: ""Location on highway 123, 7 miles from Packwood, Washington  It had the characteristics of a human foot but was twice the width and the toes seemed like they where possibly 3 times the width I thought I was imaging everything and then began to walk toward the car but froze in my footsteps when I heard my unseen companion begin walking away from me The tracks, that seemed to be from the same source (none as clearly defined), went on heading north on the trail an additional 25-30 feet She seemed quite shaken by the event, and it was a long wait while it got dark, us there alone with no way out, and no car to hide in The next day it was pouring rain and I came across a bare footprint in the road Later the next year I had heard through my mom and dad that my uncle had seen some huge ""foot prints"" by the road when he investigated my bear sighting Being a little antsy and not much in a socializing mood, I took a walk down that back pathway about 100 yds, (which was pitch black on a dark night with plenty of tree cover) to relieve myself He continued to tell us what he had heard about Bigfoot and succeeded in getting us so nervous that we got in the car and left It was a brown red color, darker than a mountain lion I jumped up thinking it was an alarm and that the woods were on fire but the night was dark and no smoke so we listened to it and could tell it was some sort of animals 8) 10/13/75 Strong and pungent odor seemed to be lingering in the air, heavy footsteps heard in the front yard and on the wooden porch of the Tallik's From heel to heel to prints were 4 1/2 feet apart, tracks were approx 16 inches long It was 3 a.m., I having hard time sleeping went out onto 2nd floor deck which is about 10+ feet high  When Rob reached me, I told him that, ""That! was Bigfoot!"" He said, ""That's what I thought!"" I have seen documentaries on Bigfoot,  however, Rob never has, so he had no idea what Bigfoot might sound like.The area was the 520 GMU, but if you need more info The river erupted ten feet in front of us, a thunderous crack and then a soaking, knocking over one of our three lanterns I am still perplexed at this sighting as I clearly seen everything from Face, Head, Arms, Legs etc A little one,  a 6 footer, jumped over some rocks and logs and was gone, the big one sitting on its heels was 7-to 8 foot, 3-4 feet wide, It was not scared of me, I ran up river to find the girls, found them and said I wanted to show them something weird, as us three went back, sure enough it was still there  I was sitting in the middle seat and I saw a flash of HUGE eyes first in the headlights Hearing other recorded Bigfoot sounds, sort of reminds me of the sound we heard We were all much more aware of our surroundings, and kept our eyes and ears open there is one 3/4 of mile from the Tallik's home However, these were unmistakably bi-ped, and HUGE!I wear size 13 and they were at least 4"" longer than my insulated boot footprint there was no sound just all of a sudden a rock landed about 8 feet from us  I went back over to my chair and sat down I'd walked about 100 meters when I heard noises  to my right front that sounded like heavy foot steps and D.G.) and myself decided to try our hand at bigfoot ""hunting"" after hearing about the BFRO expedition to Skookum on the Medved radio show and then reading about it on the website i happened to glance up on the hill above me, which is 500 yards to the top, and i saw a tall black somthing walking around, but i didnt pay any attention to it, i figured it was my eyes playing tricks on me Joe and I kidded that we saw Big Foot but the more we think about it the more we don't think it was a bear Investigator: So would you estimate about 48 inches tall for the fern and the salal? Witness: About that tall Keep in mind, it was very dark and only a little illumination from the moon He walked away swinging his arms like that tape of Big Foot that came out and was played over and over. The prints were 19 inches long and 10 inches wide at the ball of the foot and sightings on bigfoot in the area When I did, I saw a large dark redish brown brown figure with long stringy hair, About 8.5' tall So I began working on my great uncles ranch, we all went to Bill's Hill directly behind the ranch to fix fence, at about noon that day, just after lunch while I was pounding in a fence post I looked up to ask my great uncle a question and I seen 2 trees, pine trees, that were at least 20 feet tall sway, I was looking I believe east and he west, the trees were 20 feet inside the fence line to the south, at the same time my uncle had evidently seen the swaying trees and came directly to me and stopped Both sets were made in hard packed river sand and appeared to have been the result of great weight being placed on each foot We didn't  come prepared with tape measures or anything like that, but my Husband is 5'9"" and he could only get to about half of the stride length  I had passed close enough to him to actually see the direction the fur was growing in! It was mostly all one direction (down)like a dog's hair, except around his eyes were it seemed to stick straight out. He had read the article in the newspaper about the footprints we had found, and called to see if we could get together Keep in mind, that I am a novice on this subject of ‘Bigfoot.’ I really did not have any idea originally what to really look for He disapeared quickly into a field of tall dry grass bordering the highway after the next vocalization I said to my husband it's Bigfoot and he stopped to listen I remember trembling and thinking I couldn’t believe my eyes At the end of that straight stretch we both saw a very large bipedal creature walk out of the woods on the north side of the road, stride across the road in three strides, and disappear into the woods on the south side of the road I did try to tell my mom when I got home what I found and that I thought it followed me to protect me, beacause I kept hearing the bushes move like there was something walking with me out of eyesight We had to spend the night in the car and right after dark we began hearing what sounded like hard wood beating on soft wood(like someone hitting a tree with a baseball bat) very close, maybe within 100 ft Then, about 20 minutes later, the neighbors dogs on the other side of the 5 acres of woods between us started losing their minds and barking their heads off, and almost immediatly, I heard 4 or 5 siren-like calls(think of the vocalization that you hear on the 1994 A&E Bigfoot documentary) It was walking upright, had a long lumbering gait, long arms, a large head, and walked mildly stooped at the shoulders, and appeared to be at least 8 feet tall This area is totally wild and all any creature would have to do is cross the Nisqually River for nearly complete solitude because of the washed-out bridge about 10-15 feet behind it another creature of the same size and color came running across at an ever faster speed  I was 16 at the time and an avid sportsman hunting in the woods by myself for years always going into my area to hunt before dark with no flashlight He was very dark, and his face was very clear  It was just getting dark As I approached the creek I saw a large footprint I am almost certain that if someone was to spend next spring and summer at beginner’s hole on the Kalama River between the hours of 10:00pm and 4:00am it will quite possibly change the way they view Bigfoot for the rest of there life! Thank You;  It is very dark, cant see your hand in front of your face They went over for a closer look and discovered that they were just like human's bare footprints with 5 toes there was a child to her left that stood about 6ft tall but was dwarft by the three larger adult creatures  We thought nothing of it after that- didn't suspect a bigfoot at all because that didn't cross our mind  There were no cars stranded on the side of the road that I could see (I had seen a few during my drive), only dark forest, so who were they and where were they coming from I thought Driving home around 3AM returning from my sister's house, I came around the bend on 'B' Street in Aberdeen, after (Stewart?) Park, when I saw a huge upright figure with dark fur When we got home I called the ""Bigfoot"" Society (1-800-bigfoot) and talked with some people there Just then he saw it and remarked to me, ""what the hell is that thing""? I said you ain't gonna believe this but that is a Bigfoot Full hair except around eyes I observed and took pictures of footprints on the road on my property in Eastern Washington  Not knowing about bigfoot at the time, I told the guys I was chased by a bear We came to a Bigfoot booth and I told the man about my story  It was very tall, dark brown hair, walked on two legs like a man but resembled a gorilla, (sort of) there was nothing on that gravel bar (no bones, no hair, nothing) I went on with my buisness and then ""Kane"" totally flipped out(Barking and everything), so i looked around and saw something real big jumping over the streets with like 2 steps and then vanishing in the woods(It was about 30yards away)  It took one long stride off the stump towards the tree line The longest step @ this location measured 9 feet between steps and only the ball of the foot was distinguishable @ the end of each 9' step The next day, I went out on foot to the spot and found the broken and trampled branches, the ripped tarp, the coyote carcass, the dog food bowl and the unknown animal scat It had rained that week however and no footprints were found We had fished until around 11am then hung out until around 8pm so we could use the darkness to get out  She said the creature was 8-9 feet tall, and moved like Andre the Giant stepping into a wrestling ring But I can say that animal had a stride not matched in North America  It was long after dark and I  was inside writing or something and heard a strange bellowing noise just off through the woods  Dark brown, almost black  Instead of a deer, here comes this guy that makes it across the road in three strides at a dead run We both know the Olympics has tons of Bigfoot reports so I would not any doubt it was a Bigfoot that threw the rock My dog jumped up into my arms and began shaking Size: ""taller than your father""; Note: My father is 6'9"".  My first reaction was that they were really tall and must be basketball players It looked like the right footprint but no others, we found the soil was too firm I took the protective cover of the one distinct footprint and again confirmed to myself that it was humanoid in its nature We estimate its overall height to be between five foot six inches to six feet tall I remember feeling scared to death and the hair on my body was standing up He had the exact same eyes  I had seen that same foot 17 years before, out on the sandbar, when it was only about 4” long!!!  OMG!!!  I was thrilled to pieces!!  But freaked out at the same time! I went to the rig, grabbed my cell phone and took 3 good pictures 4 feet long, 12 in wide, and 20-24 inches deep, with a flow of water at the bottom  We always talk about those noises and never ever gave bigfoot a chance of being the sorce of the sounds and now I just don't know His arms and hands hung down palms to the back I was always very skeptical of bigfoot but after this experience, I am convinced The easy going swing of the arms was so natural, so at home cruising with ease across boulders and rocks  I had an opportunity to unzip the tent and grab the flashlight when it paused at the picnic table, but the heavy footsteps,the pitch dark, 3year old daughter whom I was thinking about how to protect if necessary, made me pause with fear It was early spring and he was just below the summit when he saw what appeared to be a long haired ""hippie with a backpack"" trucking through the tall brush up ahead on the west side of the HWY My friend turned towards me and began sprinting back towards the road, past me, yelling “run”, with his eyes wide open  Based on the head and shoulders that I saw after it crossed the median and stood up, I'm going to guess it was about 8 feet tall. i heard more noise and from the right came another one which was alot bigger, it leaned down by the other one and  it stood up and looked right at me.it was much bigger probably 3 ft taller than the other one , it had alot of hair on its shoulders, hanging down and thick, its face was not that covered and through the binocs i sould see its eyes which were big dark , kinda human like though and a human type nose with large nostrials a mouth that was straight across and i saw its teeth when it opened it mouth they were big and flat not pointed.I could hear it breathing from where i was at But I did see the gravel it must’ve kicked up by coming to such a fast halt land near my feet and felt it bonce off my shoes and lower legs as I was turning around I was watching finding bigfoot one evening and I heard Bobo talking about squatch's speaking gibberish and it immediately made me think of that incident I could see its palms as it swung its arms and noticed it had either no or very little hair in the palm area After I got home I was thinking about it and I thought maybe it was a bear slamming a smaller tree onto a fallen log but bigfoot just stuck in my head for some reason I knew it wasnt a bear, it was just to weird, then about a month later on the news there was a bigfoot expert on and he described what I heard exactly On August 24, I had finished picking berries for the day and had returned to Scenic to a little, mostly forgotten camping spot just inside the edge of a dark old-growth forest  I would say it was approximately 8' tall We went back to the clearing and sat there until it was dark They both seemed to be very dark brown Ever since this day I have always known that it was a bigfoot that I saw that day From about fifty yards away I spotted a hairy man-like creature standing in a field next to the road We returned the next night, and brought four other people with us, and within a few minute of darkness, it would get very quiet, and then the rock throwing would start I am a true believer in Sasquatch, and read Bigfoot stories all the time(ask my wife) It stood 7+ feet tall, long arms, covered in what seemed to be dark hair and walked like a human as it paced I'd like to add that there was intelligence in the eyes and some sort of non verbal communication. The river bank is quite steep, and it's an almost sheer 25 foot or so drop to the water, with no easy footing when the tide is in and the river is up I watched it for a few seconds then yelled to Joe ""I see it!"", I think I said ""I think it's a bigfoot!"" My hair had never stood so strait on end as at that moment and I was morbidly fascinated with the last several minutes, maybe 7 or 8 minutes all together  He observed a large bipedal animal (approx I WAS ABOUT 50-100 YARDS WEST [North] OF THE FIGURE AND SAW SOMETHING LARGE AND DARK IN COLOR STANDING NEXT TO A TREE, UP ON A 15 FOOT HILL  After a period with no kayakers, about 30 mins, I watched what I can only describe as a Sasquatch or Bigfoot walk out of the woods about 80 yards away on the opposite side of the river and cross the river It was as dark as the inside of a Buffalo on a moon-less night Next day a large 16-17"" footprint was found later  as my mind was processing what i saw i  knew it had to be  arms and legs going up and down as it crossed the road and also it was actually crawling....then stood up by the bank but it was so fast it like popped up.....still hard for me to believe what i saw but i believe it was a Sasquatch...i also now believe as i approached it when my headlights came upon it...it turned back towards the headlights and scrunched its face because the headlights were in its eyes.  At no time did we every think it was bigfoot but we couldn't figure out what would make a sound like that?  It didn't sound like an animal that was mearly passing by, it moved to quick and to speratic(as if someone was throwing at different targets  When the witnesses shined the laser light on the creatures, the eyes seemed to bob and weave trying to duck away from the laser light He told me son I think you heard a bigfoot I have always been a believer, My grandfather researched and searched for bigfoot and before he died gave me his plaster cast from California  The hair sticks way up and makes him look like he has a pointy head but really the shape of the head is human  It was not until a recent conversation with a person who knows a little about Big Foot traces, that it occurred to me that I might have seen the results of a Big Foot We compared the fir tree with my son T to get an idea of how tall it was, my son is 6ft and the creature was at least 8.5 we took pictures then followed the grass trail it left behind (We could see where it went across the field in bent grass) and into the second field and stopped at the edge of the third and noticed that ahead of us the birds flew out of the trees making alot of noise Two boys came home to their mother and were crying because their feet were cold and wet from walking barefoot in snow Travis was located 50 feet below me behind a large bush when I heard a loud splash from his direction  The sound is hard to discribe but what ever it was grunted twice and then let loose with a low blood curdling scream and then beat on its chest about six times, and then it was totally quiet I calmly stated it was ""just a bigfoot, but he's gone now"" It appeared to be approximately 7-8 feet tall and very dark from head to toe Back here where it came, turned originally in the opening - there was water even then, probably it's a low spot kinda where it came through probably a foot deep or two feet deep from the rains As I slowed down, the animal which was standing on two legs steped over the guard rail and turned to start walking up the hill He noticed the smell right away, a lifted up wash tub protecting their frozen food and saw large man-like footprints on and near the open porch When we were on our way home after the camp out we stopped at the Eagles Cliff store and my wife mentioned what we heard to the girl working there and she said there had been other people that had heard it too and some mentioned having rocks thrown at them out of the dark As Nick scrambles to get up, a branch snaps and the sasquatch turns to look at him ""with big eyes""  He had a large rounded head shape, long arms that reached well below his waist line We didn't know about bigfoot or sasquatches in those days, they had not been popularized yet  At least 8 feet tall as it towered next to the sign By this time I was completely on my feet I took a wrong turn and had to head back to the camp turn off when I saw a large, black, hairy biped just at the range of my truck's highbeams The animal appeared to be about 8-8.5 feet tall and slender build Just then, my brother-in-law said ""Let's get walking people!"" Just after he said that we heard the most hair raising howl off to our right It immediately walked away on two legs It was definitely bare foot prints coming down the side of the road then turning up into the woods It got dark long before we got to the lake Her husband claimed there was blood everywhere and the Bigfoot had a large cut on it's back and it was bleeding. After pausing while the hairs on the back of our necks stood up, I said, ""You know what the F--K THAT was don't you?"" We didn't hear any further screams that night I was at the edge of the woods and started heading back towards the house when I heard something very large running in the woods about 20 feet away  He swung his arms opposite of the feet he was moving I thought for the fun of it I would take the boys (4 of them) ages 11, 13, 15 and 18 out to a dark and scary place to have fun and do some so called ""knocks"" and ""squatch"" calls.. This creature took very wide strides and crossed the road quickly although he did not appear to be in a hurry About 300 feet above the timber line I discovered tracks leading away from mine going on around the mountian  The hairs are about an inch and a half in length Found a campsite next to a swamp, and as it was getting late and almost dark, we decided to camp I could tell from the footfalls it was coming at a angle from right to left down the hill, fast! There was dirt and small rocks being pushed aside by the footfalls and the loose rocks were rolling from under its feet  So here I am now writing to you, the only people I have told this story to other than my dad, about the 6.5' to 7' tall, dark reddish brown fur covered, bipedal, short headed, ape faced, no necked, long armed, NOT A BEAR!,  sneaky creature that I saw at Lake Chopaka on 23rd, May 1996 at or around noon and again around an hour later. It  was a sound I could only classify as a big foot I've got to say I never really believed in Bigfoot, but I do now. It was almost dark so i looked over around but couldn`t see anything, so i thought maybe a deer or something It's hands and feet were big also By this time I had started slowly stepping backwards towards the Suburban, I did not take my eyes of the spot The next day I did go out and look for footprints around our cabin and found a huge print behind our cabin but it was an older print this camp site is about 15-20 miles away from where i found the footprints in the snow earlier this year report #23493. As the creature came into focus, I noticed it was about 4’ tall, standing perfectly upright, long arms, long legs, very thin with long brown hair covering his entire body & face It was very muscular, and very hairy except for I did not see hair on the face and on the fingers I’ve lived in WA my whole life and had in interest in crypto-zoology as a child but had never taken any mention of Bigfoot seriously until I had my encounter She said they were almost to the end of my street when a large animal with long reddish brown hair crossed the road in front of them and took one easy step over my neighbors barbed wire fence (mom clarified it was a metal gate) and kept going EACH NIGHT OF THE GROWLS IT WAS ABOUT 7 PM AND DARK. Deer hunting, south 101 out of Aberdeen, mile post 69, turn left on m-line -- logging road, turn left onto m-2800 stay left, #4 were I found a 20ft tree upside down stuck into the ground, about three feet in-- root side up.. They had never heard of big foot prior to this incidence and thought they were having contact with a giant of some sort After walking about 17 feet up the trail we heard another knock in the same place Someone made some comment about a big foot but neither I or anyone else believed in that I never saw big foot until one day when my son and I went to Tule Lake to do some fishing We finally could take no more, and on the count of three, got up and ran in the dark all the way back (three miles) to the road, where we slept against a tree  I took my nephew over to look at it and my golden girl followed us, we were looking at the footprint, when she decided to lay right down next to it (for a tummy rub) and wiped it out with her tail!!!  Oh man, that was horrible to see!  I knew they were there, but now I have my own proof! On my right hand side (east side of freeway) was just dark forest for as far as I could see Because I had seen the track (about five miles from the tree stand) and because I happended to have been reading a book on Bigfoot encounters, I was not at all frightened by the encounter and decided to descend from my perch in order to have a better view beneath the canopy of the surrounding trees Around 2am, I heard loud pronounced footfalls to my front and right  They were small ponds average size probably 20 by 30 feet In the process of searching the area, he found a 14-inch human looking track (left foot) close to the front porch When I stopped and turned around to see this ‘bear’ it stoodup on it's hind legs and looked right at me  Nad my wife and I were definitely not looking for bigfoot when we both saw him Perhaps the Bigfoot picked up the items from a backyard or killed the coyote To this day she still remembers what she saw and believes it was a bigfoot  They were scuffs of tracks from the animal dragging its feet, not the clear, easily identifiable tracks you see on TV, etc...The crab apple tree had a signifigent section of broken branches, and two pieces of apple laying on the ground. Now, that part just south of Bellingham on the I5 freeway, is a hilly wooded area for about 5 miles, surrounded by farms on the south and Bellingham on the north It started to get dark and we were walking out After recently reading ""The Hoopa Project"" and the many incidences recounted with ground shaking foot falls, I say, put me down for a class ""B"" incident that was too close for comfort.. I could make out something very big on two feet standing in the shadows of the trees But they were definitely not bears - too tall and far too graceful When Mark tried to duplicate this same stride length, he fell because the slope was 45 degrees It was just getting dark so we had the headlights on and the dome light lit up everything around us, so we couldn't see a few feet (10+ or so from the truck) As I said, at least 7.5 ft or taller, based on the fact that I could see its head at or above the trees on the riverbank that it went though At the far end of the windbreak, about 10 or 15 feet from my feet it squatted down and started going through my pack 10/23/04: Diana after returning home from a football game at around 2130 the night before placed two large pumpkins weighing about 15 pounds apiece next to the house under the eve  Bloody scraped legs and wet clothes from sliding down the small water-filled rock beds, we got to our car and cried Two problems one I didn't get my digital camera until may and all I had to compare the size to was my size 13 foot Now days I've been better educated about Bigfoot from watching shows on TV and I'm very sure that is what we saw that night It wasn't dark brown We continued back to camp and told my grandfather that i think we just got chased by a bigfoot and his response was ""are you smoking dope there is no such thing as big foot "" It was maybe 5 or 6 feet away from my car The surrounding woods and property consisted of Alders, Evergreens, local trees and lots of underbrush, berry brambles and a barbed wire fence which was 4 or 5 feet tall, 3 strands It was a clear, sunny day, no clouds and no wind I looked up photos of Bigfoot tracks and one of mine looked very similar to the track photographed in the Hoh Rainforest in 2005 We agreed, and met him at a designated place, and proceeded to go to Bear Creek where we had seen the footprints Rainier, I witnessed a 10 foot bigfoot cross the highway and enter a stand of douglas fir At Forest Service Road 46, right next to #1270, I saw a reddish-brown bear-human like animal (6') stand up in the middle of road and run away (lumber away) on 2 legs  I tried to look for prints in the mourning but the underbrush was so thick I could hardly move around, the brush was up to my waist everywhere and up to my chest in places and im 6 foot Not human? Who runs around on a river barefooted in October with temps in the near freezing? After doing a closer survey of the area we found several different sets of tracks in what looked to be 3 or 4 different sizes with the largest being about 17” It was definetly a Big Foot I ended up crossing halfway into the other lane but I would estimate its distance to the side of my car as I began to pass would have been 3/4 feet at the closest It was a year or so ago that I came across some bigfoot sites, and I played some of the recorded .wav files I only got a glimpse maybe 5 seconds but it was only about 20 feet away at the last part and didn't seem to have even seen me as it went into the larger trees It was facing the road then it spun around counter clockwise and in less than 3 steps was gone back into the timber with its arms swinging as it stepped My friend was in front and I was about 20 feet behind him chopping what he had missed But all I could hear was its breathing and the intense sensation that we were making eye contact; that this thing and I were holding each other with our eyes for several minutes It had a dark brown face visable through it's hair I WOULD SAY IT WAS PROBALY 6 FEET TALL WITH A SLIM BUT A MUSCULAR BUILD It didn't appear to have a nose, eyes, mouth or anything, that we could see from the 100 yards we were away What I did see was a pair of big yellow eyes, looking back at me I had heard of the foul odor associated with bigfoots and immediatley became uncomfortable It was very much like the latter half of a roaring scream that I have heard played on various bigfoot documentaries While walking along the Mill Creek Constitutional Path on 12/15/2000 witness Harley Michaelis observed large barefooted tracks along the trail  Something would have to have a lot of strength to pull down and snap and have to be quite tall to grab as well It was about 9pm in the evening and we were scanning the clear cut with our flashlights when we first saw the eyeshine in the distance approximately 150 to 200yards 100 feet across, the other side very steep, devils club, etc, going up into wilderness of the O.N.P Just in front of our cabin was a 30 to 40 foot fir tree tipped over and the root ball was up in the air with a hole in the ground about eight feet Then the eyes dropped down a little and made a big circle  I never bothered to look for footprints    And the shape of its head and shoulders looked just like what I’ve seen from Bigfoot imagery over the years, exactly the same  The hair on my body stood straight up, I felt chilled and distinctly “warned off” It was about 3 to 3.5 feet high, made of pine needles and was shaped sort of like a volcano with a hole at the top all the time we lived there you wood hear shrill whistling whistling in the bushes at this time we were maybe ten years old never heard of bigfoot before im 48 years old now so it was long ago.It was in the ninteen sixtys way before roger patterson nobody knew about bigfoot  Rob told me on the drive out of there that he saw something cross the road while we heard the footsteps  He didn't hear anything or get out of the car to check for footprints The arms were long and hung at the animal's side I took photographs of the foot prints with a water bottle and my foot for reference I said to my friend that I wanted to let her in the tent, but he said ""No, it's probably only a deer."" As soon as I spoke we could hear heavy  ""2-footed"" footsteps running away When they saw the footprint they instantly accused us of trying to play a trick on them I don't know what it was, probably nothing, I do believe bigfoot is real however it never crossed my mind till my son told us that it was  not a bear it was Bigfoot I tried to see into the tree line but it was too dark  Maybe someone can help me eliminate bigfoot from the possible list. Sometime later, I heard a scream in a documentary about bigfoot that was almost identical to what I heard that night  On the left side of the tent (facing the door) between the tree and the tent were 2 footprints - one print was sunk at least an inch into the pine mulch It has a wide and stumpy nose, the hairiness under the nose getting thicker, hiding the jaw line It looked at us, crouched down and tried to hide behind the small shrub and then took off to the left with huge strides up the slope and out of sight As we walked, we came to the water tower where silver tooth saw the ten foot men, and there were large foot prints all around the water tower It was a dark color, I couldn't make out any facial features or see how long the arms were The four of us drove our two minivans through the Dark Divide and arrived at camp late in the day on the 14th Large long finger like foot with a open toes spread I was thinking the whole time I was throwing the hair into our garbage that I should maybe keep it but decided against it because I figured that no one would believe me anyways, my lab mix's hair was very similar in color, DNA testing was announced on the news only months later, can you imagine how mad I was that I didn't keep it It looked like it had very long arms; almost reaching it's knees  It might be a BigFoot residence  I found some interesting things traveling around the area this trip:  · A skid mark, looking very much like a human buttock on a road side bank, complete with what might have been hand prints and three impressions that hinted at being bare footprints – 16.5” long x 6” wide at the ball and with toes At first I saw [only one] footprint but looked again, it was big and other than the ones we left it was the only one We were standing at the river bank, basically just enjoying the sunset, when my sister said, "" Holy S***t, it's bigfoot!"", and pointed to the far bank It looked like the (thing) had been walking on it's hind feet the whole time and had stayed just below the timber line until it found my tracks it kept happening for like 5 minutes then it just stoped with like 3 ""chirps"" there is a site i went 2 that night oregonbigfoot.com I thought it was weird for someone to be out in the snow in their bare feet It was pitch dark on a moonless night near the Elwah River All he would say over and over was ""that was huge, the eyes, huge..""  We all wanted to get the hell out of the woods my wife awoke to our pet rabbit scrambling around in the driver's footwell Rodregies said the creature just stopped what ever it was doing and turned quickly and looked at him with eyes of fire Looking back now, It seems even more strange that if the foot print was in fact a person that had taken off their shoes to fix their socks or whatever, why would they walk up the trail, especially in late October? after the noise stopped and about an hour went by we had heard loud rusttling sounds in the bushes on the upper part of the hill on the other side of the road and very loud footfalls and we also heard something very large splashing in the river which was i would say 30 feet from our jeep When out of the small trees it came and in maybe four strides it had made it across the 15-20 yards and across the dirt road into the bigger trees It looked to be about 5-6 ft tall and was upright on two legs with hair the color of a grizzly and of the same kind as an ape but in longer strands It was covered in hair, kind of scruffy looking and once in awhile it would turn its body and there was a green tint to it  He cleared the roadway in 2 strides, and moved into the brush on the bayside of the road  I looked up the hillside 20 feet up and 40 to 50 yards away where I saw a creature 8 feet tall walking upright at a angle going up the hillside There were remnants of a campfire here, as well as a 4-foot wall or blind made of stacked rock around the entrance  At least the ten-foot tree trunk would still be there I could see the nose and lips (very humanlike) but not the eyes I know what I saw was a Bigfoot. The open areas are about sixty to eighty yards wide cleared from side to side, About 100-150 or so yards ahead of us on the next ridge (the power towers were on ridge top to ridge top) we seen a bipedal figure come out of the tree line and just stand there frozen and stare out at the clearing not moving at all for what seemed to be three to four minutes  Then a couple more joined in, with one sounding to be a good couple-hundred yards in the woods, and a couple hundred feet up the slope, but it was still plenty loud What was it doing? All of a sudden it took off and graciously walked across the clearing of this hill top and to the other side very quickly with long strides and then lost into the other sides tree line It was about 4pm and as I was turning a corner, I saw a large hairy biped creature cross in front of me and go up the bank to my right  I have been attacked by a 12 foot shark while scuba diving We went back to playing and a bit later one of my friends, the only boy, exclaimed “Did you guys see that?  There was a tall black thing on two legs that just jumped across the creek.”  We all looked out into the field, but did not see anything Dad and his best friend, a Nooksack tribal member, determined it was not a mountain lion and on two occasions went out in an attempt to find a track or hair or blood I think it was only around 7 feet tall, it didn't seem that much bigger than my stepdad and brothers who are 6'2""-6'4"" Two sets of foot prints are found, 12"" long and 6"" long, whereupon Brenda puts a roast chicken into a high tree fork, since she wants to see the ""baby"" The last incident that ive had with a ""bigfoot"" which im not the only one who saw this, but we were out doing a bradley gunner at a range on base, and a bradley IFV has very detailed thermal scopes on it for night shooting, and we all saw what appeared to be  a very large person running at the very far edge of the range which is almost 2 miles away, i saw it, and 3 other people in three other vehicles saw the same thing, so we asked range control if anyone was down there were we were shooting and they said there shouldnt be and sent someone down to check it out but there was nothing to be found. This “thing” would have towered over me! The creature was either dark brown or black, as I could not make out any body or head features at all Every hair on my body stood on end as I made my way immediately back to the top of the bluff  I stood beside the good print and attempted to make a footprint in the pine mulch to see if I could get it an inch deep I was so scared that I do not remember how tall it was, only that I have the impression of a very tall creature My foot is a 11 regular but the track was about 2"" wider and maybe 3"" longer tall, it had broad shoulders and a thick neck, but the head seemed small compared to its body size Granted it was dark, but with the moon out and lack of cloud cover I could make out a black shape 7' or 8' tall striding through the underbrush At dusk I heard a long ""howling"" call from far below me that literally caused my hair stand on end  It was dark, foggy and kind of misty I immediately thought that it looked like a bigfoot standing there They then turned around because it was getting dark Not to mention this figure I witnessed was tall, I couldnt put a number on it  My tent was a 5 foot high dome tent and whatever it was crinkled the tarp near the top The area has a lot of little bushes which resemble a miniature huckleberry, the plant no taller than 6"" high  After I boxed the prints, I checked for any prints or hair on the sides of the vehicle   He further stated that bears seen in profile tend to have a rather horizontal back, while the animal he saw had a steeply slanted back due to the arms being a lot longer than the legs It took only 3 strides for it to cross the road I was able to days later calm her down and she told me about it.She said it reminded her of Big Foot from That harry and the henderson movie He just kept saying that he just witnessed Bigfoot and to stay inside for fear it was going to get us It was late May or early June (2001) so it had just gotten dark I didn't say anything at the time, I wasn't frightned, just totally amazed by what I just saw I photographed both tracks and made a plaster cast of the left foot As we hung more interduct, I noticed a large hairy animal which crossed the road When I say it was pushing ten feet tall, I feel confident that this is an accurate judgment of its true height A distinct trail could be found leading from the top of a small hill, down hill through 8 foot high Salmonberries, Devils club, Blackberries and other intertwined plants It was at this time full dark and I could not see more than a few feet into the darkness  When my eyes moved down to the lower part of the trees, just uphill from our parking spot, I saw a head and shoulder-like shape standing between two trees On the way to the area of the noise I noticed a tall dark tree trunk in the bushes, but keept going to the area that we thought the noise came from The reason we noticed the track initially was not because it was so large (which we discovered on closer inspection) it was because there was patchy snow on the ground, it was raining, quit chilly, and here someone had be out in the middle of nowhere walking around bare footed I didn't think of looking for any kind of footprints or anything, so this isn't really much of a ""report"" TIME TO LEAVE!..........I immediately ran to my left, down hill and through the woods for about 200 feet then back up on the path It was about 20 feet away Getting dark we decided we did not want to meet what ever it was in the dark and crossed the road and got into the truck, we had to drive right by where we had heard the sounds, we never saw any bushs being trashed, only heard them I stopped the car and was mounting  a lens on my camera ; my brothers got out of the car to strech their legs and scan the hills ; my uncle was in the back seat of the car with a spotting scope looking down into meadow to the northeast Inititally trying to be quiet, I felt it best to make all the noise I could Hi, i recently heard a show called coast to coast am during my graveyard shift and decicded maybe its time to tell someone about my sighting years ago while i was hunting,  I grew up in Skamania county washington, thats in the lower cenrtal part of the state, I spent my youth hiking and exploring the woods with my father, i  had heard of bigfoot sightings growing up and remember a story in the skamania county pionner news paper about a deputy shiriff seeing one and them getting a  cast of its foot{might want to look that story up) anyway i didnt believe at all in them cause i had covered alot of dense forest land and never saw anything or heard anything,  my father told me he found a footprint when he was in his twentys  hunting, it was in a patch of snow he said it was kinda old but he said it wasnt anything like hed ever  seen, it was about 18 inches long by maybe 7 to 8 inches wide with toes and a deep impression i still didnt beleive in them,  And like most people some of the crazy stories about ufos and bigfoot in them and and some of the charactors that tell the stories make it easy to make fun of it  We hiked up a well-traveled trail--possibly the Spruce Trail--and came upon a footprint of which I still have a picture The house is on the Ocean side so critters and brush moving is normal but this night was different, it was very dark and too quiet, not even a frog croaking As I approached the camp just before dark I smelled a musty smell like a pack rats den but stronger one of the other leaders commented yeah there is definately a skunk around  It is hard to explain the smell except that with what I had learned in my investigation it made the hair on the back of my neck, no! the hair on my complete body stand on end  Inside they found hair, which looks like elk hair, and a full hand print  It appeared to be about six to seven feet tall Even though I never doubted the existence of Bigfoot, I always considered myself a ""Professional Skeptic"" We didn't find any foot prints, but there was a lingering odor...like animal dung but more powerful Had hiked about 1000 feet when I spotted what appeared to be deer tracks heading over the road and down into the ravine, took a few photos and went down into the ravine The eyes were a golden brown color The next morning 10/24/04 when leaving for work she found one of the pumpkins had been moved and seemingly placed next to the rear tire of the van which was 25 feet from the pumpkins  I've never heard of bigfoot tracks on hiking trails, which was another reason I dismissed the track In the spring of 1981 me and my family were camping up the Lewis river.We were out on a bush wack hike{not on a trail} we came across a large foot print on the edge of a creek.We keep it to our selves for all these years until I heard about your web site.I also was hunting out side Packwood Wa in oct 1999 and heard an incredible sound I have never heard before,It was so loud and the woods went silent when it was done. Multiple footprints, about 14 inches long and about 1/4 inch deep in firm ground was able to track the prints for only 15 feet before losing trail. But as I looked again it's whole body was covered in shaggy auburn hair  Even though I know it could not see inside the car, It felt like my eyes were locked on its as we drove by  I have no idea what it was other than to say it walked on two legs, was covered in brown hair  The eyes were green  At the end of the trail, there was a circular clearing about 150 feet in diameter This is where we saw three distinct tracks, one in the sand then two deeper ones about 80 inches apart with the last easily defined print on the other side of an log that I could tell, didn't even break it's stride for  The lake was between my campsite and where bigfoot stood on Saturday night their were six of us around the camp fire and heard the same roar as from Saturday morning, I told everybody that vocalization is from bigfoot, so we stayed up for a while longer and went to sleep in our tents at about 10:30pm Dan knew he had seen something very unusual and he was aware of Big Foot sightings in the news It then dawned on all of us how big these footprints were....and the stride was enormous Even if i used my phone, I was shaking with fear, for myself and my friends who were feet away in tents It was obvious that the subject was predominantly bipedal by its build, though its movements on the ground just prior appeared agile, fluid and effortless We went to the camp and set up even in the darkness I didn't know what it was and we went past a few trees and I ask the boy “WHAT IN THE HELL IS THAT?” He couldn't see it, and I drove ahead about another five feet  Today as I was pulling my train out of the siding  I saw an odd foot print and thought  some one slipped and that's just a big hand  The animal's arms moved in a pedulum manner, like an ape - not like a human I didn't like the feeling I was getting, so I quicky mended the fence and finshed checking the fence line on the N side, then turned back to the E, and came down to a small creek and noticed these huge footprints in the still wet mud I did not check for body odors, hairs, or anything like that. 7 to 7 1/2 feet tall with very broad shoulders, fully covered in hair, a bit lighter brown on top and got darker as it went down, almost to a black as it got to mid chest (I was facing toward the rear of the train.)  About a mile west of the tunnel exit, I suddenly glimpsed a ‘huge’ figure, standing in the trees, up the grade about 50 to 75 feet from the train!! The woods were quite dense and I only saw the figure for a brief moment but it was unmistakably a Bigfoot!! He, (it) was standing on the sharp incline, looking down at the train, with his right hand on an Aspen tree!! (Because of the speed of the train, I only glimpsed it but I’m positive of what I saw!!!!)  The area seemed to be very remote, desolate and wild!! A minute or two later, the landscape dropped off into a steep canyon where I could view the Skokomish river below The place where he saw Bigfoot was not too far ahead Just those yellow eyes thier was some hair on a bush about 6 inches long not much an  thier was a few footprints around  i have a size 11 shoe and i put my foot in the biggest one i could find and it was probably 3 inches wider and  5 inches longer that my boot so like maybe 17 inches long and 7 inches wide, thier where some huge 3 foot rocks rolled over and you could see they dug under them, or something had and a couple old rotten logs moved and broke up However, all I heard were those footfalls continue to my left and away It was just one knock but 30 feet or so further away this time ""like the one in the movie taken in California, but not as filled out."" He called to the other family members to come and see this animal and the creature turned around, looked at them with a ""disgusted"" ape face, took very long strides up the hill to the ridge and with it's left hand, grabbed a 20 foot Fir tree and shook it violently a couple of times, then went down the other side of the ridge The Tallik's have lived here since 1965. It sounded like heavy footsteps either walking or maybe running by our camp site As I approached the spot where I saw what looked like eyes.. Can someone tell me I have a 13 foot and stand at 6'  Very definately a two footed descent I bent it back and noticed some hair hanging from the license plate bolt While busting through the brush I encountered something that was very big and shaped like you would think bigfoot would be shaped but only saw it in the dark with no lights except for the moon  It looked like the bigfoot from the patterson-gimlin film honestly  Then appreciating it was between 7.5 to 8' tall, and seeing that huge stride, I hollered to the guys and started running after it It was probably 8' or 8 1/2' tall Bigfoot sighting 12/27 at 12:30 a.m on I-5 during the winter storm Second Encounter – Eyes in the clear cut When he looks back at the sasquatch, it is already walking with long strides across the brush and wildflower covered meadow, ""lifting up his feet more than people do"" I guess that’s when I started believing that maybe Bigfoot was real! Being very knowledgeable of the river and the fish runs, I came to the conclusion that combined with the fact that for the last few years the woods had been closed to public entry 90% of the season and that the summer-run steelhead where being let go out of the lower hatchery and almost all of them stopping at Beginner's Hole because that’s where they had been released that maybe it had come down from up river looking for food and quite possibly had found a steelhead paradise I could then hear footsteps coming down the side of the hill toward us in the lot She was confident I had seen one of their ""teenagers""  They're tall and skinny just like ours she said we heard them get out of their vehicle and started talking so i got out and went to them and asked if everything was okay, and their response to my question was that some massive hairy thing ran across the road right infront of them which they almost hit To liven things up a bit, and perhaps scare a few people, he and I had decided that I would sneak to the field on foot, unbeknownst to our classmates, and give a few blows on the call, which mimics a dying rabbit, while he would tell ""sasquatch"" stories It moved in a quick loping fashion with it's arms extended downward and swinging at it's side I judged it to be about 8 feet tall, and it was definitely of a humanlike body shape My brother and I got out to look at the tracks and could not believe our eyes  It crossed the road a few hundred feet in front of my pick-up  I hope than one day I will see [a] bigfoot again. I notice the sky is still dark, full of stars and the moon positioned in the south western part of the sky right above the mountaintops As my feet stopped I could hear footsteps in the dry gravel on the other side of the creek bed about 20' away It was at an area on the beach that I saw it's feet turn towards the incoming waves One was about a foot and a half taller than the other, both dark in color with very wide shoulders The animal leaned forward head going low, could see top of both black haired ears What we saw we thought was a big foot and we shouted out several warnings to whoever or whatever was there that we were going to begin shooting She said it walked on two legs, and she got the impression it was walking hunched over, and that it had no neck, and massive shoulders, that the body seemed almost impossibly bulky I had become aware of bigfoot in the Northwest during 2018 and started paying more attention to some odd things I would see It was just inside of the tree line, about 10 feet away from us  I kept my eyes fixed on it, but turned my head to make it look like I wasn’t watching it A few of us CA-BFRO members were invited and held the furthest base camp from the main camp & shared that particular site with various WA bigfooters As we watched, the form began to vigorously wave its unusually long arms up and down and over its head The huge mass stopped whatever it was doing, turned, & in one SMOOTH MOTION, turned at the waist ,& stood up right to about 8 plus feet tall If I didn’t see it with my own eyes I would be a skeptic too I guess. The tree was only about 12 feet or so tall and Christmas tree shaped, but fairly sparse branches She said the most astounding thing she remembered about her experience was the human look in it's eyes Between the moon and what was left of the fire I could see what some years later people were calling Bigfoot  It was not scruffy or dull colored hair but appeared to be healthy especially the way the thing moved. We were doing a follow up investigation of the area after hearing of a sighting of bigfoot  They were so astonished, and afraid, they ran home, but our daughter said ""But I knew it wasn't a bear, he had such kind eyes"" To my chagrin, looking back from where I came, the guitar playing had stopped and I could here a variety of scattering voices from my party and movement, including two people with headlamps on totally oblivious to what was happening, while walking up the small berm and into the line of sight between where I stood opposed to the subject during the encounter The knocks did not sound like an axe striking a wood or tree (sounding like a (chis-whop) the sounds I heard were definitly four to five foot lengths and dry enough to leave the impression of the loud sounds heard that SEEMED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 100-150 yards off to my right  So we went back to the spot and it was very dark by now The hair on its head was also black and looked very much like shorter dreadlocks It tripped while looking over its shoulder, I could see the eyes go down then slowly get up again all the while watching me and walked off into the swamp looking over its shoulder It was a left foot The track that had exposed the wet ground was less than 10 minutes old when we found it, since it dried before our eyes to form a dry crust  I HAVE TO SAY, AT THAT TIME, I NEVER HEARD ANY THING ABOUT A ""BIG FOOT"" UNTIL 1973, BUT STILL REMEMBERED THE STRANGE knocks heard back then I found a few recordings and immediately the hair on our arms and neck stood straight up My first thought it was a bigfoot howl or yell, as it seemed so distant but so filling of the entire forest/valley He then he stepped up this side hill and on the other side Rodregies said he saw a bear, black in colour laying over a vinemaple and not moving."" So he moved slowly closer when just in front of him about 50 feet away was this very large thing standing up  Perhaps the fur or hair was wet and matted down from the rain Hutchinson retained the cast of the left foot I had never heard of Big Foot so could only think it was a huge bear There were only two footprints of any real detail in the rocky sand What I could see was a dark figure from about mid-torso up because the beach slopes down quite a bit in that area I found two unknown animal footprints, one I stepped on and destroyed, the other an obvious right foot It was obviously used because the brush underfoot was consistently stamped flat, but in all my time living in that area the only people I ever saw on it were myself and any friends who might’ve taken the trip with me (maps.google.com, type in 50th Ave and 228th St SE) Having spent that night, like many before and after, relaxing on my friends patio with several other regulars, I got up, put out my cigarette, said my goodbyes and left id say the big one was maybe 7 or 8 ft tall not any taller than 8 and maybe 400 to 500 pounds, not like the storys id heard of 13 ft tall and 1000 pounds they got to to top of the hill and another one came up from the right it was a little shorter than the big one and kinda hard to see, it was probably thier in view i just didnt see it earlier as i was looking at the others they  walked out of sight over the hill into the canyon i just sat thier and was questioning myself what i had just saw, i was scared but just totally amazed , ileft the area and went home , i wished i had a camera so bad but ill always have the vision in my head ""It"" was on its knees, head straight, facing toward a nine-o-clock position from my point of view, slightly down, back straight with clear space in between front torso and ground and violently swinging back what appeared to be both arms in a stroke-like motion  I distinctly remember not wanting to see anything that could throw a 300 pound rock over 30 feet The campfire is located about 20 feet from the edge of a creek running through a sapling filled older riverbed The trailhead was filled with cars, although most of the foot traffic we encountered was on the way up as others were headed down Still no odor and nothing was really found in the darkness I grabbed my .44 magnum revolver (just in case) and a flashlight scanning the trees in hopes to see a illuminated red pair of eyes it had longer arms that than a human and ran straight armed After 3 hours it was getting dark, but i was very determined that day My husband (6'1"" tall) tried to match the stride, and was short of making it by nearly 2 feet --Although you can't interpret actual hair from 30-50 yards with this thermal unit, there did seem to be some hair shade (as have some other large mammals I've seen from a similar distance on certain nights) and the subject was undoubtedly void of any clothing First off I am not a true beliver in BigFoot At about five feet up I did find one broken twig It looked to covered in black hair all over it's body and was moving quickly from one group of trees across a meadow to another group of trees All the way to the campsite and for the next few days the thought of a Bigfoot throwing a rock and hitting my truck never left my mind and we continued to talk about it a lot Just as we were at the end of the bramble mounds, and emerging into a clearing area, to my right, from the river bank, there arose a hair-raising screeching howly yowling sound, like something terrified and screaming The feet were 18"" long He then put his foot in one of the tracks for comparison We were driving south on Highway 231 and as we approached Sanctuary Way (47.9763678, -117.7323568) just off the highway in the ditch I noticed a very large black ""thing"" in the tall yellow, uncut grass I hit the gas at that point because I was turning left and had to go right past this animal within about 10 to 15 feet of it Instinctively, I started to cover the distance to my shed about 35 feet and while I was on my way, I could feel/hear the ground pounding as ""whatever"" was moving for cover in the brush to the south  My tent was pitched between two old growth trees with approximately 4 feet of space on either side We were laughing and joking when suddenly we heard a growl that instantly stood the hairs on our neck up in a frenzy  I have hunted and fished my whole life and never have heard or seen the trees bend right next to me as something walked with two legs right next to me , yet unseen I new one of the guys, he's a logger up there, and he stopped to warn us of the Divide Ridge after dark deal I believe 100% in bigfoot Looking back and wondering what it might have been, I was looking on Youtube watching various bigfoot documentaries when one showed a clip of a white creature very much similar to the one I had encounted many years ago Every hair on my body was standing up So we hike up the hill side to where the noise is coming from and where the pond is, and we discovered a foot print while the whole time still hearing this noise, ooh ooh ooh, short and sharp but monkey like As a result, the lower foot had slipped about 8 inches down the slope, tearing the slope to the wet clay beneath As we drove, I began noticing these big wooden cutout siloutes of what looked like to me was a Bigfoot  About 30 feet behind me quantities of tall dead grass filled the bank, and I remember not wanting to look to closely It was very dark, and seemed quite isolated, but other than that, it felt normal, no sense of impending doom, no unseen presence felt  The size of it must have been eight feet tall or taller as the guard rail was of little difficulty for the animal to step over The nearest Fir tree was 75 feet from me They observed a tall animal, standing erect, observing them About 6 or so months later we were astonished to hear of Bigfoot searchers with helicopters based at the dam It was huge and dark We stood there for quite a while discussing this strange find, and came to no conclusion until the other fellow with us said ""May be Bigfoot did it"" At first, I think that it is a large man wearing dark, winter clothing Once there he said, ""you have to ranch with them, and live with them, they mean no harm, just leave when they ask and come back and finish your work"", at that time we both heard a uuggh ugghh (loud, like someone yelling), the tree to the right of the fence line moved a lot, 20 foot tree bent or swayed nearly 75 degrees, then crashing through the woods, you could actually see where an animal was moving, a large animal, these trees and the brush on Bills Hill at the time were very close, and the brush was very dense, I challenge anyone to copy that About a 100 yards or so from the camper, I heard some very heavy footsteps This lake is probably the size of a football field That evening I hunted another area to let my disturbance ""wear off"" but returned the next afternoon ready to sit the stand until dark He saw my eyes and I saw his  So I KNOW this was either a bigfoot or someone dressed up like one As I stepped out of the cover of the brush to my left, about 100 yards away, underneath the branches of a fir tree and back against the trunk, I saw what looked exactly like the face of a big foot The night was moonless and so it was very dark; there were streetlights, but each of them was separated by 70-100ft or more and was only on one side of the road They were amazed that it could take such long strides up that hill, without the aide of pulling on trees What I saw was a tall black creature covered with hair and very muscular walking quickly across the clearing parallel to us towards the forest The hairs were standing on the back of my neck the rest of the drive I counted to twenty before I opened my eyes and looked and there was nothing We got about 1/4 mile from camp and noticed rustling sounds in the bushes directly across the creek from us, maybe 40-50 feet away  They were about 13-14 inches long and the stride was 4 to 5 feet apart  I have experienced rocks being thrown at my cabin, and the most scary was when I looked across the road a few nights ago and saw whitish blue bright eyes- with no lights shining on them!  Is this a Sasquatch?  It is frightening me very much It was aprox 10-12 "" long and 1.5"" wide, tubular and colored dark perpal black, close to the color of bear or cougar droppings but the dropping was almost one continuous losenge and not pinched sharply at the end, like cougar or coyote nor piled like a bear paddy I don’t think anyone would have walked out there barefoot and if they had, they had some tremendous feet This large creature then set out across the meadow toward the river with long ""keep on trucking"" strides  Anyway, that's my one and only Bigfoot sighting Refering to the bigfoot in our local beer ads As it pounded after me I heard once again the distinct sound of two individual feet contacting the ground It was a real pretty brown, long hair, and from what I could tell was over six feet tall, but not real gigantic We both concluded it was a bigfoot we just ran into Evening, starting to get dark but still light I have always had an interest in Bigfoot and I do believe they exist While driving Blacksnake Ridge doing field work I came across large bipedal footprint going across Blacksnake ridge I walked back around the opposite side of the lake back towards our camp keeping an eye out for bear as I know they would start to move around dark as it cooled down, though with the boys so noisy and it being drier at this lower elevation ( not many berries at all) I doubted there were any around Same thing with the feet area, no shoes! I will call this a ""HE"" from here on out because that's what my gut is telling me I never told anyone about it until my mother and I watched a documentary recently and I heard a recording of what was supposed to be a Bigfoot growling or mumbling Of course we all looked and sure enough, through a long, narrow opening in the trees we could see what looked to be a very large, dark stump with a somewhat rounded pointy top The creek on the North side of me by 20 feet and the large forest of fir and cedar to my south by 75 feet  As I got closer I was maybe 50-100 feet away and realized (or assumed) it was a person and I thought to myself what the hell are they doing? Crossing the highway in the middle of the night, in the middle of a freezing cold winter storm, and in the middle of nowhere… It was grey black, long hair that came down to meet masive shoulders I also knew it wasn't a bear because bears are meant to be on all fours it wouldn't have ""arms"" that came down about half way down the thigh (I could tell they came down that far because they swing slightly as it walked) On the last night the kids were having a round of ""hide & go seek "" in the dark around the main camp It was, as I mentioned, standing just inside the treeline, so the lower legs were hidden from view - only from about midthigh upwards was visible and definitely looked humanlike but with a pointier head than a normal human Five toes, proportionally wider than a human footprint I walked back slowly to the caution tape to see what I could and didn't want to see and there in the dirt was a foot print  My friends and I walked all over looking for some sign of what she said happened but since the ground was dry, there weren't any distinguishable footprints (partial legs, arms, knee & head were contrasted behind that biggest tree in view: see re-creation pic # 2) The subject then began to move its head right to left behind the tree repeatedly as if to possibly discern me or my presence more clearly We all began to run, because whatever it was, was coming right towards us, and fast! I got a sudden case of the braves, and said "" Don't run!"", then heard very definite, heavy footsteps in the brush, no more than ten feet away, and still coming after us, and said, ""Okay, maybe jog!"", and we proceeded to hightail it up to the car  The interesting thing about the impressions is that there would be a deep heel print, then an undisturbed space, then the front of the foot Helens was Bigfoot. The footfalls kept coming my way and they were making heavy slaps like someone wearing swim fins or was barefoot and had exceptionally large feet starting to cross the lot behind the truck about 40 feet or so behind our parked truck Then I realized that it was facing away from me towards the swampy brush because the stump I was looking had a muscley buttocks and I could see on the top of the stump what looked like a v shape tuft of hair similar to Howard the Duck I also hope maybe you can give me some insight? I really don’t know what I saw still, but the only thing that makes sense anymore is if it were a Bigfoot. the last foot print was in a frozen mud puddle that left a perfect imprint with five toes an arch and heel about 18 inches long 6 inches wide I returned down hill to get my wife for a witness. I was seeing its head and shoulders as it was standing at the foot of my sleeping bag Something with HUGE feet  had followed me from the  timber line part way up the mountian A Bigfoot-like creature was seen at a distance of 20 feet at midnight Big shoulders long arms and wide body all covered in brown hair But what we did see was on the west side that it had disappeared into, was covered in black berries about five feet high and an obvious path right through them up the hill side It is a long dark two lane country road that bisects a huge prairie with lots of old growth woodlands bordering it In the middle of the night, The frogs from the pond stopped croking, and this loud whistling and clicking noise started, I asked my Husband what it was, and he said he thought it was a Bigfoot  By the time it was really going it was dark out and we were just sitting and talking As my friend and I walked and talked all of a sudden there was a loud growling/screaming and about 50 feet or so in front of us the trees were shaking and what ever it was moved a tree (probably Alder) enough to let sunlight beam down, these were big trees, and it seemed like the earth was shaking a bit Numerous branches were broken from 8 feet to approx The creature looked very tall and large to me  2 trees at about 5 feet apart on either side of the trail were both twisted over at their tops It was full dark, with scattered lights from houses and pole lights in some yards The river was about 4 1/2 feet deep where it was and it seemed to me in the moonlight to be standing waist deep, slowly swinging its arms trying to get free I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up and looked to my right to notice a dark in color large animal moving away from us in a rather fast pace Yes he said he saw it move and when it's eyes moved he said he almost went bananas The animal was about three feet high in a sitting, crouched position It was far away maybe 400 yards and the Christmas trees were 5-7 feet high and at first I thought it was an elk moving at that distance  We decided to go for a quick hike just before dark They yelled, ""Look! Bigfoot!!"" At this point, the creature, stood straight up, and looked directly at us for a few quick seconds My hair was literally standing on end The only animal I saw the whole time was a bat, and that was when it was almost dark  It's hair was light in color...almost gray The toes curled into the forest floor the the big tow of the right foot breaking through the vegetation and leaving an obvious toe print in the wet dirt There is a recording of bigfoot sounds from Shaw Road in 1972 Me and her son was walking some trails and we came to a dried up creek bed, we were looking for moose tracks and we seen these foot prints It was upright on two feet and all I can really say is that it was large and brown I was a bit on edge and thought, ""let's get out of here!"" We continued the hike back to our cars and I remember thinking to myself, ""that was weird"", and what a weird night I had just experienced and why isn't my mom talking about this more?? She's the Bigfoot fanatic in our family! Didn't she think that was strange? Maybe she was meant to forget? Or not notice? I understand Bigfoot may have powers beyond our knowledge or capabilities it was very thick and very tall like over 8 feet tall and very broad across the shoulders It was covered in reddish brown fur/hair and appeared to be about six foot tall Upon looking in the tall grass, we saw where the grass had been pressed down but saw no clear print(s) All the adults were gathered at the main picnic table area & all us kids were running around having a good ole' time in the dark My husband is a logger and advide hunter-outdoorsman, so I turned to him and asked ""what was that?"" From the look of his eyes and on his face, I knew that he did not know what it was It's been a consistent “hot zone” for our WA crew, who, lacking sophisticated heat-sensing equipment, have experienced a lot of curious activity over the years including purported vocalizations, wood-knocking, powerful footfalls, branch breaking, persons being paralleled, etc  I feel like 5 minutes go by that I am staring in to the largest greenish glowing eyes I have ever seen  The arms were long and it was dark colored Also there was a faint odor of rotten meat or rotten trash??? I'm not sure if it was a bigfoot or not but it might be worth checking out I didn't even think it could be a bigfoot until the next week when I told my dad The tracks looked like bear feet but were very big and it was obvious the (thing) was walking on it's hind feet Found by two bear hunters (On foot/No dogs used) I still hadn’t heard any individual footsteps, hadn’t seen it or smelled anything; I don’t remember which way the wind was blowing, if there was one On the way back to the truck and upon leaving the clearcut and entering the woods, I felt the hair raise on the back of my neck and I thought it might be because it had gotten dark and my senses were playing tricks on me  The one going to the pasture, one going to the river (over a little rise and about 100 feet away from the clearing) and one trail that deadended 50 feet up  When I heard it the second time I was immediately perplexed by what I was hearing, followed by the kind of sensation where they say ""the hairs on the back of my neck stood up"" It strided across the road in 3-4 strides, and in as many was way off to the right again when it stopped mid-stride and looked back at me exactly like the patterson film, but this thing looked huge, even from the distance I saw it Looking down at the river, as I always do to see deer or Bald Eagles, I saw a large dark figure at the edge of the water behind some bushes I said ""You finally made it."" The thing stood up and I finally realized it was quite a bit taller that the wind break I had heard something about Bigfoot, but never really paid any attention to what I had heard  I am 6' and it was hard for me to maintain that stride We ended up turning around somewhere in between and found ourselves going around a corner with a hill coming down on the left hand side that had lots of tall pine trees and low laying brush/stumps  He described the animal as “Moving fast, using its arms to help it along, exactly like a chimpanzee does.”  He said the animal was black in color He was all solid dark color with no backpack/beltline/hat Bigfoot? I don't know  I would say the creature was at least 2.5 meters tall Then I felt faint, like I was going blind & seeing colors and shot up with some halucinogen all at once- I watched as a HUGE, hair-covered, dark cinnamon-colored human-like thing cleared the ditch in one stride, glided into the tree line in one more lightning step and then stood absolutely still There was a loud short grunt and running feet crunching in the snow, and we started firing reloading and firing Very heavy footsteps, that were rapid No foot falls, but another whoosh/thud Since it was dark, the only real description I can give is that it was huge, probably around 7', it was mostly upright, with a slight slouch, and the fur looked somewhat matted. But note I have nothing to gain or loose, but that animal I saw was your Bigfoot.  After all this time of not even considering it now that I think of that as a possiblity it makes more and more sence even though I don't truely believe in Bigfoot. I looked at Joe and he looked at me, and I swear all I could see was the whites of his eyes Now both Justin and I are very seasoned and responsible hunters and probably the last ones to shoot at noises in the dark, but this had gone far beyond that Becker that this could be the legendary 'bigfoot' that he had read about on several occasions The hike is around 6.8 miles roundtrip and can be challenging on the way up due to the 2,000 feet of elevation gain to the top of Silver Star Mountain We were about a thousand feet below and were amazed at the speed the object moved I watched this thing from about 15 feet away It’s head road low to the shoulders with very little neck showing, and it’s eyes glowed yellowish greenish white in the headlights An interesting footnote-when we returned to or base camp and were doing an after-action debriefing, I spoke to our squad's instructor about this (our squad leader objected strongly, but a few of the other members were interested); he strongly advised us to forget about it and not mention anything  The hair on the animal,in the head lights, seemed black but with brown highlights I had a ""Someones watching me feeling"" I turned around and there, approximately 10 feet in front of me,watching me play piano, is this hairy creature When doing that, I noticed some black hairs embedded in the cast around the ouside of the print After 30 seconds, it just tunred around and walked off on to legs Just calm down."" Nobody up to this point had said the word ""Bigfoot"" yet, but then as I remember someone saw the other group way down the beach, and tried to shout a warning to them I am very aware what all the animals look like and I am 100% sure this was a bigfoot When I heard the first vocalization the hair on my neck stood up and I got my hunting pistol ready for action, for fear it would come into our camp How long were its arms? B  Perhaps a person was making the noise as part of Big Foot hunting?? The other thing I'd like to report is that we feed birds and squirrels in our yard Prints were so well defined that skin texture and hair imprints could be seen  I'm absolutley convinced that I heard Bigfoot I was ahead of my Mom by 10 feet or so  The hair hanging down from the underside of it's arms was very long The first set of four knocks sounded very close and could have been about 20 feet away from the trailer There is no doubt in my mind that we had a Bigfoot experience. My theory is that the bigfoot was headed down to the water for his/her morning bath/drink and saw all of the tents and vehicles and yelled back to whoever ""The freaken Campers are Here!""  As a warning They both swore up and down they saw a very large, hairy, upright ""thing"", move very quickly out from behind a tree into thicker brush near by  We  continued to follow the trail of tracks for several hundred feet and they suddenly turned and,  what looked like, jumped off the side of the hill towards a clearing where there is a pond in the summer months Nick races out past her and some distance down the overgrown meadow along the stand of trees, where he comes abruptly face to face with a sasquatch standing on the indistinct foot path After finding the footprints, and learning all we could about Bigfoot, we were a little apprehensive about going camping at Bear Creek The combination of smells, feelings & those sounds never fully registered as being connected until we found some Bigfoot sites on the web I only ever went to my uncle's house one other time after that day and sometimes now wish I had been brave enough to have looked in the forest for footprints later but it was simply impossible to have done at the time. At the time there was about a foot of snow on the ground and the following day, another 6+ inches fell He said there are elk there all the time when he drives home but due to the size of the shoulders and color of the hair it was not an elk The windows are tall and narrow grouped three below and three above with a heavy wood beam dividing them I then noticed how far apart the eyes were 9) 10/15/75 Debbie Schmidt (another Tallick daughter): ""I was spending the night when at about 3:00 am I heard what sounded like 3 or 4 heavy footsteps with very large strides cross the yard there were two realy big adult males one skinny tall female with shoulder lenght hair and she had a bad hump on her back her breast were like a realy old women and she kept ringing her hands together as she was speaking to the other males  I went in the direction the prints were sort of headed and about 5 feet off the deer trail I found one more track we both looked at each other and confirmed that we had just seen big foot! It was amazing. each time i started back to the truck (only about 30 feet away) the brush would crash again  She said the hair was a burnt red color with gray tips  I saw it for a few seconds and told my wife that I thought I might have Just seen Bigfoot  It was a foot of what looked like a Gorilla or something So we decided to back up a few feet and take a smaller side road and turn around They estimated the animal as being 9 to 10 feet tall  As I drove closer I could see that they both had unusually long arms and that one had a more female shape and stood about 7 feet tall compared to the other which had a male shape and stood about 8 feet tall  Pretty close! My eyes flew Wide open staring into the pitch black room!!  I KNEW instantly what that was!!! 15 seconds went by… nothing, so I was closing my eyes He looked back into the darkness and continued growling as I dashed the garage, grabbed a hatchet and ran back At that time I was sure that the only thing that would make a noise like a chimp screaming would be bigfoot and I cannot imagine what else it could be. Eventually it started to get dark so we start back to the truck and as we turned around another rock was thrown from behind, landing in front of us  Armed only with a flashlight, I turned around and shined it right directly into the face of a male sasquatch standing about 10 feet away!  This creature did not act threateningly in any way, unless you count the fact that I could clearly see his teeth, I specifically remember the breadth of his chest, the smooth down, shorter, not longer hair, the funny shaped lump on top of his head (like a gorilla) and his arms/hands, which were holding some brush out of his way to see me After we got camp set up and got a fire going it started to get dark and down about a hundred feet of elevation in a two hundred yards away we heard a noise that none of us had ever heard before sort of like a really rapid yodel or tongue trill standing behind he gate was a massive creature, 6 1/2 to 7 feet tall Then just up the road about 3 miles on a different trip a few months later and while on a hike in a timbered area with snow about 3 feet deep as we went along an old logging road we started hearing tree knocks and other than us and a few plants as well as a few birds it was silent dead silent  At that point, my heart jumped into my mouth and I hollered at the guys to get there ass over to where I was and make it fast!  The Bigfoot once again turned around to me again, making the same right hand turn and looked at me for the second time but this time it turned a little faster From our estimates the figure probably 6'6"" to 7'foot tall On July 10, 2019, after whitewater rafting on the White Salmon River in Washington State I observed an extremely tall hominid walk across the river Using a stick I checked its contents, It was preditory with some hair, but also obvious had indication of berry coloring but no seeds, possibly, berry skin I wear a size 12d boot and was able to put my whole boot inside of these freshly made foot print  It took me a long stride plus a short one for me to span the distance between each foot print I never really put everything together until later when I got home and the boys comment got me to thinking about the bigfoot possibilty We did see and hear things that made the hair on the backs of our neck stand up, and never stayed up alone at the campfire. Judging my wife's size against what I had seen, I estimated it to be about 7 feet tall and weighed approximatly 500 to 600 pounds Also what struck my attention was the raised area of the foot Tallik was awakened by what she thought was an earthquake, ""But after it ended so quickly I figured it must have been a bear."" Footprints were found at the north end of the property the next day  Then it stepped over a 3 foot high stump Sound was very close- I estimate 50-75 feet at most Within seconds the dog was up and pacing the campsite and acting very nervous (hairs were stanging on his back) I watched this thing and could see that it was quite large, or bulky, because the arms and legs looked pretty huge I could see how a big flat foot would leave no print Several ears of corn were missing from the top of some of the 9' tall corn plants, husks were found on the ground I have often observed bears, and this was no bear!  Bears do not cross a road on their hind legs, although they may rear up at times This report is also mentioned in the book ""Where Bigfoot Roams,"" author Robert Michael Pyle, page 105-107. I had gone about a half-mile, and on rounding a bend in the road, I saw a tall, dark creature cross the road about 50 yards in front of me The ground had a covering of both fresh green and brown pine needles, but no evidence of footprints My first thought was why would someone walk barefooted up on the mountain Gus was growling, hair raised, ready to defend me She said it had been pretty active,& she wanted to show me around in the day light hours.We met 2 of her Big footer friends on the way down As I said earlier, the next day in daylight, what looked like a foot impression dug into heavy, wet duff was first noticed by Jamie J I sometimes hear the cry late at night that could only be a Bigfoot but I haven't seen one again I observed a creature aprox 8 foot in height in the far view of my headlights, this creature thus did cross a four lane highway in aprox 3 or 4 very fluid and unbreaking strides at a incrediably rapid pace The legs were long I saw a few tree branches moving, not like from wind and all of a sudden I saw what looked like a brownish/black shoulder and head of something, I don't know for sure what it was but I know that I've been in the woods a lot in my 51 years and nothing ever before made the hair on my neck stand up in the woods like it did that day We turned off the main road and onto a side road and rode a few hundred feet before we stopped at a bridge crossing a stream  She walked over to take a look at what might be there and saw this big, fur covered butt about 60-70 feet away Without saying anything we turned around and there was a bigfoot about 20 feet behind us, right where we had just come from We were walking along talking and all of a sudden there was a high, throaty, wailing scream (or rather three or four of them) that echoed off the mountainsides and made the hair stand up on the backs of our necks No tracks or hair were found by myself or my friends The sound stopped....we started to walk again & the sound was louder & got more strange.Like a wild pig that was whisteling under water this time.There were also 3 loud human whistles from the other side of the road, up the hill & father away.I wanted to see what was making this sound & was hoping it was a bigfoot!I went closer to the pig sound & my Mom yelled at me to get back to her.2 trees were shaking now around the pig sound in the bushes.My Mom's friends were driving down with thier jeep to meet us & my Mom was flagging them down.I really really HAD to see what it was ,so I ran to the sound.My Mom was really scared & mad at me There was maybe 15-20 yards between the new trees and the old and when the animal was a hundred or so yards off my dog kinda whined which I thought was odd because she was not afraid of anything and looking down her hair was up and she was right up against me On looking back of my two encounters, I am a firm believer that not only does Bigfoot exsist, but he is useing all of our natural resourses to his advantage Looking up and behind me, all I saw was two squirrels running panickedly down the hill through the draw and up a fir tree not more than 10 feet in front of me The hair or fur was dark brown/black/reddish tints but mostly dark from what I could see arms came to about its knees I saw hundreds of foot prints everywhere 11 feet in the trees  I had seen the film of the sasquatch spotting down in Eureka by the Patterson guy, long before this hiking/fishing trip, so the swinging of the arms and stride had sort of stuck in my mind and this thing, whatever it was, had that same movement  One of the reasons it reminded me of an ape so much was the way it’s front legs were longer than it’s back legs making it’s hind end lower than it’s front end as it ran After sneaking into position, it was dark and about 10:00pm, I hid along the edge of the field and blew the call as loud as I could I've heard they are 7- 9 ft tall I say that because of the arms The dog ran 50 feet away from our sleeping site on the beach to the ridge that separated the N and lower beaches  There was a tall cement median separating northbound lands from southbound, I thought it looked a little taller than normal, maybe 4 feet It moved its arms like a brachiating ape, overhead and down in a pretty large half-circle I thought that perhaps there was some hair hanging down over the inside of the left eye Ferns were covering parts of its legs I told my friends half-jokingly, maybe it was Bigfoot!  They laughed, but I wondered It was tall and bulky but definitely not a  bear standing upright because it didn't have the sloping shoulders of a bear but rather looked like a tall, bulky person in a cheap ape suit The odor was so heavy we could taste it and our eyes even began to water a bit  No joke, about 2 years later, I watch on TV a couple describing their face-to-face encounter with a big foot on Heather Lake Trail!  I called Cyndi and now I'm convinced that's what it was It was standing upright and I would guess it to be 8 to 9 feet tall I was backing up slowly out of fear as I’m watching the eyes move up and down rhythmically it did look massive and broad,but it still was to dark to make out a lot of detail  The tracks were starting to really show up as the snow melted - noticed my ATV tracks through the back yard from Monday or so, several sets of footprints from my son and dog, then an odd ""dotted line"" set in between all of them  It was very tall and covered in black hair The footsteps continued towards the picnic table and stopped It had the same stride as a deer would running - you know jumping through the woods  Then the thing walked up to me and my friends and came within 10 feet of us and screamed some more Dan thought, what kind of a man would be wearing a dark hairy suite that covered his entire body, out in the forest? Dan also noticed that this thing was much bigger than any man he has seen and it's build was very big! Dan felt it could weigh a good six hundred pounds or so My friend’s dad believed us as he said he had seen a bigfoot when they had lived in Moses Lake, WA It was almost as it was slow motion as it felt our eyes were locked and its head was on a swivel as we rolled by There was still a lot of dust in the air from where I had passed and all I could make out was that What I was looking at was very tall maybe (7 to 8 feet) and broad it also was very dark in color Then, we both perceived what looked like a tall man in a trenchcoat walking along the river bed [the witness is 6 feet tall] Investigator: From that picture it appears the figure is down on all fours I got home 2-1/2 hours ago from working over 14 hours and spent time looking on the web for a foot print and found that one from the Idaho site looked so close that it makes me nervous  Bigfoot, Sasquatch, Browns and Blacks, whatever they call them out here, they're real Suddenly, the foot steps stopped only a few feet from us 3 miles from mossy rock washington.we live in a wooded area on a hill there is a gully and a little river next to the house.it was about 4am thursday june 9 2010.I had awaken to the sound of what I thought was growling not loud but a few feet away from the open window we keep open and like someone hitting well what sounded like someone hitting a tree with a piece of wood with a 3 to 4 second pause between the sound.at first I thought someone was chopping wood.and we have a lot of cats and they were in protective mode growling as if something was threatening.it lasted about couple of more minutes then it stopped and got real quite.a few days ago i saw large areas of grass fields flattened wide open and around the drive way a large opening bigger than a deer in the grass.mind we do at times have coyotes and deer in the area but really this sound was made by a walking creature be it man or ?? The road was only three or so feet higher At about 12:15 I heard some fast paced foot steps beyond our field of vision Twenty feet up the hill till I saw it Bear? Well, if it was a bear, it would have had to have been standing on its' hind legs facing directly at us and not moving a muscle for at least a half an hour...probably more The instant we popped out on the bar, another huge rock lands in the water a few feet away The whole time I had not taken my eyes off it as we walked and I hadn't said anything yet because I thought it was going to turn out to be a stump or something (like when you see a burnt stump and it looks like a bear or something) 6 to 8 feet tall) broad shouldered with dark bluish/grey hair walking down a steep slope on the other side of the guardrail at the top of KM Hill We found a road that was washed out so we went on foot about 2 miles in Sunday morning, January 22, 2012 got up and looked out my bedroom window to look at the snow (we had almost 2 feet total but it had been raining for days so it was dwindling) Loop area in snohomish county and when we got to our campsite, we saw a couple large footprints along the side of the dirt road next to were we parked, i immediately disregarged it being a bigfoot and figured that it was someone with enormous feet running around barefoot prior to us getting there 'There was something standing along side of the road with red flaming eyes.' I told her it was probably a deer or some sort of animal I asked my brother-in-law about them and he said ""Oh the farmers put those out to ward off Sasquach"" Being from Michigan, I had heard about Bigfoot, but these farmers took it seriously In addition, the stride was so long that we had to jump to mimic the distance between them She knew it was a bigfoot. I put the tape in and as it showed the first picture of a Bigfoot Brenden turned to me and said, ""Grandma, I've seen one of those"" It was in the water about 5 feet from the bank Even though it was covered with hair, I could see its muscles flexing in its legs and arms When it lept or bounded, I could see no distinction between the two legs As we walked down the trails through the woods I occationally heard the sounds of twigs and branches breaking as if somthing was moving through the trees and bushes about 10-15 feet off the side of the trail We both checked to make sure that our rifles were loaded not knowing what the noise was we make our way back to our spots we had chosen to sit until dark From this position, the subject got back down completely on the ground on its right shoulder and held an open hand above its face (facing me) as if ""blocking the sun from its eyes."" (see re-creation pics #8 & #9) I could even make out pretty clearly, five spread digits on the left hand up by its face I have two pictures of the footprints, one with my shoe next to it for comparison  Upon even further examination, this time at 12x zoom I thought it was odd that the bear had really long arms, walked on two legs just as easy or more so than myself, and had a relatively short head with ape like features for a face It was about 7 1/2 or 8 feet tall and wider than most men When I got there I was surprised to see tons of barefoot tracks everywhere  Complete silence except for my breathing and muffled footsteps It had a somewhat pointed head, immense shoulders, longish arms A black hairy bipedal creature emerged from the treeline at the stream It was about 10 feet from any trees When it walked, it kept it's arms at it's side It just stood up and walked over it, walked across the road on two legs, stepped over the other guard raid, and went up into the hill across from the highway  Finally, as I got even closer, in one step from the edge of the road he jumped a distance of around 20 feet and easily cleared what I now could see was a thicket of thorny blackberry vines at least 8 feet tall, and he was gone I jumped in the truck and turned the head lights and fog lamps on and gunned the engine to get us up about 20 feet to go around the burm dividing the lot to get turned around and the truck facing whatever was walking across it As we were walking to our hunting location we heard a tree limb snap and looked to our left, we observed a large dark in color animal walking away from us  I thought it was a Bigfoot Then as im looking around I found one visible track from the bigfoot and it was bigger than the size 13 boot I was wearing and I can also see a trail of footprints not very clear prints but they were leading back into the woods with grouse feathers from a different grouse on the trail We live in different places now and alot has changed but we know what we both saw and with out a doubt it was a bigfoot.  I was chilled to the bone by the sound, the hair standing up on my body When i saw it, my shoulder blades and spine tingled, this tngle went al the way down to my feet, and i could not move a muscle I sat on my chair to put my shotgun in its' case and without really thinking, I glanced back into the forest to look at the stump We were fishing in hip waders, my friend was about 20 feet upstream from me when we heard a sound like a huge log being smacked against a tree about 100 yards away from us, I think to our west/northwest Three minutes or so had passed from the tree pounding and crunching when all of a sudden SNAP, a tree or big branch we estimated around 5 or 6 inch in diameter snapped 20 feet behind us Tallik casted the track found by the officer and showed it to me on Oct 16, 1975 as it started to get darker we both had heard what sounded like someone yelling in a deep voice then turned into what sounded like a low tone groan and then stopped, this happened at about 9:30 pm Just as I said that, we heard a heavy thumping sound, which later I thought sounded like heavy footfalls, going back down the ridge, and suddenly saw a flash of black at the bottom of the ridge as something vanished into the trees on the flat All I saw was brownish reddish hair and the creature had its right hand on the tree then put its left hand up and moved another tree and then you could not see it anymore, it was gone I was elk hunting with my grandpa and we took a spur off the main road and we drove down and found a beaver pond frozen and we stopped and ate and bout 15min later we started to head back out and my grandpa looked down a dead end spur and we got just past it and he slammed on his breaks and said I just seen bigfoot so he put it in reverse and went back fast but it was gone The older of the two then took me to the spot where they were surveying and pointed out the fur tree, which stood no more than 25 feet into thick brush from where they were standing Its eyes were directed toward me It was still getting darker when we heard the noises and we saw a bird flying overhead and swooping down and then the noise was heard My son and I are fans of the show ""Finding Bigfoot"" I was thinking about it and I think a bigfoot had scared the deer or elk into the stampede I really had not planned on looking for Bigfoot as I was busy with the logistics of putting this camping trip together I remember it being hair covered and dark brown to black The memory of it still raises goosebumps and makes the hair at the back of my neck tingle  His strides were huge From 1/01/96 to 8/22/98 I have heard the sound that was broadcasted on the segment of Evening Magazine, 3/02/99, regarding the Bigfoot investigation As we quietly proceeded down this road we were half way through the last small clear-cut, it was just about dark, you could still see in the clear-cut and a long ways down the road, but not at all past the timber's edge  Jane was laying on her stomach in a goosedown sleeping bag with her head on her arms & was petrified Anyway these were like 7 or 8 feet tall AS my boat passed in front of him (about 15 yards), I realised that this man wasn't wearing any clothes at all and he was covered completely with a very thick silver fur! Even his eyes were almost completely hidden from a thick (eyebrow?)of silver fur The footsteps sounded bipedal judging from the sound it had to be a large creature, possibly a bear, but is a bear capable of walking on two feet for such an incredible distace and is a bear able to throw bits of sticks and pebbles with its paw? its from these facts that i belive we were stalked by a bigfoot. I couldn't see its face it was too dark and there was only light from a house down the road where it became forest.  The eyes were black, the skin was grey as was his hair and he had more or less human teeth...what was left of them (Although I thought of the camera in my pack I was reluctant to take my eyes off the figure for fear I would miss something We, however, realized as we plinked that about 1/2 way along this trail that we would not have enough time left before dark to make it all the way to the logging road before dark let alone all the way back to the truck from there We were up in Cispus river valley near (Cat creek) and even over the water I could hear a scream twice and the snow was about one and a half feet deep on the roads and there was no sign that other people had traveled this area Coincidentally, our camp experienced nothing unusual our last night (August 19th)  Water was provided by a fresh water spring located about 200 yards from the house down a dark almost always moist path cut through the surrounding heavy timber The hair on my arms and the back of my neck stood straight up and I locked up the brakes and turned the steering wheel and headlights towards the trees..  It was overwhelming!  It was so strong it made my eyes water  I couldn't see the head because it was above the area illuminated by the truck lights, but I saw that the shoulders were at least three feet across, and at the shoulders it was at least 8-8.5 feet tall, and while it ran I could see the arm/shoulder movement and the thighs move as well The arms appeared to be held out slightly from the sides and reached to about mid thigh  At this point it was getting too dark to make out much detail of the thing, but it was about 4 feet shorter than the tree, dark and wide Spring of 2005 mid after noon we drove up to a place we call the Oasis (a pond on the top of one of the foot hills on Skate Creek (Mt This was in 1997 before computers and google so I had heard rumors afterwards that Washington was a hot spot for bigfoots I quickly turned around to look and I saw what I thought was a bear at first, but it was running on two feet and it stopped quickly as it saw that I turned around I never told anyone about what I had seen because growing up in the Pacific Northwest, one learns to laugh at the nutcases who claim to have seen bigfoot, and I certainly participated in the ridicule until that day Its fur was a dark brown color It was fairly dark and we looked out of the tent and saw a large dark silhouette about 150 feet from the front of the tent we were being followed by a big foot. Without moving its feet One day during a hike through the woods, My father and I heard large heavy foot steps on the opposite side of a dirt mount we were standing near He felt whatever it was must have been inside his fence, a five-foot solid wood enclosure I do not remember the exact time or date but I know it was early afternoon when I left home and almost dark when I got back home I couldn't understand how people would walk around barefoot in the rock and gravel especially when it was a very cold time of the year it looked as though something was down in the water drinking i could here the snorkling as i was standing there thinking posible elks but because the fur seemed to be dark and long kind of a burnt red color After feeding the horses in the open corral behind the barn, I would sometimes walk out into the darkness beyond the barn, and howl to see if the coyotes in the area would answer me, which they often did I said ""You finally made it."" It stood up and at this point and I realized it was a foot or two higher than the wind break So anybody that would be crazy enough to stand out in the middle of nowhere, in the dead of night by a dark dangerous river, and casually throw VERY large rocks into the water, was not the kind of person we wanted to meet at that time Ferns and other under growth are growing anywhere from waist to shoulder length, with absolutely towering trees every few feet - truely amazing with the hair on my neck standing up and goose bumps me and my friend went back to camp and started telling my father what had just happened When I was about 10 feet from the trees I had the sasquatch epiphany, so speak, realizing it might be sasquatch I think it had come down from the foot hills into the town outskirts to try to snatch a few chickens as an easy meal I've been in the woods for years, avid hunter and open minded, but I KNOW what I saw was a BIGFOOT. I looked up and the small underbrush of ferns and tall grass was moving so I went to go look at the spot thinking I spooked a deer or something About 25 minutes prior to dark we were both watching a the edge of a clearing next to an old homestead site I grabbed the hair and thought maybe it would help if I got the hair off the car The Bigfoot had red glowing eyes and the winess said he will never go back into the woods again She didn’t grow up hearing any stories of Bigfoot because she is from the Midwest It was realy close like 15 feet on a downhill slope that was steep and this thing was almost at my level  It's stride was such that it easily stepped from the road back into the brush without losing any momentum Full of a light colored hair The base of the fir was covered with a heavy coat of moss and numerous small twigs a foot to two feet long in the lower regions of the fir I walked the distance with my flashlight from the ditch to the retaining wall looking at the muddy foot prints The running on the ridgline was not a trot, or four legged run, these were distinctly two legs running weighing alot because we could hear the ground smashing.  The color was dark brownish   and the shoulders where massive Our female Newf was at our feet, as usual It was running partially on two legs and all four legs After they ran a few seconds after that we heard heavy footed running along the ridgeline above the empty pond, and at this point we ran in the vehicle and took off It was very dark and very tall and my headlights were right on it. I would have chaulked this up to maybe being a bear except for the pounding foot steps that shook the ground.. His stride was long, longer than a man's, and was effortless as he walked through the snow We hesitated about reporting this, simply because we love that area and were worried about what publicity would do to the area if indeed a bigfoot/ family of bigfeet were found there As I watched this thing, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up and I felt immediate terror The time in between each step seemed slightly longer than the time I would need in walking, especially when it appeared that the being was snapping twigs and limbs as it left our area that sounded as though they were fifty to one hundred feet away in a mere matter of two or three seconds After a quick debate about what the heck we had just seen, noting that we were not carrying firearms at the time, it was heading in our direction, and that we had two loads of elk parts on our packs, we quickly left the area I was at the lake doing a little fishing before dark when I heard a howl way off in the distance Another CA member later heard heavy footfalls several hours later about 30 yds from where I witnessed the subject, and in the early morning hours of about 3:30-4 AM, in a heavy rain, two of us in separate tents heard large (powerful) bipedal footfalls outside our tents (confirmed next day) followed by what sounded like guttural ""doe-like"" grunts My friend Mark said ""Look across the river!! What the @@#$ is that!! With just enough light we could see two huge figures standing on the ledge rock on the other side, swaying back and forth, eyes glowing turquoise green in the lantern light  I’ve never followed Bigfoot sightings or reported one before but this seemed like the best option to try and reach other folks Then we both spoke the word,  “Bigfoot”!  We both have no doubt in our minds that it was a Bigfoot that threw the rock we could find nothing that would be causing the smell but the one thing that really gave my goose bumps was there was small trees about three inches in diameter snapped about two feet up laying across the road where the smell was the most potient.(I read the night before to watch for small broken trees Back in those days I never heard of Bigfoot  At one muddy bank, the found a track where the sasquatch tried to step up the bank, but it’s foot slipped and made a long five toed slide mark in the mud The eyes were very dark but no white was seen, possibly large hairy eyebrows and the face looked like an apes and it had hair on it as well It had wide shoulders, the and eyes looked black, but to be honest I didn't look for very long I am 100% positive we saw a bigfoot that day It was standing in a ditch so it wasn't towering over me, but it was still taller than me It was hairy and extremely large I remember the boy who slept in the top bunk above me - I called him Silver Tooth for his front tooth was silver - looked out the window and said he saw several large hairy men around the water tower and the cabins and they were ten feet tall We were both watching the clear cut and it was almost too dark to shoot, when across the cut where the edge of the old growth timber was still standing came the the loudest howling, screaming carrying on that I have ever heard When we were about 15 feet from the tree, the noise stopped I am familiar with the many strange mating sounds of deer, elk, bear and other creatures - and the sound we heard that morning absolutely wasn't recognizable to me until I listened to some sound bites of bigfoot howls online  The volume and power of the scream was amazing, it made every hair stand on end I did a little checking around the area and found an elderly couple who with a little urging told me of there encounter about a year before that.The couple lived about a mile from my parents place and were in the habit of taking an evening walk up a pipeline which runs betwwen their place and my parents.One evening'as they put it,something tall,large,and hairy walked from the brush across in front of them into the timber on the other side of the pipeline.It walked on two legs,and was not in a hurry but took long strides and crossed the pipeline in about 5 strides.They said it was about 50 yards in front of them and had a very bad odor there were no foot prints. Because of that I slept on the couch, and my brother slept in the reclining chair It looked very flat footed  It is very scary, makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up, I go into my cabin, and I don't come out- this is mid morning time  The strides were very far apart There next to the rope swing on a stump sat an old man.He was very tall and dressed in grey from head to foot.( My own father is 6'6"" and I remember thinking to myself that this old man must have had him beat by at least 10 inches!) His legs were crossed and he had his hands clasped in front of his upper knee They heard some soft noises behind them and noticed a large dark object at the side of the road that they first took for a sign of some kind I followed the track up the trail for about six to eight feet and I then lost sight of the track  Also since it was around one in the afternoon and I was looking south at him I could see the shape of his head through the hair in the sun  They remained so strait, and took such long strides When the other teachers came back, they said that what we saw was not Bigfoot, but just a black man, who was camping in the treeline Helens and saw a hairy being, a sasquatch,  alongside the road After calming my wife down as she was real excited as to what we believed we had just seen, she almost yelling ""Terry it’s a bigfoot , it’s a bigfoot."" We very slowly proceeded down the hill side and up the other to see if we could find and tracks When it came in to the shoulder of my headlights I noticed that the legs weren't thin like a deer or elk they were thick  After watching for about three minutes, they played supposed bigfoot sounds and several of them WERE JUST LIKE THE ONES I/WE HEARD!! My wife who was in the next room unpacking heard the same sounds on the tv and noticing how similar they were to my renditions made a comment as to whether or not those were the same I heard I was coming up on a corner with a guardrail to my right, there is a gully with a creek at the bottom, and a telephone pole about 3 feet from the end of that, I was going 35 mph We are both experienced hunters, and this sound was unmistakably made by a animal with two legs I do not believe in Bigfoot, I still am not sure what it was I saw there was almost a hairline at the sides of its feet We found evidence of their being there, two rocks that weighed at least 200lbs were sitting one on to of the other (fresh marks on them as if one was dropped on the other from several feet) and broken branches Ex wife and I saw 2 hairy upright figures walking across the lake from us...  I froze, it froze and then it started smelling me! Deep long inhales, short outs, I could not see much thru the deck boards just something dark and big and frankly it was so frightening that this creature was just a foot or so underneath me below my feet They were even on national TV! We had not told anyone our story and this had reinforced our belief this was a bigfoot. She told me that she thought she had just seen a Bigfoot and she showed me where, by pointing to a spot on the hillside where they saw this ‘thing.’ While she was describing what she had seen and where it had come from, this creature stood up behind a bush about 75 yards from us Brenden had heard us talking about Bigfoot before but having never seen a picture of one, he did not know what they looked like A day or two later I think it was in the Seattle times newspaper there were photos taken of bigfoot prints in the snow near a fence at a ranch in the area That impression was slightly thrown off a bit by the discovery the next day in daylight where it appeared the left foot had stepped over a small foot deep berm (while subject's back to me) just beyond the 10-15 yard window the subject stayed in during the whole encounter  The hairs on my arms and neck were standing on end and it was about this time I was really wishing I had not stayed behind He was large, long arms, dark brown fur from head to toe  Then right after dark I went into the m/h, my husband came in about 30 minutes later, his sister went into their trailer about the same time, then I heard our BIL go in about 10:15 PM After hanging out at our site we heard a strange howl yell down in the creek bed the sound repeated 2 or 3 times, we were about 40 feet above the creek bed, we went down to take a look, we thought that an animal had injured itself I can't say for sure that I was that close to a Bigfoot but it sounded just like that recording I heard on TV. The legs were covered with very black and long hair and had a definite bend where a knee would be located Recently we've listened to recordings on the web of what people think are Bigfoot, and some of them sound just like what we've both heard in the area I rented a bigfoot documentary which had a recording some campers had made in Washington State somewhere in the summer of 1971 Nearby, perhaps thirty feet away, I spotted another scat of the same type  I looked around and saw the creature walking back up into the woods it had very dark brown hair covering its's entire body We walked back to our site along the water and were confronted with a bigfoot with aggression sounds at 9:15pm Let me begin by stating that my mother Renae Sampson is a member of the BFRO and has gone on multiple expeditions, is fairly knowledgable about Bigfoot activities and sightings, and has shared her stories with me  The creature I saw was on the other side of a mound, so I could not see it's legs, but it looked to be around seven feet tall I thought this was odd, and upon futher noticing, there was a brownish reddish hair on the barbed wire They were both dark though So there is my story about bigfoot I also noted that in this county, just a few months after this experience, a woman heard a bigfoot in the Teanaway area, which would be just north of where my horses were kept At around twenty yards or less I noticed from the blue/clear eyes that the deer was walking strangely She replied, 'No, it was taller than a person.' Later, the same night, Mrs  Looking under the tree where I originally saw the “stump”, I estimate it was 7 feet tall based on a tree limb it was just beneath It looked like a giant massive hairy man with massive arms they were long My husband and I were sitting by the campfire relaxing when, out of the swamp beside us, not more than 100 to 200 feet away came a noise, a screem or a grunt that changed pitch to a screech and then ended in a grunt-huffing sound, lasting a long time While deer hunting with brother, observed two sets of clearly defined footprints in mud The sound was more like the recording found by the Westen Bigfoot Society on the net (Meaning that the whole size of this foot had to have been much larger than that of any humans) It looked like a slender womans foot print Ask me about that Story!! Thank you for having this site for us to tell our Bigfoot Stories  What sticks out the most besides the eyes was huge forearms that it seemed to be proping itself up on It had to be 9 feet tall  The tree was freshly snapped off and was about 25 feet long (a young tree)  Then it hit me how very odd it seemed because of the movement and stride of the figure out of the corner of my eye Well I live in Rainier WA my name is Matthew I did not see bigfoot but I got some calls or cry's and some hooting When we started checking sasquatch noises on the internet that's when we heard again the howls and screams that we had heard in the foothills by the ocean We noticed large imprints on the bar, and subsequently found several large footprints in the soft soil by the stream We arrived at the site after dark again, I had trouble finding after such a long time (And I honestly never would, no guns or any type of weapons for my family) So we move forward, the deer slowly walking away a few feet, nibbling some leaves, me moving forward, Deer looking back at me, deer nibbling leaves, the deer never being more than 20' away from us, until we emerge from that small island of trees, cross the paved road into an empty campsite near the restrooms  I found a large humanoid footprint on a slope next to the tree It wasn't 7 feet tall, more like 6 feet or so -  I'm guessing, because it didn't seem to be bending over too far to look at me By the height of the elk, the sasquatch was about 6 feet tall.  It got very, very steep; I climbed approximately 2000 foot of gain to about 3/4 of the way up the saddle It was very late, very dark, a clear night and with few cars on the road His head and shoulders and whole body was covered with matted, whitish long hair You could see all the muscles through the dense hair As we were walking in the area I noticed some small tree that where broke off at about 8 to 9 foot height and 4 to 6 in dia., at the break It was dark and because of the fire all I could see in that direction was darkness but I felt that I was being watched and possibly being called to I'm (Name edited-out),  I had an encounter with what I know was a bigfoot Just after we had gotten to the spot that she was talking about,we heard a really weird loud whistle-whine-gurgling sound in the brush off to the right of us about 60 feet from us  He remembered the animal’s arms were “Long and skinny,” and were much longer than its legs They were bare (not bear) feet prints, about 16-18inches long X 8-10inches wide, and the tracks were about 45-60feet long, (which trailed off into an unsnowed on area)  Then to top it all off, one of them steps on the end of her sleeping bag & she feels the whoosh of the air coming up to her feet I located an interesting footprint 2) 4 to 6 weeks ago Cindie Ostenson (daughter) age 21,: ""I was driving home from work about 11:15 when I saw 2 reddish looking eyes in the middle of the road, about 7 or 8 feet off the ground It had to have been around 8 feet tall about 7 1/2 feet tall .hands, not paws I dont know if what I heard was bigfoot Definetly was a bipedal creature Previous to finding the foot prints we had been about a mile further up the mountain at a small pond  The whole incident happened so fast that she was not able to see much of the hands or feet  Then they wove sticks horizontally The next morning I walk all around the pound, hope to see a foot print but didn't The hair on it head looked like it went to its shoulders We both went inside and I didn’t let him out at night for a week after that; after dark he’d sit by the windows and occasionally growl as if he’d seen something  We were sleeping, when I was awakened by heavy footsteps walking by the tent The boys described the creature as being about 10-12 feet tall (subsequently reduced to 8' or slightly more by measurement of tree limbs under which it had passed), hair light greyish-brown own, 3""-6"" long, covering the body and most of the face, flat nose, long arms, wide shoulders and narrow hips, long legs The legs went far out to make big steps  After I got to the top of the hill I walked down a little further and at my 2 o'clock I heard a large branch snap like how a twig snaps under a man's foot and the brush crashed and I heard what sounded like a baseball bat hit a tree Being a native Pacific Northwesterner and having a heart stopping run in as an eight year old with what I still believe to have been a bigfoot, I will not discount ""stories"" of bigfoot type info until they have been researched We both looked up and saw across the ravine from us about 30 yards away, two large legs walking along a path on the upward slope  A couple coming down warned us about it getting dark and being the last ones As night progressed it got dark and fairly cold..I had a camp fire going and could see the other site a few hundred yards down the lakeside  The only reason I look back on it now is that I was watching a bigfoot special today on the history channel and they had a gentlemen on there saying bigfoot was throwing rocks at him Frank is his name and being a little eccentric his tales of bigfoot and not being caught on Divide ridge after dark were scoffed at by myself and hunting partner Justin Across the river, about a 50-70 yards away, I saw a large, black, bipedal figure with a fish (maybe a steelhead?) in its hands About four feet or more! I’m 5’8” on a good day And was looking through binoculars from its summit,when I noticed from the valley floor looking south, a large,Extremely hairy, 7.5 to 8 foot apelike creature,walking, then suddenly running at a pace that no human could match He ran back to the group a few minutes later, white around his lips, very shaken up and scared to report: ""I just saw a tall, dark, hairy thing step over the fence (4-wires high).""  After a few questions as to  ""where and when"" it happened, my son-in-law, my son, and myself headed out to the location I saw [a] bigfoot about five years ago on the Kitsap Penninsula in Washington State I had my husband try to  match his stride to those of the tracks, and he came up  VERY short We weren't really close so I had to do a little calculating, but the size of him between the cows and the 2 strides up the railroad bed made me think ""bigfoot""  The hillside was about 125 feet tall Having heard the scream so many years before, and in bigfoot documentaries, I recognized the origin Two days later, I down-loaded a Bigfoot scream, and the hair stood up on the back of my neck when I played it Before he even came to a stop he said, ""I don't know what it is."" Then I pointed to the footprint, again without saying anything What human in their right mind would continue to make these noises after we started shooting? From what I have gathered on the subject of Bigfoot my experience was a little uncommon. It was a dark blue VW Rabbit or Golf  Out my left window (west side of freeway) I saw a bunch of tall parking lot lights in the distance and what looked like a factory or warehouse a little ways maybe a thousand feet from the freeway he said a bear i said no taller than a bear like andre the giant just stepping over the rope thats how big this thing was 8 or 9 foot tall easy the following morning we went out to look for some kind of foot prints saw a couple about 4 foot split between them Once I’d had more time to calm down and think about the experience, I wondered if it was the headlights on bright that could have caused the creature to freeze & wave his arms in an attempt to block the lights from his eyes They figured from our story that for sure we saw a ""bigfoot"" Within seconds, it had quickly moved a few feet further back in the clear with its back clearly to me and what looked like the left leg slightly forward (see re-creation pics #10 & #11) and remained completely motionless for the next 40-45 seconds or so Investigator: So you didn't see any big arm movement, like when a gorilla walks quadrupedally? Witness: I didn't see the arms moving at all I'm glad I'm not the only believer! If your are ever searching for bigfoot around Enumclaw, Washington. No further investigation was carried on by the officer, but he did state to me ""Thinking about it now (Oct 14, 1975), that track could have been made by a Bigfoot, but I thought their tracks were bigger than that."" He also told me that this was the second call to this residence in the past few months  I was totally alone and concentrating on fishing when out of the corner of my right eye I noticed movement about 10 feet in the air, followed by a tremendous splash about 30 feet to my right in the stream  I got within 30 feet of my ride and heard breathing coming behind me but no footsteps My apologies that this is such a long story just about some bigfoot sounds and possible prints but I am still very excited about it all and thought that you might be interested due to this all happening in the area close to Skookum. We could feel the feet hitting the soft soil That is when I saw something about 10 - 12 feet away standing next to a tree An awful smell in the dairy barn then footprints in the barn lot leading up the hill to dense forest There were human like foot prints everywhere This large thing and myself were within probably ten feet of each other and it scared us so badly that I opened fire on it with the SAW and the blank rounds to run it off I thought it was a raccoon that my dog had attacked but when I ran to the area underneath the ridge I saw an enormous figure in the dark  It looked to be between 7 and 8 ft tall and probably weighed between 400 and 450 lbs I was living at my parent’s house that summer (2009), and spent many days visiting a friend who lived about 10min away on foot on a trail Dark red-brown hair I simply couldn't keep my eyes open any longer and quickly fell into a deep sleep My husband described it like the howling of a coyote having its legs wrenched off but far to loud for a coyote to make Tallik called in a report to the Bonney Lake Police Department that someone was sneaking around close to their home Upright figure covered in black hair walking across road 20 to 50 ft We were walking just out of the woods into the two tree farms maybe a couple hundred yards when I looked off to the right and saw a big brown object moving swiftly through the small 2- 3yr I am not sure what I saw...I do know it was in two legs and moved quicker than any human I have ever seen, through some very, thick brush. it moved side to side and was moving its arms around  Having lived in WA a few years now and having become better acquainted with what are purported to be genuine sasquatch footprints, I took note of the squared-off toes and the medially-leaning big toe I started to put things together in my mind (Track/Whistle) and the hair on the back of my neck stood up  It paid us little mind as it jogged out from behind the tree, and loped across the highway with a ""swish, swish, swish"" sound from it's feet Judging by the area behind the stump I figure it had to be about 7 feet tallk in order to be seen over the top of the stump. My feet are size 12 and when I placed my foot next to a muddy track the outline of the track was half again longer and wider than mine Suddenly I seemed to feel the presence of something very tall, something living and man like next to me One time I, and another ranch hand, went up Moses mountain when my great uncle and aunt went to a party or something and wanted to get some rabbits or grouse we had been traveling for a bit when the ranch hand shot a huge rabbit, we gathered it in his truck and proceeded up Moses Mountain, he then shot a grouse on the left side of the road at that moment I caught a glimpse of the back of what I thought was a bear out of the right, at the same time he looked over at me after shooting the grouse and his eyes widened like a guy being electrocuted, mind you this is a 2 lane dirt road uphill, he turned that old willys around in short order and hauled ass, and I kept asking WTF what are you doing? I figured I was just being silly and to make it home as soon as possible because it was starting to get dark  It was dark and in the fall, I guess it was around the first part of November  She was crouching down filling up her water jugs when she looked up and saw two yellowish looking eyes framed by black, shiny skin After hearing some prerecorded, suposed, whoops and howling from bigfoot in my area, it got me scared becuase they sounded so similar to what me and my sister heard I saw the back of this creature which was at least 5 feet above the top wire of the fence!  The horses waited probably a minute but it felt longer and then they galloped all the way back to the barn After walking about 30 more feet up the trail we heard the sound of a rock tapping on a tree, in a very repetitious pattern  I reminded him that we where in the blast area and no one normally walks in this restricted area on the side of a volcano barefoot  Almost at the same time we said that was a Big Foot! We have never told anyone about this until today at the Onalaska Sportsman Show  I recall it being black or dark brown with short to medium hair  It had long arms and a long loping gate The subject's legs were fairly long but not particularly bulky in relationship to the massive torso above the waist as the bulk appeared from the waist up into just these massive shoulders & traps with no visible neck and what appeared to be from behind-- a smallish-rounder head (no discernable sagittal crest) A couple of the boys joked maybe it's bigfoot It stood a good 3 to 4 feet above the ferns and was very dark(although it was late, and this could have made it seem darker in color)It turned its head to look back and then turned its torso and arms and as it did I could see long hair on its arms.It proceeded to walk quickly away.I proceeded to walk out and come home.I didn't tell anyone for a couple of days as I kept going over it in my head to ensure myself that this it what I actually saw and I am positive of the events the second set of windows are 7-8 feet from the outside ground They looked fresh like an hour or two old, but the size of these were bigger than mine I wear a size 12 to 13, and placed my foot next to the footprint in the mud, and it was so much bigger than mine   This morning we reached the sound we heard and discovered it was what has been previously reported as a Bigfoot vocalization. He was standing still but waving his arms across his face I could see it moving around but it was all dark It turned and looked at us right before it went into the darkness and I thought its face reminded me of a sloth He was leaning against a tree watching us and was at least 7-8 feet or taller I thought it might be a rogue bull, but given what I've heard about how BigFoot is, how he sounds, the rocky hard-to-get-to area, and the very dense vegatation I was so shocked, I could not believe what I was looking at, totally stunned Its ears were covered in black hair tight to the head She heard nothing super obvious, but immediately afterward she thinks she heard a couple of extremely light footfalls 150 yds a large dark hairy figure with facial (skin) like features bent over and what appeared to be turning over rocks we then saw stumps that were completely surrounded by branches and branches weeved into trees and looked to beds we found hand prints where the beds were we found hair trapped into the ground like a straw bed All the years before and all of them after I never saw and nobody has ever mentioned experiencing anything like a Bigfoot encounter It was very powerfully built with massive chest and arms I could see all of the toe outlines and it was much much bigger than my foot When I looked out the window I saw a pair of eyes looking back at me, glowing from the light of the TV  I was 17 at the time, but just recently, my teen age daughter, who has an interest in such matters, played me the 1978 Snohomish County recording of Bigfoot calls, and I have to admit I got a chill from hearing it, because it was, to my recollection, just what I heard on that summer night in August of '78 A large, pale ""animal""  upright on two legs A hairy tall man like figure about 7 to 8 ft we crossed it went threw the area where the big pipes are and turn right followed the road which turns in to a path i'd call it anyway we got about 100 feet, i heard what i thought was a gruggling sound i stopped and i also noticed i did hear birds everything went dead quiet then I heard a faint little whine  It moved its feet to turn around on the large stump It was black and hairy with long arms I could see the contour of muscles under the hair/fur AnimalSeen : the animals were almost 8ft except the child was 6ft tall.they were covered in fir or hair except for around there eyes and nose parts of there cheeks I left the area with enough daylight to reach my vehicle before full dark (okay, I'm not that brave) It did not run on two legs, however more like on feet and hands, not knees and hands feet and hands His arms did not swing much as he strode across the hiway  I thought to myself that maybe a bigfoot could have tossed it into the lake cause I could not see any man doing it, as it was just too big a rock and it was thrown too far out into the lake As I approached closer in the brief window of observation the creature thus did turn his head in my direction as he crossed the remaining distance of the highway, he also did appear to be covered with much hair I honestly have never really given much thought to Bigfoot before that day My friend thought he heard loud foot steps durring the night while I was asleep. I have walked this same area for awhile and this is this first time I ever found a foot print  Out of the corner of my eye, this figure, walked back and forth maybe a couple of times in the area and finally walked with a large stride, across the campsite and disappeared into the woods I contacted Jeff Lemley about getting some reports about Bigfoot stories to add to my book The main line of tracks were spaced at over 4 feet apart It was years later that i learned what it really was .I was 40 years old looking in a library when i saw something about it and what i read told of sightings of bigfoot in the same place where we lived the same years we lived there It was a fall day probably October and around 4pm and it was kind of dark and cloudy with a medium rain fall Its arms hung fairly low, coming to just above the knees When the Bigfoot came into the camp it brought me back to the night in camp and the noises I heard that night I noticed a foot print on the trail It walked on two legs  From his angle, he only saw a dark form running away from him into the woods We both had our flashlights, but it was not yet quite dark, and were still in our camouflage uniforms I guess I really didn’t think much of to until approximately a week or so later at about 9:30pm after just locking up for the night and being startled by someone frantically pounding on my store door only to open it and find a very scared fisherman who had claimed to have seen a Bigfoot within a block of my store just standing on the riverbank looking at him walk by on the road 75 feet away Furthermore, I believe and it's just my opinion, that the subject never could clearly see me (by never seeming to lock-in visually) but knew my exact presence at all times, maybe either through sound or my likely subconscious, nervous footsteps trying to position myself for better views And whatever this creature was couldn’t have been more than 15ft in front of me, growling and breathing deeply enough to raise the hair on the back of my neck again even after being chased the way I was We immediately heard movement in the dark…not loud but obviously something moving from left to right on the far side of the creek (maybe 30 feet away) Both of us looked at each other in dissmay as the figure dissapeared into the dark timber I knew bears could stand up on two legs but I knew they couldn’t walk like that..  As we were traveling about 25 MPH, i glanced down the side road, and about 75 feet down the logging road, in the middle of that road was an erect standing creature, approximately 6.5 to 7 feet tall I believe I saw a bigfoot standing in front of my car along the edge of the road. After my great uncle searched the area (rifle in hand) he asked that anyone who needed to go outside, in daylight or dark to take someone with them, then we all headed back to the ranch.I need to bounce back a bit in time, my great uncle was a great coyote caller, he could call them in to 30 feet of where he was standing, back when I was a boy (5 years to 14 years old) he would call them off the porch of the ranch house, and then you could hear them from Moses Meadows, they would get closer, he would howl, and they would get closer yet It had red hair like an Irish setter dog and a little bit matted Well we heard some loud grunts and we turned to look but it was hard to see so I had my husband turn the headlights on and we all saw three, very ugly hairy hairy people The time of the day was evening and it was pretty dark and the only lights was coming from the car headlights Immediatly I could see the ""Possible"" reason why, being that the brothers were bipedal in nature also The forest in that area is as rough as any in the Pacific Northwest and would be terribly dangerous for a man to attempt to navigate in the darkness About a mile from 080 road on slight rise that formed a small grass and moss covered table I left the trail by 10 feet to look over the ledge  The first call I didn't quite pay attention to, however the second call made my hair stand on end, and it was close (I would guesstimate within 100 yards) I believe what I heard was a bigfoot On the way up I observed 1 foot print and my son-in-law observed another one At first I was open to the idea of a ""Bigfoot"" but after this night, I was convinced One counselors said you should see the dogs here they are five feet tall  I dont sleep very sound the first night i am out in the woods and we all had firearms with us I had heard of the rock throwing on TV shows about bigfoot sightings so I immediately thought of this and I left. It was mostly covered in reddish-brown shaggy hair The bank is too steep to try to collect foot prints or pursue the creature In the morning I looked for footprints and hair, but all I found was broken branches, too high to be broken by a man. There is no sleeve ending into hands, but a continuity of dark color all the way to the finger tips There is a hill at the point of the intersection and I slowed down to the recommended speed because there is a hairpin turn just down the other side  I could see the space between its strides and I knew it had to be much bigger than a man from that distance I have seen and heard weird things there and me and my nephew seen a big foot walking towards us and my friend seen them recently and got pictures on his phone of two or maybe three of them the people who live their have seen them or heard them I believe that if you go there for not just one day and night it will take you about four to five days before you might see one if you try looking for them you wont see them but if you just camp out and hang out for awhile I am pretty sure that something will get your attention there is all kinds of signs there. I could slightly feel the vibrations of each footstep it made I thought to myself ""geez, that guy is huge"" then it began to walk up the hillside with these huge strides and effotlessly stepping over logs and swinging its' arms with a most peculular motion By this time we were about 80- 90 feet above the house and in the woods at this old single room trailer that is left up there, locked As I examined the third scat I suddenly realized that what appeared to be a large, humanlike, footprint was next to the third scat Then, the next thing I know I see a tree, in the brush, probably two feet in width (not too big, but not too small)that suddently cracked and fell up the hill! It was apparent that whatever I saw had run into the tree, probably startled by my presence because about 10 feet away from that tree was another tree, that cracked and fell up the hill in the path of the brown creature hastly departing the bushes Looking down only 12 feet or so at the bottom, was what appeared to be a large deer bed As I ran around the back of the maintenance shed, I stopped & heard a slight movement in the gravel on the hard ground....I stopped, looked over (10 feet away) & saw a HUGE black mass/shadow hunkered over the garbage cans, which were chained down Then within another 30 seconds another one while I was still sitting up, head by the open window, and complete darkness, no other human noise, quiet time and all are sleeping, and no human could make this noise as we simply cannot transmit what I will call depth and broadness of that kind of distance I have always been a believer in Bigfoot, and a fellow Bf'er and I went up there this past August to check it out Traveling North in a 4x4 truck on road FR 4828 in Easton, WA, me and a friend made a sighting of something that resembled a bigfoot What we saw was grey-ish brown colored and fully covered in hair ( take note of piece of u shaped wood because in another encounter a few years later and only a couple of months ago I had that same piece thrown at me) it got quite like I said it was cloudy and kinda dark under the tree canopy As I raced along the road it crossed their yard, leapt the 10ft ditch and landed 4 feet below on the asphalt road behind me all without stopping, tripping or stumbling once Still going left to right, we can clearly see, shiny black hair  It was a clear and still night and out in the country there it is very dark and very quiet I fished till dark then headed to my truck It was gone! I thought maybe I had moved the chair and was looking in the wrong place  It was a bare human-like footprint about 11-12 inches long He said he practically had to do the splits to match the stride: which would be about 4 to 5 feet between steps It then stepped out in plain view and dropped to ""all fours"" positioning, (see re-creation pic #3) looking over its left shoulder rotating its head in my direction as if to ""lock-in"" with arms fully extended and knees down I was terrified - the hair on my neck was standing up He had told me that it was a tree because if the bigfoot killed me he would be next I thought it might be a bear, however as it continued to cross I could tell it was way too big to be a bear sitting at roughly 7/8 foot high  Keep in mind that this all happened at once: the sound behind me;the drinking animal standing up; discovering another animal not 15-20 feet behind me Our tents were between two trees about 8 feet apart and a foot from each other and the trees As it stood up, it came from a position from squating between it's legs to a full stance It would have stuck out like a sore thumb! It was blocked by the Bigfoot.On Dave’s side was a pull-out  We also had what looks like foot prints coming out of the creek  After it had disappeared, the oddness of the stride made me look over at the campsite The figures head was about even with limbs that were a foot or so over my head, I'm six foot tall Then it picked up its stride  Soon thereafter the footsteps walked out the other end of the campsite Of course my kids said, ""Sure Mom, Bigfoot...I don't think so"" The creature was hiding in the tall timber out of view I did not see his face because he did not turn toward me so I don't know if he had a hairy face or not   That is when the hair stood up on the back of my neck & I started looking for tracks   He reports that a bear (even a large bear on it's hind legs) would not demonstrate the shoulder width that this animal did  I say this as I am almost six feet tall and this thing towered over my truck It was about 8 feet tall with a kind of shiney black hair covering most of its body I looked up Bigfoot footprints online and they described it as the mid-tarsal break The tree was not big maybe 20 feet tall It looked like a huge flat footed huge toed person We have really tried to discount the idea that it was something else we saw, but we know what it was, a Big Foot I know what deer and elk sound like and this sounded like two feet running through the woods at a sprint Jim came to back me up he did not know what in the hell was going on and instead of telling him to stop I just kept my eyes glued to the spot I knew the guy was at and he finally decided to move out.He took two strides up the bank away from me with a look over his right shoulder as he was moving away to the right Only way I can describe it is like a football punt I am also convinced that I was so close to one that I could have reached out and touched it without any effort at all in that total darkness. What I saw made the hair stand on the back of my neck, and got tears in my eyes The trees were mostly 30 plus foot alders and thick under brush Two things happened almost simultaneously, we heard the yap of a single coyote, very close by, which was strange, they almost always travel in packs, then we heard something very large, scrambling up the bank, no more than 20 feet away  About halfway through my scan, my eyes stopped on what I thought was a guy trying to get cell phone service (yes the giant phones of 1996 did kinda work at the top of the small hill) on a little hill directly across from the boat launch When it did so, R-- said that for a few moments he could see daylight under the stump----as if he were looking between someones' legs, which then disappeared after it moved It was a large hair covered man/ape and because I was above and to an angle of it hadn't seen me yet My brother walked up the bank and had to nearly jump from track to track to make the stride! It wasn't until we walked over to the other side of the road and looked down into where this thing went that fear started settling in It was after dark when we left and not being originally from the area, it was difficult to get my bearings This mat was partially sunk into the dirt on the edge of it by a 15""-16"" human looking footprint, it was maybe 6"" wide and 1/2"" deep  She also made a sweet little walk-way from the fire pit to one of the camp spaces about 40 feet away  It was 6-61/2 feet tall, covered in dark brown to cinnamon colored hair about 3-4 inches long, dark skin on its face and hands, dark eyes set close together, flat nose, large mouth with thin lips with what I would describe an alarmed look on its face.As I turned to see what had made the noise behind me I found my self looking at two huge legs of a larger animal perhaps 8-9 feet in height It's arms stretched high like a man's not like a bear and I didn't see a longer nose like a black bear has, it was like a man not a dog's face My binoculars are not very good but I immediately noticed that they carried no equipment (no bags, no sticks...)and that they seemed to be very tall icould see it was hairy form the backround of the sky, but it was too dark to see any facial details I don't want to tell  you right now exactly where I was because it's my hunting area but I would like to talk to someone knowledgeable about Bigfoot Something that we began to notice as we looked around was that we saw a few other stumps but none of them were as large or as tall as the ""stump"" we were looking at, nor were there any trees that were even close to the diameter of our stump anywhere As I drove down the logging road, up ahead along the side of the road I saw two tall people walking in the direction I was heading I feel the end of my tent beyond my feet on the inflated bed my son and I are sleeping on LIFTS UP! And then its placed gently back on the ground, like floating down! I reach out to touch my son and he is facing away from me with his arms and hands under the covers Also the ""soles"" of its feet appeared to be devoid of hair Where the ball of the human foot is straight across, this seemed to bump up in the middle but no sign of toes It was almost black with alot of gray hair the kids always talked how Bigfoot lived on Bells Mountain From this positioning the very agile subject appeared to ""pop-up"" from the ground clearly using no arms and quickly backed behind the initial tree I first witnessed it from  When the laser light hit the creatures, they could see hair about four inches long  When I looked at where the noise came from and I saw to my horror a rock come towards me from out of the bushes and my eyes caught the hand throwing the rock, and when I noticed the hand I saw it jump in the air and do a 180 spin so it would be faced away from me when it landed and I swear to god it threw the rock so freakin hard that the entire rock didn't spin at all when it was being chucked  Took a picture from my window, went to church, then came back and took more close up shots and measured the distance between the ""steps"" which were between 5 and 6 feet consistently Laying there I began to hear sounds coming from probably no more than 50 to 100 feet behind our tent  As I looked around the area I found that there wasn’t just one rock, but nearly a hundred rocks all about fist sized laying around the area, about five to fifteen feet from the wood-line I was convinced this was Bigfoot My Golden Retriever was sound asleep for most of the vocalization but woke up for the last 15 seconds and immediately bacame alert peering out into the darkness I don't recall much of the face but what I do clearly remember was noticing the shape of the head was not at all like a bear, more like a tall bump off of massive shoulders and that there was no snout (that part I noticed as it finished looking away from me) And then I saw it what makes me believe in Bigfoot  My father and I did go out on the porch and look around a bit upon hearing the screams, but did not leave the area of the house in the darkness.  When we locked eyes, it looked even more annoyed or disappointed and maybe a little scared Jim (my then husband) Vic and I watched two taller and one smaller brownish creatures move back and forth for about ten miniutes None of that! It makes the hair stand on my neck as I recount this incident even though it has been nearly 30 years ago!  They seemed agitated and with their feet stationary they turned and looked at both sides of the road by rotated their upper bodies at the waste back and forth, back and forth while swinging their arms at their sides  The tree was snapped off about ten feet up, cleared from the trunk, and laying directly across the trail as to block it It was quite small....maybe 5'2"", 150lbs, standing on two legs, covered with hair He spread his legs out next to the tracks to compare the stride It was about 7 feet tall, dark brown in colour and it had it's back to him so he got on his hands and knees and watched this thing called Bigfoot that he had heard about in this area That was a damned bigfoot"" In my opinion, there's absolutely nothing else it could have been. After it passed my tent I continued to hear soft bipedal footfalls around our camp When I looked out side I noticed the outline of a pair of legs strolling through my neighbors yard There were no regular trails, the terrain was steep, and slippery, the nearest house about 800 feet away A 4-foot cyclone fence ran alongside the lane, with open gates at intervals   after a while i desided to hike over the the other side and see if thier was any fresh sign  as i got toward the top of the other side i heard alot of niose and something going over the hill toward the canyon, i approached slow but never saw anything but thier was this god awful smell in the air ,its hard to explain but it smelled like a  wet old musty dog that had rolled in some cow manure  but really strong and stinky  it was not plesent to say the least i thought maybe it was a bear cause ive smelled bear before but it was just different,the next morning I went to the same place and waited, i heard noise down the revine aways , a few minutes later i saw something walking up the otherside of the hill, thought it was a bear but looked through my scope and was looking at a gorrila type animal, it didnt really look like a gorrila but thats all i could think of it didnt seem real big , i was probably 80 to 100 yards away ,its head was wide and tall its arms were big and they didnt go past its knees ,about like a mans , thick hair on back, top of head and legs  thinner on chest and face i moved, kneeled down behind stump and pickup my binocs,  it heard me and the noise it made was unreal Afterthoughts: What we saw was not a bear; its arms/front legs were way too long Huge foot print She said ""the long reddish brown hair swung back and forth as it swung it's arms  It was definitely larger than any man's foot I have ever seen We pulled into the muddy rock pit(we were driving a '69 220 Mercedes) drove in about 50 feet and then noticed something in front of the car  Then, as it looked at me, I saw total intelligence in its eyes My heart sunk as I watch a lot of bigfoot documentaries If you have never been to the wilderness of the Pacific Northwest, let me tell you - it is DENSE! I mean, there could be a hundred Bigfoots within twenty yards of you and you wouldn't see them Two loud thumping sounds on a tree and then followed by a low growling into a woofing sound ending in a high pitch screaming, 200 feet from our camp the first thing that really caught out eyes was reading of their stench There was something standing out there in the dark, large and not scared of us, which for any manner of ""known"" species in our mountains is unusual When I looked at the area where it crossed I was unable to discern any tracks in the gravel that I could definately say were footprints It was about 8:15pm in late November 2014 so it was dark, chilly, and clear outside 7) 10/12/75 Backdoor neighbors to the Tallik's, Jennie Dempi heard a dog barking up against the side of the house she was babysitting in, then heard something heavy run across the roof Investigator: So did you try to look for any impressions or footprints? Witness: No actually, I can say no, I didn't  Sorry if this report is so cold; had I known what I was looking at, I might have looked for footprints or even perhaps could have checked for hair samples After I told her what clips were played she freaked out and said, ""Shut it off! Doesn't it give you chills."" She is still freaked out when I play it.....I don't know what it could be but would like to know if it was a bigfoot. I have been around cattle all my life and never seen this before, the hair smelled awful  I kept looking at it thinking is that a stump or something else?  The shape looked like a tall black figure standing upright, leaning forward with very long arms down to its knees The size of the print was only about a size 11 size foot Taking a flashlight with me I went over to the highway and looked at the foot prints of mud crossing the road leading from the hill side He subsequently found foot prints, 17"" long, 8"" wide at ball and 4"" at heel, and traced them down river for about 0.5 miles before the track entered the water. He slowed down and as he came abreast of it (about 20 mph)their eyes met It became darker on his main body, but was lighter on his face and chest area My girlfriend ask me ""what is that"" I looked to see a hairy head moving along the road The shoulder was absolutely massive, as was the arm, which was so long, it was almost as tall as I am  Our site was protected underneath the forest canopy, with the river bank approximately 20 feet away I did find about 12 feet from the fir tree a pad print (much like a large wide human print dressed in a moccasin) After we got out of the jeep we walked about ten feet and heard a few quick knocks which sounded like a big stick hitting a tree, almost like someone knocking on a door It happened so long ago it seems surreal to me but I saw bigfoot with my friend in 1974 in Woodinville Washington  My window was down and I was no more than 20 feet from him When I smoked outside at night I would hear what sounded like an elephant smashing through the ten feet tall blackberry bushes towards me We were walking down the road it was a little soft from the night before rain and dense low fog.W e were loking for sign when we encountered the tracks right on top of where are tires had just rolled something had followed our vehicle.At first we thought it was a big bear immediately we were on alert.As we examined the tracks more closely we determined that bears dont walk on their hind feet for this long of a period of time.There was no front paw tracks!We continued on our drive encircleing the area.On our way thru the thick buckbrush heading west back to the truck we started hearing noises,something was now tracking us.We could smell a strong oder that was like cat urine or a dirty cat box.At this point we were both scared we could hear it smell it but we could not see it.The visibility in this brush was near 5ft.in most places besides the trail we were on where you could see 20ft to the front or rear of you.We started to move faster for the truck as we sped up so did it.The brush behind us was cracking so we took cover behind 2 trees each of us on the oposite side of each other aiming to where the noise was.At this time whatever it was squealed in a high pitch(almost like a woman giving birth)and took off running n.w (We have eight foot tall ceilings) When you jumped across the creek, how is it you could see it through the trees?  B I even crouched low to see if I could spot moving legs-nothing  On my next trip to same location had again been there for a couple of hours when I heard a big splash from a very big rock landing in the lake several feet out in the water I (Brian) went fishing going down steam while Carla and Cindy walked up river, I walked around a bend I saw a big tree that looked like lightning hit it, but while looking at it better, steam was coming off it, then the top foot and a half turned slowly to where I saw the whites of its eyes, his hair looked like bark, he was squatting, sitting on it heals with knees to its chest, it really looked like a tree broken off This was amazing and intense and absolutely true I was definitely skeptical about the existence of Bigfoot before this trip and now I have absolutely no doubt that they are real. I probably saw it cover about 100 feet very quickly, and it was soon out of my field of vision  She could see the eyes, nose, cheeks, and forehead My son told us the ""thing"" was walking upright, had long hair ""all over"" and said ""it stepped over the fence"" and was ""real tall"" There in the dried creek bed was a huge footprint It's just a regular Ford pickup so it's the width of the pickup, brush rubs both sides of the truck so eight or nine feet  A large, dark and hulking figure loomed up at the other end of a clearing about 50 feet in front of me and ran to my front for about 20 feet I was close to the ponds on the field side and my friend was behind me about 10 or 15 feet on the field side The other time was when my brother and I were in the yard at about 9 o'clock at night, and it was very dark I don't know what it was but it was tall and very muscular, like a linebacker We didn't put this incident together with finding the prints a very short time later till after researching the prints we had found and reading about other peoples encounters with bigfoot  As it got closer I could hear branches breaking underfoot It was too dark at the point to pursue any bull so I decided to make a cup of coffee, fire up my lantern and do a little reading before crawling into my truck tent for the night If you know somthin that would or could pick up a rather large rock and just drop it I would like to hear from you cause the only thing I can think of it being is bigfoot I suspected Bigfoot but didn't know what it sounded like at the time  That's when my dad and I  saw this creature step over a log and proceed to walk down hill on 2 legs and that's when the other 2 followed it  She said it had hair covering its entire body and she noticed hair hanging from its arms  Just as the Boat was leaving the landing I saw something large and dark walking on the shore were a creek (I believe it's called Holden creek) runs into the lake I drove back by the site my next day on my way to Oregon, during the day time, and confirmed that the cement median is a solid 5 foot high He looked back at Dan several times without breaking his stride One of the more intense memories of this incident was hearing that noise; distinctive impacts with the ground on not four, but two feet, and the smacking of bare feet on asphalt when it hit the driveway  Immediately we could tell it was on two feet; assuming that it was a person, I thought they were jumping from foot to foot As we began to stir around 7:30am and decided to continue with our plan to take a hike through the woods, a large, dark, agile creature ran crashing into the forest as we approached It was a very tall person with thicker and longer than usual arms and legs; I could only see the silhouette of him and he seemed to be in a hurry and he was crossing the road in front of where we had stopped The footprint was found near the front porch and next to it was a large piece of driftwood that was originally in the backyard garden The first thing that happened was my two outside dogs were barking at something at the corner where the creek ran through then they came running back to the house with their hair up and wouldn't leave the front porch so I looked to where they stopped and thought that I seen someone standing by a tree the two large males were realy huge large broad shoulders, the female was tall thin with large hump on back between her shoulder blades,her breast saged near her waist. What I saw was slightly taller than a speed limit/road sign First of all I'm 18 yrs old and I've had 4 encounters with bigfoot Totaly amazing they said watching it take off running down the road with huge strides, then as the plane got almost over the top it leeped off the road running uphill jumping stumps like nothing, they spun around for another look and it was gone. A Footprint was found by the police officer and the next day casted and photographed  3 of us walked down and as we walked the trail every 10-30 yards were fresh trees broken over at about 5 to 8 feet Out in the dark swamp 6 feet below me about 35 yards away I saw a pair animal eyes moving towards me Since that night I can confidently say that I was stalked, followed, and then chased by a Bigfoot, that then was dissuaded by the presence of my dog and the light of the house so near. Not right when I got there but after a little bit of looking around I noticed a smell, it wasnt very strong like ive heard of a bigfoot smell but there definatly was a different smell there I became greatly alarmed because whatever was creating the disturbance had been following us for quite a distance as i began paying more attention to the sounds of branches breaking i could hear that they were footstepts, just like the ones a human would make walking through the brush, i knew in my heart that it was a bipeadal creature at that point Then what really caught my attention was he was swinging his arms back and forth One was about 7 to 8 foot, the other was about 7 ft but it wasn't as hairy and the little little one was about the size of a kid, age range from 7 to 9 years The construction was unbelievable; the under growth was woven to form a about a seven foot tunnel leading to a larger doomed inner room, about the size of a mid-sized car Although the stump was not a big foot, we both heard that most chilling screaming which must have lasted 45 seconds to a minute As we lost sight of it we knew it was a juvenile Bigfoot. I was able to determine that it was possibly a right foot because of what apeared to be a distinctive big toe He witnessed a 7-8 foot creature, walk from the side of the road into the forest We had to drag those bales up on foot, from the road  The animal was in bright sunlight as it crossed the road - there was no mistaking it for a bear - and bears don't have 6 ft strides But sure enough, once it got dark and we got in the tent, we started to smell the most awful stench, like rotting garbage, or a wet dog, but worse The strides were enormous Box 140 Joyce Washington give the following account in a sequence of events leading me to believe of an encounter with a Sasquatch (Bigfoot), according to information directly given and acquired through my personal investigation  I have very bad eyesight, though, so after looking and listening for a minute and seeing nothing obvious, I went to get my glasses I listened to the Bigfoot Scream 1978 Snohomish recording and yes, indeed, it sounded exactly like that!  The difference is that we heard only one scream, not a series of consecutive screams I got a little nervous and whistled to let it know of my presence and that is when I realized this set of eyes are connected to an animal walking on two legs! After the whistle the animal looked at me and walked off slowly looking over its shoulder As I started back up in the direction of the car I heard 2 loud wacks of wood on wood about 6 or 7 seconds apart and about 300 feet above and to the right of me Suddenly… Bang…Bang…Bang!!! It sounded like 2 baseball bats being slammed together, about 3 seconds apart!  It seemed like it was coming from the rivers’ edge, or closer? 60 feet, 100 feet away  It was about 3 feet tall as it ran on all fours, stocky and thick with a dark brownish color"
West Virginia,"About that time, I heard footsteps behind me and turned to see a couple of men walking down a trail carrying garbage bags on their backs I am 5'9"" and have fairly long legs and I could not put my foot beside one of the prints and reach the other one i could not see anything but the two legs and the rear end of this thing because the window has a blind on it that was halfway down  There was very little hair on the face and I remember thinking he looked like the very kind and wise black gentleman that my Father knew tall, and they are all in a row and real close together He was covered in reddish brown hair and about six feet tall It had thick black hands and feet and I would guess that it was about 6'5 to 7'0 tall and again was moving up hill through rocks very quickly It was very cool looking..about 7ft tall, it had very dark large pupils and around the pupils its eyes were almost owl like..it had brownish blond fur and it had a visible face..it almost looked like the troll faces that you used to put on your pencils as kids..really..but, it was very clean looking and not what you would expect..its fingers were long and thick with no fur and it had dark fingernails..I had my scope on 9 power and it was equivalent to being about 30 ft from me visually..it was real and I would take a polygraph and swear on my life. I could see the gaps of air between their arms and torso -- unlike the humans who were so bundled up with rain gear that you could not see any gaps betwen their arms and torsos no distinct footprints though. It was about 25 feet below me on the slope and directly in front of the stand All I found was what appears to be footprints I took and still have pictures of them Hair covered most of its face but it looked to be thin hair, not like the rest of it I could tell this one was only a couple inches taller than me (6-7) I did not see eyes, I got the impression it had closed its eyes when it was startled by my headlights I can only come up with one conclusion; I saw and heard a ""Bigfoot"" It took me a long time to tell anyone other than my parents and wife I can't drive by that place in the dark to this day without thinking of that creature and praying that I never see it again and if I do that someone will be with me It must have been at least eight feet tall and four feet wide at the shoulders and no neck that I could see I went over and sat on a log to eat and my husband asked me what kind of track was by my foot, When I looked down I was astounded! My husband wears a size 13 boot, And this was in cold weather so the thick boots make his foot look even bigger and this footprint made his look small! it was atleast 16 to 18 in long and 6 to 8 in at the widest point.There were about 3 or 4 more footprints leading down to the creek Then I heard a crunch and a thud as the footsteps went over the side of the hill to our left, circled around until it was right beside us at the bottom of the hill  By the time it jumped, we were within 80-100 feet of it But that feeling of being scrutinized was raising the hair on my neck All was normal down the first hollow, but when we started up the second, the dogs returned in an agitated state, and began to growl and raise the hair on their backs I was alone, driving after dark from Belington, WV on US 250 North (two lane highway) toward Philippi, WV I beeped my horn at it.He started to run very fast, in long strides and then I realized it wasn't a man I would estimate we had gone about another 2-3 miles on foot before we reached the crest of the mountain and decided to find our hunting spots My financee said, “Holy crap, I just saw Bigfoot, 3 possibly 4!""  We turned around and high tailed it back to the spot After the car had passed it was dark again and he heard something huff and puff and then it sounded like it took off up the hill running towards us so we ran to the house about 30 yards away 200 yrds above her...when she passed the well...a natural spring this creature stood up...it was tall, broad shouldered with arms hanging to below its knees...it was hairy but..not thick hair..I could see skin on it's back...I screamed for my sister to run...she turned toward me...saw this creature and ran..I can still see dust rise from her feet as she ran...this creature immediately stooped back down and entered the brush along side the creek below ne...it moved faster than anything that large should be able to move...We told our Grandmother..she said it had always been there and was just getting water...she also said that her dogs were scared to come out from under the house when it was around...she said it liked to wander around on damp rainy nights...This is no hoax...I am a science major, a registered nurse, who remembers an incident that can not be explained unless Bigfoot is real...I believe we saw a Bigfoot and I believe he still lives up Shop Hollow...Slate Creek area in Mcdowell County. we were terrified...it was very tall...blackish colored hair..also was skinny in appearance with a tapered face From the ground upward, the rock face was mostly bare for about the first 15 feet The night was dark, clear skies but the moon had set, and not much starlight in the thick forest It would be several more years before any of us ever heard of Bigfoot  As it started walking (definitely walking upright on two legs) we noticed that it seemed to be a brown color with fur like a grizzly bear or something to that nature  The eyes glowed yellowish/amber as my lights hit them; the being had long brownish fur with strands of white (maybe) through it; it appeared matted, or dreadlocked; the feature that struck me most was the size of the thing-- I can't even imagine the actual numbers but, I have a 300 pound Brother-in-law and a 6'3"" tall Brother and they both would have been dwarfed by this guy, both in height and weight  We then turned and looked at each other and said, “Is that Bigfoot?!”  No way, we thought At approximately 4 AM, I was awaken to heavy footsteps walking down over the near vertical high wall  When my boss and another technician showed up, the 5 of us walked to where I had seen the Bigfoot I also realized it was very tall, and had very wide shoulders and its arms hung very low almost to its knees, if not below I stopped and got cold chills, about 30 yards east of me on a 45 degree angle at 4:43 pm I saw the back side of a orange and brownish haired thing moving up hill quick  Until I found a bigfoot website with sound recordings It was about eight to nine feet tall My next thought is that it was a bear, but it walked away out of view moments after I had eyes on it, on two feet, and carried a staff with it On the path we found 2 separate footprints that were human like but huge The one below me sprang to its feet and then moved about 15-20 feet to the right of me  When it started to walk away it walked mostly upright on 2 legs swinging its arms and still looking at us until it turned its head to the hay field and walked away The footprint was visible but not deep in the soil But, it became evident my buddy didn't believe tht Bigfoot had made the footprint The larger appeared to be at least 7 to 8 foot tall The hair went down its arms and hands as well as its feet Because it happened to be very hot during the day, I laid the newspaper down on the ground to put my hair up The footprints went up the mountain and crossed a fence This is a man standing 6' tall and over 300 lbs Now I have hunted alone many times and had never been afraid of anything but just after I had moved on I began to hear what sounded like foot steps in the woods just behind me and parelling me 50 to 75 ft  It was a very large animal about 7 foot tall standing across the hay field at the other fence post Then I came across the recording section on this website and listened to the recording from Snohomish County, WA and not only did my dad freak out but the hair on both my arms stood straight up and I was covered in goose bumps  My eyes even tear up a bit when I make the woooop sounds We shined our lights up the hill and saw a rather large figure about seven to eight feet tall and rather thick, step back into the darkness and disappear In 2009 during the riffle buck (deer) season I was hunting in Slaughters Creek, Kanawha County, West Virginia out on a mining/logging rd when I saw what I thought to be a bear until I got about 80 yrds from the creature it was upright around 7 1/2 ft tall & looked like a linebacker, huge there was a stench in the air like a combination of wet dog & body odor as I walked up the road It’s head was kind of pointed and no hair on its face which looked almost human  It was about 300-400 feet ahead, and while we continued towards it, it spun around, similar to an about face, but with the head dropping and a semi-crouch as it was turning all i could see was a massive, coal black, very shaggy haired creature standing there on two very bulky legs looking in the window at me It was evening with about two hours of daylight left and I noticed movement about 60 yards towards the gorge from my position..I raised my gun to view the movement through the scope..after holding it in position for 10 sec or so I saw a very large hand appear from the side of a large Poplar tree..it was palm against the tree and I saw fingers mostly..then to my surprise I saw a head peek from around the large tree and two LARGE eyes affixed on a head if a creature I've never seen before..and I'm a hunter..have been since I was 8..I'm now 38.  The only thing that we could think of was Bigfoot but the thought of it made no sense On Saturday morning, he and a common school friend of ours, and myself ,left out on foot at approx The eyes were a bluish green color and appeared to be 5-6 foot off the ground His feet looked hairy Coming back that way after my delivery, it was dark and I saw no sign of it anywhere The ""animal"" stood up, on two legs like a man, was gray, and hairy all over  They were tree-trunk dark I parked with the left side of my vehicle facing towards the wilderness line which was about 100 feet uphill  And, I remembered him (I say ""him"" because I got the distinct impression of masculinity from this enormous creature-- barrel chest, thick arms and legs and just a ""maleness"" to it's movements) turning his head to face me and it turned in a way to suggest that it was looking TOWARD the clearing where the fire was burning In the fall of about 1960, while coon hunting with my grandfather and friend named Bill, we had an encounter with what I am now convinced was a Bigfoot It appeared to be barefooted and at one point running. We live in a pretty dark (not much light in this area at all) heavily wooded and somewhat quiet area just outside of town  It really began to catch our attention due to the fact that it was a good 4 feet taller than the fence and standing on two legs  I would conservatively estimate the creature to have been at least 400lbs and every bit of 7 feet tall I started the car and turned on the lights and when I did this ""thing"" covered it's face, as if to shield it's eyes from the car lights and quickly hurried behind some trees and thick brush It was about 5 feet tall with long dark, reddish-brown hair  When the object got to the middle of the road it turned its head and looked in my direction, at this time I got a real good look at it, about 8 to 9 feet tall very heavy build, long lanky arms, long dark red hair, very long stride (about two and a half steps to cross road) One late fall afternoon I was just walking with my .22 mag rifle at the ready quietly along the tracks when I heard a noise or a rustling of leaves in the woods when I suddenly stop and stood motionless while I scanned the woods with my eyes looking for the source of the noise thinking it my be a large gray or fox squirrel  As we left the area, my arms and neck were covered in goose-flesh, and we were both speechless for about 10 minutes. They moved about 40-50 feet to the right of me It had no distinguishable facial features, because it was so hairy We came up on a mud hole probably about 12-15 feet long it had three huge foot prints crossing it It stood frozen as if surprised by my headlights, very stiff, with extra long arms down by its sides  Its arms hung down its side just above its knees, and its shoulder and mid drift were real broad From what I could see it had very large human-like eyes and very large round nostrils Very tall, fuzzy looking, with primate features, similar to an ape.  I got to admit, I was not a bigfoot believer until that night However, I could sense the largeness of what had to be Bigfoot As we sat there, the atmosphere of such wilderness led my thoughts to Bigfoot At first I thought it was a large man, as the first thing I saw through my scope was a vague silhouette, but when my eyes focused I could see what appeared to be a primate-like creature standing upright and staring directly at me The hair from its head down its body was of equal length, about 2-3 inches long  But it was either a human clothed from head to toe in a dark color on a summer day wearing dark gloves or it was something else. His description was black, straight hair, walking on two legs, and atleast 8 feet tall I was trying to hold the light on the creature’s eyes, and hold the light so my friend could see so he did not fall Without our headlights, it was completely dark with just a little moonlight As we struggled to get across I noticed the eyes disappeared During this time several drain pipes around our home were knocked down and what ever did this left many large, human-like footprints It was big and had long arms down its side The smaller ones were 2 foot smaller This is what he says that he saw: human-like figure, at least six feet tall and very bulky, with very long hair (""the hairiest thing I've ever seen"")  Anyway what we thought was strange was after it stood up it heard us at our back door,and turned its head our way and when it did we saw big yellow like eyes, we looked at each other to make sure we both were seeing the same thing While walking down the road one night me and a friend heard a strange vocalization then the sound of heavy footsteps coming down the field to our right I kept my eyes moving between the one below me and the direction of the disturbance coming down the hill Just as I turned around, I saw a Very Tall and muscular looking figure walk out from the trees, and cross the road We each left there that day convinced that we had encountered a bigfoot at Glad Run Pond  about 40 yards in front of us, a large bipedal creature crossed the road By now all the dogs except one were nearly under our feet, making it difficult to walk Suddenly, I got an innate sense that something sizable was peering at the tent...I felt a presence there in the pines, which were about 15 feet away Then next morning my family and I went outside and began looking around and found footprints about 14"" or 15"" inches long, and 4 or 5 feet span between each one in our garden I was shining my light around in the woods around me, when I saw a set of eyes looking at me The creatures eyes would blink every now and then but it did not show any fear toward us or the dog By the time we reached the branch that we we're to follow back up the mountain,time was slipping away, and the thought of getting caught in the dark became apparent.After an hour or so of hiking up the branch, the sun had lazily rolled over the mountain top, and although it was still early, it was begining to get a little dusky in the hollow All of a sudden we heard something move down over the hill so I whispered ""shush, if we’re quiet we may see a deer."" We continued to sit there, about 2 min, until a car came down the hill and its lights flashed on something tall standing near the bottom They didn't say anything for a few seconds, then looked down at the ground, kind of averting their eyes  He then went to look for it and saw it foot imprint on some leaves on the ground, he said they weren't very good but he could see that its foot prints where about 5 feet apart It was about 8-10 feet tall, fur from head to toe, and was extremely thick and muscular At first I thought it was a very tall, lanky human, at least 6’4”, with long reddish hair and a long beard, but as I got closer, I realized there were no clothes, just reddish brown hair over its entire body It seemed as if my hair stood up and I had a bitter taste in my mouth, I suppose from adrenalin My buddy was quite intrigued by the footprint  She said that as she was driving her Jeep that way, the huge black creature was covering a lot of ground ON TWO LEGS – not running, but covering a lot of territory About 50 feet down the road, all of a sudden we see this tall, hairy, lanky, glowing eyes of a creature running North on our side of the road My first thought was that it was a “skinny Bigfoot”, but that those things don’t exist and if they do exist, they are not in WV, they are in the Pacific Northwest Redish eyes The neighborhood dogs go crazy sometimes, and one night, afterdark, I got out of my car in my driveway, something was on the mountainside screaming The foot prints looked like a barefoot human foot  We both noticed that the weeds at this point and all along the area, were even with the hood on the 3/4 ton Chevy pickup we were in, making the estimate on the height of the creature at about 7-7 1/2 ft tall As we were walking back to the truck, I was hollering for my dog to come on, and I shined my light up in the woods where we left from, and the set of eyes returned It did not use its arms They stared intently into the darkness in the direction we were moving, and would not get more than a few yards away, all the while growling, acting in a way we had not seen before  I estimated by tree limbs over us it had to be at least 7 feet tall I had chills all over and tears were rolling out of my eyes The animal was standing on it's back legs and was only around 6' tall We had just stopped to take a breather when we heard rustling on an old logging road about 300' feet above us After hearing them again a few more times, one night it got real close but sounded like it was keeping its voice down low, then I heard three distinct grunts directly behind me, turning to look I could see nothing at all with the fire blazing and my eyes not adjusted to the dark The bigger one was covered in very dark hair, almost black I beeped my horn thinking it was a bob cat and up jumped this light tan (just a little bit darker than the deers skin) thing I still have a hard time calling it a bigfoot  Such as smells, footprints, and noises, But none of them had ever said they actually saw something  I got out of the tent and saw nothing, it was too dark When a small deer ran across the road in front of me so I slowed down...as I slow down I noticed something running through the woods off to my right...it was six feet tall approximately with black hair that walked upright on two legs ...it was moving much too fast to be a person and was definitely not a deer Where it crossed the fence, I found some strands of hair caught in the wire. It was black and walking on all fours, its front legs were longer than the back legs It was very muscular and its arms were noticeably long I would like to preface this report with a small fact: I have always wanted to see a Bigfoot Any thoughts of Bigfoot, (there had been previous reports) were largely in the back of my mind, although the prospect of possibly encountering or seeing evidence was exciting to consider Their eyes kind of flew open for a second, then they gave me a look like I was crazy  My hair was literally standing on end She said that the hand was covered on top with coarse looking hair and it had black fingernails It was walking about 50 yards below us and when we finally got a good look at it we could see it was a bigfoot Half jokingly and half serious I asked them if they had heard tales of Bigfoot in the area The hair was all even in length I realized the trail I took started to fade and I was lost, after going downhill a little while through rough rocky, tree filled and bush filled terrain that is home to deer, bear, and snakes, I heard thumps (footsteps) and tree branches cracking Two minutes later the creature took off into a stride across the field with its arms swinging at its side and a slight bend to its form I tried to move my eyes to the left but my view was blocked by the trees that was holding up my stand and partially by the full-brim hat I was wearing I tried to go over to the area, but the sound stopped and it was gone, I found my way back to a path about an half hour later and made my way down to tell my family, who still don’t believe me...I can say one thing, it sure was a crazy experience that raised the hair on the back of my neck. Very tall It ran in long leaping strides and moved very fast like nothing I had ever seen  However, combined with the event, we thought that a bigfoot could have made off with our fish Then on January 21st, 2008,  on a cloudy evening right before dark (around 6 – 6:30 P.M) my friend’s older brother, who thought we were crazy, seen something big, black, fuzzy, and walking on its hind legs about 200 yards away just directly across the road where I had seen it in September Most of its hair was tangled and matted in spots as if it had wallowed the ground or a tree or something  It first was moving horizontally with the mountain side The Bigfoot blinked twice while looking at me and then stepped back behind the tree..I viewed it for about 20 seconds while it was looking at me..my mind just couldn't figure out what it was and I knew what it wasn't..I had no desire to shoot it and very well could have but my mind and body almost seemed to be in a state of shock while viewing it..I had to cross near the location on the trail out if the woods and I was F'n terrified even with a loaded deer rifle..my hair stood on end when I realized that I would have to go towards the location to get out of the woods..I called my uncle as soon as I got to my jeep and told him..he believed me..I am a VERY honest man and would never lie about this..the thing is though..I never heard it run away or move through the leaves..and you can hear movement from 200+ yards off in these woods..it's like it just disappeared..I came home very shaken from the experience and it changed my life..now I know that it is out there She said to me “ you know there's a Bigfoot over in the strip mine.” I said “No, really?!"" She said that her son saw the foot prints  It had brown hair with streaks of red, and a dark brown face with very dark eyes, but not "" without Soul"" It looked at first that it was on all 4 legs, and as big as the outline was we assumed it was a bear, until it stood up on two legs While listening to this all of the sudden there was a hair raising, blood-curdling SCREAM from just up the hill behind us It was only 20 feet or so from me  I slowly stood up, located the animal and put the glasses to my eyes The hair length and texture reminded me of a horse’s groomed mane, the hair was smoothed and not matted, and my impression was that it was a very tall monkey type animal We looked at it for about 15 seconds then noticed a second pair of eyes this time, The second pair of eyes were orange- red color and seemed to be taller than the first set The hair in general was mostly straight and dark brown in color with reddish tinge on tips This is very common in our deer, even jumped up in the dark Then it seemed to be trying to scare me or get a reaction out of me, the way a deer will stomp its feet at you when it can't wind you It became more and more clear that what ever it was was heavy and big for several times along the way back I heard loud heavy branches breaking and heavy footfalls that I know could not have been a deer or bear (there has not been a bear seen in the area that I was hunting for as long as I can remember nor have I had ever found any sign of one in that area.) Thats a bigfoot Plots are usually known as a bold and totally fearless breed, but not this night I also noticed that two sets of eyes were very close together, and that one of those sets of eyes didn't loose contact with me when they run off On the second night of our 6-day survey, my coworker and I were going to check one of the nets when we heard a very loud whooping howl nearby (within 30 feet of where we were standing) My 1st brother is also 6' tall and over 300 lbs, and the creature he saw was taller and weighed more than he did The larger creature then pushed the smaller one and the smaller one sprang to its feet and rapidly ran off across the hill to my right I could not make out lips because of the hair on its face but I would guess that they were thin lips because the hair did not stick out There is probably about a two thousand feet difference in elevation at where I was at; but it is only a few miles traveling across the Allegheney Mountains It was very hairy More information has surfaced since, a family had spotted something black, tall, walking on the mountain, during the winter while driving their car on the highway, this occured ten years ago I had to be about 8-9 feet tall i felt very frightened, as this window is only about 6 feet from where my childrens beds are My eyes were watering from fear, my body was shaking I had a 30-06 rifle on me yet I didn't feel like I could have shot I was traveling early one morning in January, in snowy conditions, when I spotted a large, upright, dark-colored creature just off Rt.55 Bears don’t have front legs like that, I should know, I’ve seen enough of them fairly close up  and they sure don’t have hands! As I drove by, it looked down at me in my pick up and  I realized just how large it was At first I thought it was a person but there was no facial features I could make out at that distance it was all dark I assumed covered in hair i spoke with someone on the phone from bfro about it and informed him that my father had actually seen a bigfoot here in the past At this time I had read several books on the Bigfoot/Sasquatch mystery and was familure with the creature Dear sirs, On July 04,1987 Saturday evening at about 11: 30  Pm, myself and 2 others had a close-up visual sighting of 2 Bigfoot The hair, several inches long,  hung down from its arms and it’s hands were almost to its knees It had its arm bent above its forehead as if it were shading or hiding its eyes When it got to the left side of the road it turned and looked at me, its eyes were glowing orange in my headlight  He said, “I just saw Bigfoot!”  There had been a snow storm that had just passed through a couple of days before Soon they had to leave, but curiously enough, as they were walking away, one of the men turned and said, ""Y'all watch fer them Bigfoot now!"" in a matter-of-fact kind of way  Whatever was out there, the dog kept his eyes on it  We could only guess that a bigfoot had become offended by the smell of kerosene and covered it up himself  Its legs were not touching together After a few minutes, I found a footprint My friend and I have always thought that Bigfoot was a joke and a myth so we just stood there and watched him vanish over the next ridge, not even thinking to follow him It was about 7-8 miles back before we came to the impassable areas of the road and it was then that we geared up and proceeded on foot No means of startling what I felt had to be Bigfoot He watched the animal from 60 feet away traveling right to left I don't know if what I saw was two bigfoots or something else, but one thing I know is they were things I've never seen before  The creature was a mix of brown, and brown gold fur, longer than deer hair, but not as long as collie fur I live in Craigsville, West Virginia and I've heard stories about bigfoot but never believed them until one morning The next day based on a sapling they estimated the animal to be 9 feet tall."" She said the creature was very tall about 7'-7 1/2' tall and very muscular  Let me start by saying that I was never into and never followed Bigfoot A unidentifiable creature meeting the description of bigfoot has been seen in Capels, West Virginia by several different sources  in the direction that the Bigfoot had walked in was trampled down grasses and broken twigs, as if something very big had moved quickly through the brush It was a really loud, clear, powerful ""yell."" So after we got home my dad was telling my mom about it and she laughed and said maybe it was bigfoot I didn't say a word, I looked at my fiance and he looked at me and said ""What did you just see?"" I said ""Oh my God, I just saw bigfoot."" and he got so excited and was saying ""I saw it too,"" ""I saw bigfoot!"" This thing must have stood 7 to 8 feet tall It was running and it's arms were long and lanky, swinging back and forth as it ran I TOLD HIM TO SLOW DOWN THERE IS A MAN CROSSING THE ROAD AHEAD, WHEN WE GOT CLOSER TO IT I SAID WHAT  IS THAT, HE WAS VERY FRIGHTENED AND SAID IT WAS BIGFOOT It moved very rapidly, kind of between a run and a leap, all on its feet though It was very large, dark hairy appearance, ape like movements, shrugging of the shoulders and sometimes a hop to its step The soil where the footprint was dry, kind of grainy not loamy  It was between 7:00pm - 8:00pm when they saw what they thought to be a black bear walking on its hind legs ""Just after dark the witness, which was 15 at the time, and his friend were getting nightcrawlers to go fishing with The taller one was walking closest to the hillside; the shorter one was closer to the river Keep in mind that our deer are about 3 feet high at the shoulders at best i took my children into my bedroom last night and i laid awake in fear all night.what i keep remembering is the muscles and the bulk in the legs  I told her that I think I just saw a Bigfoot, and I related what I saw It stood very straight and tall and looked directly at my tree stand I was never so scared of anything in my life as I was that night.The thing that over-whelmed me was when I shined the flashlight in its face, the eyes were yellow, the exact same color as a deers eyes at night  When I went to get the pictures developed, I was shocked at the footprints!  They are nothing like I've seen before When we got to the vehicle, we got inside and I shined my light out the window and both sets of eyes were staring at us blinking and showing no fear It was about 7 to  7 1/2' Tall and slightly hunched over swinging it's arms well below it's thigh area, almost to the knees  My brother and His wife saw the creature and they looked at each other over a distance of around 200 feet for about 2 minutes Approaching the end of the bridge I looked in my outside mirror and it turned and stepped off the bridge into what must have been four feet of water which didn’t even come to its waist I always said I did not believe in bigfoot We got to the top of the mountain ridge when the sun was starting to set and while we were talking all 6 of us saw the bigfoot heading down the other side of the ridge. He told us that ther was two upright figures crossed the tracks and come down to the orchard it was too dark to make them out exactly what they were but he did notice that one was taller and had to duck under a branch on the path   Instead, they stayed close to the light, which was a kerosene lantern that lit a circle only a few feet wide It was approximately 9pm, and it was dark and cold Earlier this month I visited my father who I now know is a Bigfoot enthusiast and told him about the sighting She stated that it's eyes were very far apart and sunk deep into it's face I noticed the one set of eyes go vertically several feet, still looking in my direction After we got into the car my cousin, still very petrified, stated that when she was behind the pine trees, something about 5 feet away from her pulled back a branch on one of the trees as if to get a better look at her I cannot possibly explain how frightening this sound was other than to say my body went limp with fear it felt like my legs were jelly  When I pulled the tent flap back to shine the flashlight on whatever was making the noise, I noticed my dog backing up with his tail between his legs, the hair on the nape of his neck sticking straight up growling just barely audible I jumped halfway out of the tree off the ladder, and as I turned around to see what had growled at me (which I thought was a bear) I saw a large black/dark brown head and shoulders quickly duck behind a boulder My guess, height wise, close to nine foot  Now mind you we still thought it was a bear because well you know bears do stand on there hind legs  Its hair, not fur, did not seem to be matted or nasty But the next day we came by this same spot....NO PINE TREES...Whatever they were, one was standing, one was down on its knees, backs toward us, next to a big tree, color was a dark color from dark brown to a lighter brown to tips of blonde  It was tall, probably around 7 feet, and was completely covered in short, coarse-looking black hair except for its face, which was brown  They heard a noise about 30 feet down the creek I went maybe twenty more yards and then it hit me: I had been on that ridge a few days before, I knew where those trees were and if, IF it was a man he had to be around seven to eight feet tall i am about 5 feet tall and this thing was, i am guessing, about 8 feet tall because it towered over the window It's forehead was sloped and the top of its head looked like it had tufts of hair coming into a peak I was within five feet of it and I was maybe going three to five miles per hour as I passed it So I knew this was not any of these and it was standing at least eight foot tall with man like features it had kind of a flat nose its eyes were shaped like an owls and it blinked several times it didn't move the whole time we were walking to the other side of my porch to go up the steps It was walking or sort of trotting on hind legs like a man, but with a movement like an ape It was about 7 feet tall with long arms, like a gorilla It had reddish brown fur-hair  As I have already stated the hair on my body was standing on end and I was extremely afraid (I am 6’ 1”,  220 lbs and don’t scare too easily) He says the arms were six to eight inches wide and the legs were wider, at least eight inches  It was jarring!  At a distance of less than 50 feet, the call of this creature blared though our tent!  WOOOOOOOOOOP, WOOP, WOOP, WOOP!!!  We both about died right there A large 2 legged animal, dark brown in color, stood there like it was looking back at us  I called my brother on the phone and said recognize this?  Played the recording and he said ""Hell yeah, that's what we heard in the woods."" I've done a lot of research on Bigfoot since that trip and I'll be going back there this November, I'll try and do a few calls or knocks and see what happens. When I looked up after putting my hair up, I saw a big, tan-ish brown creature that had a sort of hump in its back There, about maybe 60 yards in front of me were about three or four sets of (Yellow) eyes  When it turned to face us, I could see through its legs  In the mud were 2 distinct footprints, each much larger than any of our shoes They said they found ""footprints"" I jokingly said, “You look like you saw a Bigfoot!” and he jumped to his feet and asked, “Did you see it?” I nodded to him, yes, then he began to tell me what he saw foot size- occurred september 23 , 1997 at 10:30 am- that night we heard loud, piercing screams in the forest and a strange odor- like a cross between a skunk and sweat- I activated my personal alarm, which apparently frightened the creature away-the next morning, we observed more tracks near our campsite- and some broken branches- needless to say I was a little frightened.. The one standing was very large, tall and thick head came to a point There was enough light behind them for me to see arms and legs and what appeared to be a huge upper body on the largest one I don't know if what I saw was a Big Foot, or a figment of my imagination I looked to the island and briefly saw a figure that was roughly 60 yds away, very tall and dark brown or black in color I have since wondered if Bigfoot families could use this form of long distance communications The skies were clear with only a slight chill in the air – for it was right before dark around 6 or 6:30 in the P.M What stuck out his memory the most was the swinging arms and the hair 10-12 inches long hanging down off of the forearms  They figured it to be about 8 - 9 feet tall We talked about what I had experienced, and dawdled over the footprint I could feel my legs starting to shake and I became very hot all over Then, I saw what looked to be a ten foot stump with two eyes watching us After regaining our composure, we let up that hill side as though our feet were not even touching the ground While traveling up a very long dirt road(we were about 6 miles off of the main road at an elavation of approximately 3500 feet) we observed very large footprints in the snow  They said it could not have been a bear walking on its hind legs covering the distance it covered in the short time it covered it It had long hair, what at first looked liked shredded material with clumps in it, hanging all off of its body I called out to the figure and it was about then that ""it"" stood up at the edge of the hill and huffed and grunted! This thing stood about seven feet tall and it looked like a pro basketball player that was covered in a dark brown fur, I couldn't make out it's facial features A few years ago, a third brother and neighbor to these other brothers, was walking in the dark without a light to my 2nd brother's house, and something screamed like a woman at him, and terrified him It stood up on back legs and looked right at us I had never considered the possibility of a bigfoot until reading other peoples stories about hearing that scream and how terrified they were by it did I think that could have been  The ""person"" was from head to toe in a seamless dark color, lighter than black and darker than brown My aunt and my cousin both supposedly saw bigfoot on Spruce Fork Rd in Buckhannon (Upshur Co.), WV.Both claimed that the creatures they have seen were certainly not human, and not like any type of animal they have ever seen When I turned around I saw a seven or eight feet tall creature that was brown, hairy, and kind of lanky Scared, omg, can't believe what I saw, still shook up ! Very dark, that animal was dark, matted hair, from what I could see in my headlights I do not know for sure what it could have been but would not rule out that it could have been a bigfoot.  It then took off up the holler, running on two legs like a man The first sound happened as we were getting up on our feet I think it is very possible that we have a bigfoot or a coloy of bigfoots in our mountains"
Wisconsin,"At that point I picked up my son looked behind me and all I could see was tall grass  Back then my dad had doubts about it as we were traveling with my dad, brother and I and at the time my brother and I thought it was a Bigfoot Dear Bigfoot Crew, I do not watch your show but I did not know who to contact after a squatch sighting I know what a black bear looks like and this was huge and on two feet This thing was big, hairy, and tall, your typical stereotypical sightings He said he became involved searching for Bigfoot in northern California in the 1970s, and he now serves as the society's international director of operations. They looked like huge human footprints, with really big toes The creature ran across the road in three or four long strides then headed south down a small embankment I've seen bears fall from their hind legs to all fours and this wasn't the same falling forward motion  I first assumed they were bear tracks, but given their uniformity (bear have smaller front feet than their rear) I doubt that As we pulled up to an intersection, we had to stop at a stop sign while we were stopped I looked over to the right and noticed a big brown animal about 10 yards away it looked to be about 3 1/2 to 4 feet tall I got the impression from the video that it had long arms and big hands and very muscular legs After seeing the arms and legs of whatever the things were, the tops of the smaller trees started swaying violently back and forth  I could see the arms swing as it walked just as a human would do Standing about 10 feet from us was a large ape like animal Photographs were taken and show that the creature was very heavy, and had an extremly long stride The average stride was 5-61/2 feet, and in some instances much greater I was 3/4 through the swamp and i was nearing a knoll just as i neared it i heared sticks braking and what sounded like foot steps i looked off to my right and saw i tall black figure  On two legs On October 20th 1979 we saw a dark form cross the road as we headed out grouse hunting in Marionette county tall covered head to toe with a medium brown hair except the face area which looked similar to a chimp face  My father in law several years earlier told my husband that he saw a big foot crossing Fischer Rd on his way back to camp  We heard an erie yell, it sounded to me like a bigfoot call  I tried walking in it and turned back after about 5 feet I looked and saw orange colored eyes shine and a jet black figure that stood every bit of 7ft tall He watched as it immediately ""launched"" itself away from him ""arms outstretched"" and a ""blur"" it moved so fast, ""cut into the water at least 10 feet into the river and made a splash"" then disappeared under the water Without the thermal I could only see darkness. We had a tall friend with us so started saying to the person, "" haha Mike very funny!"" gestures of that sort and the person didnt move or speak I did look back but it was far too dark to see anything A height of 4-4.5 feet long  I nearly hit the animal as it came within five feet of the front of my vehicle He didn't know what the animal was, and he did not say that it was a bigfoot I was on my way to the vet and on highway 47 as I came over a hill and Crested the top of the hill I saw a Bigfoot standing on the shoulder it was the only thing in my entire viewing area besides woods on each side it was dark brown in appearance it had two legs and one arm as I saw a profile view it jumped off into the ditch line and went into the woods Its height is only about 6 to 6 1/2 foot, it stays in the shadows, has dark brown hair with blackish streaks almost like what you could call brindle If it was someone messing with us, I don't know where they could have come from or how they could move through the woods in total darkness. As I stepped back to get a better look the rustling""bushes shot twenty feet in the air accompanied by a loud crack thick from back to chest and long arms  Nothing replied but the foot steps stopped  It made the hair stand up on the back of both of our necks All we could see was its upper torso and its eyes color, I can't recall the exact color  The thickness of it's body looking from the side, it's back to it's chest, was about two feet thick He could see something like a muzzle, but he couldn’t see its eyes The Bigfoot, or Sasquatch, is said to inhabit remote regions of the Pacific Northwest, but Mortenson said there also have been a lot of sightings in Florida , Ohio and Maine At this age I had never heard of bigfoot  Creature was sandy brown in color, had short, very clean wavy hair  I jokingly said that maybe it was Bigfoot, having read about it before There have been numerous instances in that area where people have claimed to have seen Bigfoot. The only view I got of it was a profile and it was walking very quickly on 2 legs with arms swaying I even made the comment to my friend that it was Bigfoot  It was just coming daylight and I was doing about 20 miles an hour when I went by but its head was down in between its shoulder blades like and I remember that the legs just looked huge and the top of the head was cone shaped The track line looked like footprints in 10 inches of snow approximately 6' 9"" apart My dimensions are approximate from my viewpoint as the driver 46” high (legs), 46” (long) torso = 92” or 7’6” if standing I was going to remain silent until the driver of the Jeep said, ""Did anyone just see that?"" He had seen the same thing-a brown figure kneel down, like a human, to hide behind the tall bushes The witness to the bigfoot was driving in her vehicle on her way home from work He said it was about has tall as I am (5’10’’) when it was reaching into the bed I was fishing for walleyes on the river  This was a creature that was walking on two feet It had hair colors ranging from dark brown to light brown and very long arms He instinctively looked up at the center mirror and saw a dark figure reaching into the bed of the pickup  Well, my sister and cousin still went outside, and as they were standing by this little trail by the house, they noticed some dark form at the bottom of the hill/trail I could see the width of legs & its body shape only but I was at too far a distance to make out hair or face Expedition and Exploration Society said three tracks found Monday could be from the mysterious -- some say mythical -- ape-like creature known as Bigfoot I immediately thought of what I just saw & my conclusion was a bigfoot I kept moving in a southeast direction, stopping every 50 yards acting like I was digging and rutting around on the ground, keeping my head down and turning looking up with my eyes and not moving my head up  The fur or hair was hard to see do to the distance, the light conditions, and the speed of the car (cruise was set at 65mph) but it was short  I was leaving to go deer hunting and I had just pulled onto the main highway along the river and started to accelerate when I looked down into the river bottoms where there are a lot of tops and trees and general river wash and sitting on a log was a what looked like a very large hairy man all dressed in a shaggy brown fur Hairy and brown, I did not see the head, mainly because it was slumped down on fours, and the fast speed it was moving Nothing there, my friends made a joke about it being a bigfoot and we worked our way back to the car For many years we never told anyone about this incident but with numerous reports similar to ours about bigfoot in the Wisconsin area we have started to tell people about this strange espisode When he didn't return (he did return after the incident) I got out of my car and walked down close to the edge of the woods, maybe about 10 feet or so from the edge of the woods, shortly thereafter I heard something coming from my left just inside the woods edge THIS THING RAN OFF TO THE RIGHT INTO THE ALDER SWAMP ON 2 LEGS HUNCHED OVER LIKE A MAN SLUGGED IN THE GUTS The figure stood about seven feet or so  and on several other occasions following June 1st  made himself known to me by following me as I checked the road for further footprints{none ""castable"" found]   Some  versions of the news story said a deer carcass was stolen from his truck by an alleged bigfoot they were very large with a sizable stride  I soon noticed a 17 1/4 inch human like footprint I have been trying to find information about Bigfoot in Wisconsin, your site has been helpful; it just seems odd to have a sighting in Menomonee Falls It was standing on 2 legs looking into the brush  I can't be sure but I believe it was hair or fur-covered, not clothing I would describe the color of what I saw of the arms and legs to be about a rather dark red to almost black. Dark and silent night, with a bright moon peeking through dense clouds  The eyes seemed to be seven to ten feet high Over, I think, 20 to 25 years ago, a woman in LaCresent was doing her dishes at night and looked up to see  what was a large hairy faced man looking into her window that was over her sink It was silvery white/grey with dark grey roots and grey patches stands 6 feet tall and weighs about 230 lb To this day I truely know I saw a child bigfoot About this time my girl friend ask me what that was walking on the roadway, I told her that it was not walking on the roadway but in the ditch which was about 5 feet below the roadway However, 30 years later my dad swears it was a bigfoot. It was 2:30 in the afternoon when I saw a dark figure walking along a ridge  This looked like the arms and legs of something going from the more open part of the woods, to the more thicker part and was about 40 yards away from my location I then heard some grunting sounds, but couldn't see anything as the visiblilty was about a foot in front of my face My brother, about five years ago witnessed what he swears to be a Bigfoot while driving down Country Club Road in Minocqua, Oneida County, Wisconsin I live in Sussex now, and when I first moved here the local paper had an article about how Bigfoot was seen here in the 1950's As it was very dark and I couldn't make out anything more I assumed it was something like a coon or bear in a tree I would estimate that it was over 8 feet tall, I rolled my window up right away because the animal was just standing there looking at us.As we contiued down the road my mother asked what I thought the animal was It was closer now and was not aware that I new its location, at only about 30 yards I could make out its eyes and the right half of its face If such a thing as Bigfoot exists, and I believe they do, you probably won't find a better place in the US because a lot of it is restricted, no hunting.Check it out it will not disappoint, the place is huge and scary. It was getting dark, so I decided to head back to the truck.I had a small head lamp you can get from Walmart.you had to walk back on the game trail to get to where I parked the truck So she slowed down and it looked around the tree right at her and then poked back into hiding.The witness stated that it was very tall over 6ft tall and had red eyes and a man like face I explained to her that what ever was walking there had to be about 8’ or 9’ feet tall bernard), and my sister and cousin noticed that the house dog was crouched under a chair in our livingroom It was still screaming and shaking the trees for about 200 feet The distance between us was about fifteen feet when I passed by Bigfoot in Wisconsin? That's the possibility under investigation in the Rice Lake area, about 70 miles northeast of Minneapolis-St The deer also had no front legs they were snapped off at the knees  For the record it sounded nothing like the screams on “Finding Bigfoot” It was loud, higher pitched almost like a female scream but there was no strain to it At the time I kept my eyes on him because I thought he was walking on the roadway, as I drove nearer I noticed that he was walking in the ditch It was about 7 ft tall and it was definitely was not a bear The edge growth was so thick on the sides of this overgrown road that the imager could only see in 10-15 feet or so I couldn't believe my eyes it was grey about seven or eight feet tall it was hard to judge the height because of the steepness of the hill As we were canoeing the first day, it got dark My brother-in-law found and tracked in both directions a set of bipedal tracks in the snow I've seen bears in the area before and this shared only 2 features with the bears I've seen, It was hairy, and was large About 10 minutes after that the foot steps started again  I know that this is something on two feet that is not afraid of us but is not human It sounded just like this, but add in some very loud branch breaking and you will be very close to what I heard that night!!!!! I'm 6' 2” tall, and when the “walker” did its loud “guttural growl” when it was right in front of me it sounded like it was at about the height that my head was at We are convinced that this could possibly be a Bigfoot howl It took about 5 strides to cross from forest to forest Asked about the shape, he said: ``It looks like a big foot  Well then it must be an owl because it was at least 8 feet up or so He was walking along the bank on the way back, focusing on his footing as he had chest waders on carried his rod It had a widows peak at the hairline and black eyes I never saw anything this time but I heard some very loud footsteps on the shore(i was in a boat) and branches snapping I watched it for a while, until I accidentally kicked into my bag of cans and garbage It's arms were extremely long as well This was so close to me that it made the hair on my neck bristle instantly While waiting for our order I over heard some locals talking about strange sound, foot prints and broken fencing around their properties occurring the night before I took photos of the footprint and surrounding area (from the AP wire) [Are Big Footprints Bigfoot's? RICE LAKE, WIS My friend claimed they were elk mating calls, but I have heard those before and am pretty sure thats note what these sounded like, this coupled with the loud, heavy footsteps made me think it was a bigfoot  The most striking things were its eyes, they were lightly glowing orange-red the living room window was wide open, and I remember being scared at the strange noises.The grunting noises came by the house and I turned in the chair and saw a large dark upright object pass by Hughes told me that on the morning of March 28th at approximately 5:15  a.m.,he was driving on County Highway H, approximately 11/2 miles from his home, in Clark County, York Township, when he saw a large dark figure up ahead in the road While we never saw anything I really truly believe we had a bigfoot encounter It was looking over its left shoulder and looking me directly in the eyes   I know that the creature walked on two feet and had a long stride  As I was coming down the road I saw a dark figure half in the road crossing into the other lane  He told me that it might be a Bigfoot. It was a year later that my brother found a book on bigfoot that's when we knew what we had encountered that day The road curves a bit, then you go up a small hill, and as I as coming down the small hill near the RR crossing I saw a HUGE, 7-8 foot, 300-400lb, creature walking with its back to me on my side of the road It was bipedal and it was agile  The footsteps were right next to the camper 8’ or 9’ tall and very brawd, running upright up the path toward the woods  I first thought it could be a deer, but deers are light brown and this was a dark brown  At that point we bolted for the cabin, running down the long dark driveway Mortenson, 41, of Sarona, said he started receiving reports about possible Bigfoot activity after a local newspaper story two weeks ago told about his work with the society, based in Doris, Calif  Because of the heavy leaf and pine needles covering the ground we were unable to find any footprints  As we were talking, we all noticed some eyes shining in the trees ahead of us As I approched the sharp corner my head lights locked onto a pair of eyes in the tree about 10 feet off the road, directly in front of me Hughes said that it was covered with fur, even the face area, except for two darker spots that were where the eyes would have been The eyes seemed to be the color of a whitetail deer, no whites only dark It was big hairy and brown I didn't see anything at first but then I saw something fairly tall, I'd say between 6 and 7 foot Whatever it was, it then started shaking and breaking tall birch trees Where upon the top of a birch tree that had been pulled down and shaken fell to the shoulder of the road within a few feet of me After I went by I realized that this was possibly a big foot creature I could hear the brush and its footsteps fading into the distance  After dark we began our first night op at 10pm  Running across the road in front of the car in front of me, in about only two strides, was a large black figure, about seven feet tall, with long arms; humanoid form, thinner body type Additionally, it ran into the woods using its front two arms like an ape These tracks could not have been faked, due to the depth of the tracks and the stride I started off by measuring the distance from the front seat of the extended cab Dodge pickup to the end of the pickup with the tail-gate down, it was 13.5 feet The face was covered in hair as was the body We shined our lights in that direction and we could see a huge black haired creature approx  Keep in mind it is a really dark night and we are set in the woods away from anyone who might be able to hear us if we needed help  It was bipedal, dark and hairy, and tall Then the blip stood up and ran off on two legs, hunched over My friend who was hunting down from me did see it and it was on two legs and appeared apelike to him It was very large man like probably about 6- 6.5 ft tall all i could tell is it had a black color to it  about 10 feet wide with deep water on sides I asked my brother what he saw and he said it was a big, hairy, reddish-brown figure with no neck, nor muzzle - thick, and too tall to be a deer  As the sun came up I could make out dark patches of fur moving through the deadfalls a hundred or so yards in the distance It was about 7-8 feet tall and lanky What we observed was very tall, broad and hairy It does not call it a bigfoot either, but some elements of the story seemed consistent with sasquatch behavior, especially the  Because of the deer element, the BFRO wanted to get a detailed, first-hand account of what Steve K Days later the outline of a bigfoot creature was found on one of the photos Many of the pictures show a wooden 3 foot yardstick lying in comparison to the tracks Didn't happen though, so I drove home in the morning to review the footage that I was sure I got At about 20 feet from the corner a body started to drop down form the tree branch that the eyes were attached to There were other sightings that night from the neighbors, and we came to the conclusion that it must have been a Bigfoot It was about 3 football fields in front of us It appears to be bipedal and walking deeper into the swamp in the muck Large footprint looking tracks in snow Northern Wisconsin: We saw something big, smelly, and brown with long straggly hair and after 20 plus years it's like yesterday We started back towards our car because it was starting to get dark and I heard a loud scream Just after hunting hours on November 16, 2004 I started to gather my gear and got ready to climb down and head to my atv after bowhunting from my treestand when I heard several loud howls followed by a hair raising scream I was riding in my mom's van, at 7:13 pm, as she drove past the recently built storage facility on Eagle Road, I looked out the right window and saw a black or brown (it was really dark outside and I could see it clearly so it had to be brown) human-like shape move around the far corner of the facility, and I didn't see it come around the other end it was dark when She got home at 5:30 p.m. It's very distinct.'' One print showed five toes, he said, and the impressions indicated a creature with a stride of about 4 1/2 feet, typical for the Bigfoot What we found were tracks that walked on two feet had a long stride and had a large footprint He emphatically stated he did not call it a bigfoot Everybody just laughed at me when I told them what I had seen, but the next time I went to that park a week later, no noises, no foot prints, nothing It was late afternoon as we walked south on the trail, in front of us about 50 feet away in the woods, we heard screaming so loud we did not think ten men altogether could have duplicated the sound which did not stop for at least three minutes with no break for breathing I never saw the legs  I flashed my flashlight in its direction and got a reflection from a set of eyes, which weren't the usual color of a reflection for deer, bear, raccoons, or opossums (all animals have a unique color that their eyes reflect at night when flashed with a bright light)  I have listened to over and over again the bipedal walking audio on the BFRO website - http://www.bfro.net/avevid/sierrasounds/911.asp#bipedal  tall, run across the highway The story ran in many newspapers across the country and quickly got the attention of various bigfoot researchers  He said he also caught eye shine and the eyes were large The witness remembers going through her head questioning what it could have been and soon realized it was something, she had never believed in a bigfoot  I would estimate that the place in the field  that I was standing at was about two feet higher than in the woods where the “walker” was at It was easily six ft tall and when it ran into the woods we could tell that the creature had a 45 degree angled back from head to rear end After he told me what he saw, I told him that what I saw was exactly the same color and I’d have described it exactly the same way: Big, hairy, reddish-brown, and hunched over. I would say about a half mile or so after coming around the large curve southwest of Mineral Point, which I believe would be about mile marker 36, I was in the outside lane and I passed a large black figure standing upright on two legs where the grass meets the gravel on the inside shoulder of the median on my left sent a Deputy to check the area out but he did not find any footprints or other evidence It had three-foot wide shoulders and described it as being “stocky” The creature looked like a child covered in hair It was total darkness out there It was dark, with my headlights the only light source  My cousin said it had red (?) eyes La Crosse Wisconsin then turned into a  hot bed of bigfoot hunters I also saw eyes that is all I can recall from the incident, hearts were definetly racing at the time I previously saw two hunters who were wearing 100% blaze orange - this thing was all dark  He estimated it to be about six feet in height and he said he saw it look over its shoulder before it ran into the woods Hughes said that there  is a very large hayfield where he saw this creature and that the ground is very hard sod which would not show footprints But then I saw something I thought was fascinating, in the mud, there were huge footprints in the bog that looked almost human, but were probable twice the size of my own (I wear size 12)  We could hear the crunching of leaves and twigs under it's feet We followed the inline footstep looking prints through a heavily wooded unpopulated area When I saw him he must've been 7-8 feet tall with a ton of hair we were there to fish and i had been the every summer since i was 5.it was about 8:00 pm and i was in my bot fishing close to shore when i heard alot of splashing thinking it was a large muskie in shallow water i used my trollong motor to get closer it was in tall  bull rushes when i was about 10 ft from the spot i started to smell a strong  bad  odor like fish mixed w/ rotton cave smell i stood up and started to cast my lure when it stood up to  apprx  20 ft fom me in knee deep water.i froze it stared at me and stood there .it felt like forever but was probally 15-20 seconds it was about 8-9 ft tall very big with a man like face alot of brown matted hair.it was not a bear i had seen pletty of them in my life.i ran the back of my boat to start the motor and i fell in the boat i think i scared it because it made a hi pitched scream which gave me chills to this day and im 36.i got back to the cabin my mom and dad new somthing was wrong i told  them what happend they tried to tell me it was a bear we went back there the next day but saw nothing when we told the owners of the resort they laughed it of but acted like they knew what i saw.this was in the back part of wabikon lake A couple years ago I sent you a report that my daughter and I heard a very loud series of calls that I thought could have been made by a bigfoot So this thing has the ability to run through the dense brush in total darkness, and watch me in total darkness When I got to the tracks I looked to my left and there about 25 yards away I saw a creature completely covered in dark brown hair I have also seen a wolf up here that was as large as the front of my car 4 feet tall at the back .It was the biggest wolf I have ever seen.  I  took foot castings and gave them to the DNR but never heard back He looked up as a black animal, 3-4 feet tall, on the next bend in the river, about 60-70 feet ahead of him, seemed to do at the same time  It was still very dark and the vegetation too thick to be able to see anything - we could hear, that's it Creature travels otherwise exclusively in the water for which he is perfectly evolved.Think about it ,the wide feet, the up then straght down step, the weight to anchor against current s ,the height to still spot danger and long arms to reach down ,not up! I need to take a moment and explain two details: First, back then at 13 I had the 1980s hair band style hair going on (I had big hair), Sec we didn’t stop to think about the window being seven foot off the ground at that moment The height, color of eyes, and the way the eyes were set on the face, so human like, unlike an animal, and the face it self more flat like a human not pointy like a deer or bear It ran straight up-- stride effortlessly without stumbling or looking side to side just looked straight ahead   But what ever the “walker” was it did not break stride, it just kept right on walking rather loudly away from me going parallel with the edge of the field just inside the woods edge When I shot this footage it was almost pitch black outside Want to die, put on a suite of hair and run around in areas where people are hunting It had a long stride with arms swinging high during its walk a mix of dark and light brown with the sun shining off it"
Wyoming,"A bigfoot was sighted in broad daylight and persons were telling about it at the Health Fair about a month ago in May 2007 Right then coming out the other side was this thing that was running on two feet I looked back at the animal which was 7-8ft tall as best as I could estimate, very broad at the shoulders with legs that appeared long and thin compared to the rest of its body I clearly could see two limbs off the ground that appeared more like arms than legs I'm a cautious observer and realize how your eyes can play tricks ""It wasn’t that tall – it looked like it was like 6 foot, maybe 6' 5"" About 400yds up on a ledge stood something bipedal, the color of a moose, leaning against the remains of a tree It was definitely upright, walking on two legs It took 3 extrodinarily long and fluid strides across the highway (22 ft) and another 3 of 4 shorter strides down the other side of the road actually appearing to catch hold of the metal barrier/railing with one long fingered hairy hand and swinging down under the road into the box culvert or channel bottom completely out of our line of site We walked along the foottrail early morning and about a mile in came upon the fresh carcass of a muskrat right on the trail, which was about 30 feet up from the creek and along the bend of the mountain I couldn't see if it was black or brown, but it didn't seem dark enough to be black The hands were large and long fingered, neither of us could later describe the palms, nails, or other than the backs of the hands which were covered in the same long shaggy dark brown hair as the rest of the creature At any rate, the animal was brown with very long hair I noticed that when it leapt into the woods, the hair swayed to one side from the sudden motion When I mentioned the incident to a friend, who had not heard of the site either, we did a net search on Bigfoot out of curiosity It was so tall that you couldnt help but not see it A hominid creature, perhaps 7 to 7.5 ft in height (we have a 7 foot friend as a reference), massing perhaps 600 to 800 pounds without obvious signs of obesity, standing completely and comfortably upright, came up out of the ditch from the left side of the road right at the edge of the metal barrier above the culvert I notived the arms swung more than a human’s would and it didn’t have elbows cocked  I seen in a snow blizzard a tall hairy man that walked rapidly across the road I don't know what I heard and I'm the type of person that only believes what I see bigfoot ufo etc She said all she remembered was me joking about seeing Bigfoot The creature, covered in dark hair, almost seemed fat  As anyone else can tell you the hair stands up on your neck, you get cold clammy hands, and your stomach flips over, and it seems like an eternity if the creature looks directly at you And I answered ""but it only has 2 feet!"" He did not reply, but started walking back to the trail Two strides that took it from the middle of the eastbound lane, to the middle of the westbound lane, to the gravel on the side of the road...dark...large Somewhere between there and Cody...maybe halfway...and after dark I immediately noticed at on the side of the mountain nearst the top a large triangular patch of snow and walking in large strides a tall 8-9 foot hairy upright Bigfoot-like animal The soles of the feet appeared to be hairless or less covered in hair and very dark in color I saw a dark, bipedal motion moving out of the tunnel of light provided by my van  Over the years there have been reports of bigfoots and they were neither investigated or had anyone interested in really going out and finding the truth We stopped the vehicle within 25 feet of the culvert and watched the final decent of the creature into the darkness of the channel  She took her sister home on a dirt road and then they sighted the hairy big creature in front of their car lights walking on the road The eyes weren't exceptional, just the reflection of gold, like a dog's Right before we left (almost completely dark) I heard a high pitched, eerie squealing noise coming from a few hundred yards up river You just don’t think right off, hey, there’s Bigfoot As it walked across the road in front of us, the buttocks were clearly seen as muscular masses moving under heavy shaggy hair, they obviously attached to long powerful, muscular thighs longer in proportion to a human, big knees that functioned as a human knee, thick mulcular calves and feet in proportion to the rest of the oversized body Apr 20, 2003- A friend and I were carrying in supplies on foot to a bear bait site about 2 miles west of hwy 89 I was a little astonished to see the main page indicating this region as potential Bigfoot country with recent sightings They were definitely hanging down the side, and not down the front as one might expect of a four-legged animal standing on two legs But I looked out my bedroom window and saw walking behind our house in the alley something really big, swinging its arms and seemed silently just striding past   Way back I had a friend who had been driving up in the Uintas on the Utah side who claimed a bigfoot thing walked in front of their truck, stopped and looked at them, them continued on As we approached the figure at a speed of about 45 miles per hour, it looked first at the vehicle (we noticed the yellow reflection from it's eyes that is seen in a dog's eye when light catches it at night) then deliberately turned it's head away from the lights Though there is no way to say at this distance, the specimen appeared to be between 6 and 10 feet in height As we came around a curve in the road our high beams illuminated a large dark shaggy figure coming up out of the ditch on the left side (south)of the road at a distance of about 200 -250 ft This area is restricted to foot or horseback only and is on the Idaho/Wyoming border It was black like a bear and it had long arms and ran Then it made three strides across this rocky terrain and stopped just above a green grassy like area next to the snow The arms hung from heavily muscled shoulders and were longer than a human reaching to knee length and extending fully and almost a horizontal positon to the front and rear of the body as it moved Yet he laughed when I told them we may have seen a Bigfoot, which he readily dismissed It seemed longer than bear hair, and to notice this swaying effect at this distance I would guess that maybe the hair was a foot long or more It also seemed like its arms were slightly long We both got an impression of long hair covering some of it It may have been between 7 to 9 feet tall, but I'm estimating with the size of the lightpost, the trees it disappeared in, things like that It walked on two legs but not exactly like a man...Ive seen moose, deer, elk, steers, skunks, foxes, one little bear, porcupines, you name it, but it wasnt any of these"
