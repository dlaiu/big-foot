75309,Report 75309: Daylight road crossing sighting of a Sasquatch 65mi NE of Valdez,Class A,2022-05-15T12:00:00Z,61.96802,-145.3427,2022,Alaska,75309.0,"This past spring at approximately mile 106 Richardson Hwy, traveling to Princess Hotel for breakfast on a Sunday morning, about 1/4 before the right turn to Princess Hotel a very Large 2 legged CRITTER ran across the road in front of me and my wife. In 3 steps on a dead run was into the ditch and into the timber. Wish the snow would have been on the ground, but ditches weren't mowed yet.  No visible tracks just brush pushed down. Never seen anything afterwards till late summer in August, watching TV late evening I started hearing noises and thought my surround sound was on, muted the tv, randomly heard it, sounds like a wood knock, and frequently I went outside and it was coming from behind the house. I live at mile 109 Richardson, and no neighbors in that direction for quite aways.  It kinda freaked me after. I knew what it was but after that I haven't heard anything since.  I always carry a sidearm when cutting firewood or just out riding. I truly believe we have a Bigfoot in our area"
44487,Report 44487: Memory told of a close dalylight observation outside Alexander City,Class A,2014-03-30T12:00:00Z,32.91874,-85.9793,2014,Alabama,44487.0,"Not a good writer, but what happened to me and a friend  - we were walking down an old pulpwood road with his german shepherd  and got a strong smell like a goat and stopped my friend. I walked ahead about 20 ft and said it might be a big rattle snake, about that time I heard leaves rustling and it got louder and a tree about 6 inches around shook back and forth about 2 feet each way and I heard the leaves moving like something was running away. I pulled some branches back and there it was, about 20 feet running away on 2 legs at a very fast pace. It was about 8 feet tall and I could see its muscles in its legs moving and the whitish skin under the 3 inch black hair. Long arms no neck as plain as day. My friend never saw it and didn't believe me. But it changed my life. Would like for someone to call me. Two weeks later in the dentist was an outdoors magazine with the Patterson film in it."

44986,"Report 44986: Memory told of a close up daylight encounter with two, possibly young, Bigfoots near Abbeville",Class A,2014-12-31T12:00:00Z,31.651,-85.19265,2014,Alabama,44986.0,"When my aunt was about 11 or 12 years old, she was helping her older cousin (Jerry) in the field at her aunt's house in an area called ""Screamer"" in Henry County, Alabama.  It was a hot day, and after some time Jerry grew very thirsty and asked my aunt to walk up the road to the house and get him a glass of water.  My aunt then walked through the field back toward the dirt road leading to her aunt's house.  Upon reaching the dirt road, she saw two creatures standing on the other side of the road.  She stopped and began slowly backing up, then stopped again.  She stood there looking at them, and they looking at her, for a minute or so, long enough for her to get a good look at them.  They were only around 10 feet away from her at that point - she on one side of the dirt road and they on the other.  She described them as standing next to each other.  One was, in her estimation, around 5 feet tall and the other was slightly shorter, around 4 feet tall.  She said that she got the impression that they were young.  She said that they were ""real hairy"" and completely covered in dark brownish black hair, that they looked sort of like gorillas but with human looking faces with hair on them, human looking hands, and human looking feet.  She said their noses were free of hair and that the color of their noses was dark brown or black, as were their feet and hands.  They stood very still other than blinking, just looking at her.  Except for being covered in thick hair, their faces looked human with regular human-looking noses.  After a minute or so, she took off running as fast as she could back up to the house to get the water Jerry had requested.  She did not look back as she ran.  She got the water, and proceeded to walk back toward the field.  The creatures were not there anymore.  She never told anyone about this incident until just a couple of months ago because she was always afraid people would make fun of her."

Dark hairy color and was standing on 2 legs. It stood and stared at me a few seconds and then turned and walked back into the woods. It took 2 strides and it was gone. I was freaked out!!!!

It was very foggy. We were within a couple miles from home when she spotted what she said was a very broad creature that stood on two legs and I became really excited when she said what stuck out to her the most was the figures cone shaped head and the way the hair shined when the lights hit it. I am still angry with myself because I was asleep on the passenger seat. She says the creature had its back to the road and disappeared when we went past it. She franticly explained to me what she saw when we got home and being the Bigfoot enthusiast I am jumped in my car and returned to the spot but didn't see anything.
50178,Report 50178: Recollection of a roadside sighting of a white Bigfoot near Blount Springs,Class A,2014-01-14T12:00:00Z,33.89833,-86.84557,2014,Alabama,50178.0,"I was driving a VW bus so I had a good view of my surroundings. As I rounded the first corner of the exit I noticed what I thought was a big white dog, like an Afghan running on all fours toward the road, up an embankment. We both reached the same point at the same time and I thought I would hit the dog. It seemed it didn't notice my car until it reached the side of the road when it was only feet away from the car. I don't remember slowing much but I wasn't going very fast to start with as the curve was pretty tight. As the creature reached the road and I saw it, it stood up on it's back legs. It was covered with long white hair maybe 8 inches long, it wasn't thick but more stringy and dirty looking and it had a round head, not a dog.  I passed the creature and didn't catch it in my mirrors as it was dark. It scared me.I didn't get much detail of it's face but I did notice a fairly large mouth or lips which were prominent. The head was not huge and the body was pretty slender, it was probably as tall as the VW when it stood up, over 6 feet."
65679,Report 65679: Afternoon sighting of a bigfoot by motorist on Hwy 17 just north of Deer Park,Class A,2020-04-16T12:00:00Z,31.24305,-88.31126,2020,Alabama,65679.0,I was driving home from work in the afternoon and completely preoccupied with thoughts of my struggles. When my eyes caught something. However my mind was still not focused other than I was waiting for movement of sorts. It’s second nature to keep a eye out for deer in this area. When I finally noticed that I was looking at  something unusual.  I saw a tall hairy animal walking off into the woods (on two feet) from the road. It had long blonde to light brown hair all over. I never saw the face. I kept my eyes focused on the woods where it walked into. When I reached that spot I was completely shocked at the size that creature was. It had to be at least 9 - 10 feet tall. The only thing I could think of was Bigfoot. Note: I have never been a believer of Bigfoot before but what I saw that day is something I can’t stop thinking about.
67423,Report 67423: Sighting of a Sasquatch crossing forest road off I-20 near AL/GA state border.,Class A,2020-06-15T12:00:00Z,33.64341,-85.41961,2020,Alabama,67423.0,"Me and my wife and two girls were going to see my parents who live in Cleburne county AL and my daughter who had not long gotten her drivers license was driving and I was up front in the passenger seat and my wife and other daughter was in the back. We had just gotten of the interstate and had turned down the long back road that takes us to my parents . And as we came over a hill and something huge and black darted across the road on two feet and into the woods about 50 yards ahead . My daughter said what was that I was like I have no idea , it was massive and very wide across the shoulders and it’s head seemed to just sit on top of its huge shoulders, like this thing was taller and wider than anything I’ve ever seen and moved with unreal speed . My daughter didn’t really get a good of look at it she just seen something big zip across the road , but I seen it long enough to see it was standing up on two feet and really big and I guess what stands out to me the most is just how wide it’s upper body was  big enough to know that no other animal could even come close especially around here, and it’s height I’m just guessing but it seemed easily 8 feet  . I still can’t believe that something like this actually exist I mean how can something that big not be seen more ,you hear the stories but to see something like this that you can’t explain, and you know most people will not believe you but I guess now I’m a believer"
75577,"Report 75577: Daylight sighting, 2 witnesses, outside Heflin 10 miles from GA border off I-20",Class A,2023-02-09T12:00:00Z,33.65175,-85.52335,2023,Alabama,75577.0,My husband and I heard strange sounds for 2 nights in February 2023 and laughed about how they sounded like the Bigfoot sounds on television shows. The 3rd night at dusk we were on our carport looking into the woods that border our property in Heflin (Cleburne County) Alabama. We saw what looked like Bigfoot peeking around a tree at us. We watched it for approximately 5 minutes as it appeared to look at us from the left then the right [of the tree trunk]. I dismissed it as being a distortion with the trees and wind. I turned to go into the house and looked back and distinctly saw what could only be Bigfoot running away. I yelled for my husband and he also saw it running away. It had our hearts beating wildly and the hair standing up on our arms. There was no mistaking what we saw!
50541,Report 50541: Motorist has a close sighting at dusk on AR-258 outside Bald Knob,Class A,2015-12-28T12:00:00Z,35.34737,-91.60007,2015,Arkansas,50541.0,"Around 5pm I was driving down hwy 258 to go to the store. We have had some recent flooding so I was driving slower than normal and watching for deer. Along the way I seen 2 different area of deer, one had 3 I could see the other there was at least 6. So on the way back from the store I knew to slow down in those areas just in case. In one area it is a rather sharp curve and I had seen the most deer there. As I came up on the curve I slowed down and suddenly something jumped out in front of the car!!! I'll call it a ""he from here out.""  He seem to have been running from the pine tree line and took a, what I would call a leap, out onto the road then he was gone. It was only 1 maybe two steps on the road it's self to clear it! I had slammed on the brakes and just sit there in awe wondering if I really seen what I had.  He was standing on two legs, lots of fur and what I would assume Is at least 8 foot tall. When he jumped in front of the car he was about a car length in front of me. He looked to have had a large fish in his hand. I know how that sounds but I swear it was a long fish. My husband said it may have been a stick but I'm a country girl and I know my fish! His ""fur"" was longer than what bear fur would be and although he was dark brown it had a reddish hue to it, the headlights gave s good look at the color as it leaped across.  There is a lake back behind where he was running from but he also jumped across to the right where those 6 plus deer were standing. We are going back at first light to see if he left foot prints. It's so muddy I'm hoping to see some.  We hear sounds out here almost nightly of what we describe as big foot sounds but I've honestly never thought they was out here. It is just sounds you can't describe, so we call it bigfoot sounds. I've had several friends and family hear them and one of them will not stay outside long out here because she's heard it so much. When I got home my husband came to the door to help bring stuff in and ask what was wrong, I said the deer are out bad and he asked if I hit one, I said no and he asked why was I shaking. I didn't realize my whole body was still shaking! LoL  I started telling him and I had tears rolling down, heart pounding and still shaking so bad. It really shook me up so much.  Not sure what else to say. It was one of the most amazing yet scariest things I've ever seen. I know I will not sleep tonight due to thinking about it and what exactly happened."

It was getting dark when I had a rock thrown over my head which freaked me out so I quickly turned around and lifted my shotgun and light and look up and down the tree line until I came up on a big oak and I saw what looked like a Sasquatch looking at me from behind the oak and it yelled at me with a low grunt and high pitch scream so I jumped and actually took a shot and hit the tree and it took off running back down the line towards a valley.

56735,Report 56735: Motorist has daytime sighting while driving past Joseph T. Robinson military base,Class A,2017-02-10T12:00:00Z,34.85324,-92.25454,2017,Arkansas,56735.0,"I was driving south on Batesville-Pike Rd on my way to work.  There are woods on both sides of this road with a tall chain link fence surrounding the woods on both sides.  The right hand side of the road is part of Camp Robinson.  Just past the fence there is a fire break before the tree line begins.  I had just driven around a sharp curve and due to the curve I was driving pretty slow.  There are lots of deer in this area and I am typically looking to see if any are close by.  There is a small creek bed in the curve with a large culvert running under the road connecting both sides of the street in that area.  Just past the curve I saw a tall, upright, black figure.  It was about 10 yards past the beginning of the treeline.  This creature was walking at an angle through the woods towards the creek.  I saw his right profile and the back of him. It appeared to have arms which were hanging at his side. There are lots of trees in this area so parts of his profile were blocked at times.  All of the leaves are off the trees at this so I had a pretty clear view.  He appeared to be 6-7 feet tall with black hair.  I'm not exactly sure what I saw but I know that it wasn't a deer.  This road has a pretty high amount of traffic in the morning and is highly guarded by Camp Robinson."
62625,Report 62625: Daylight sighting by two hikers at trailhead for Hideout Hollow in Buffalo National River.,Class A,2018-07-22T12:00:00Z,36.042,-93.1545,2018,Arkansas,62625.0,"My son's father and I came over from Oklahoma to the Buffalo National River area. I picked a waterfall out of my waterfall guide book that we were going to go find. We chose Hideout Hollow. When we pulled up to the parking area at the trailhead he turned off the car. Our windows were down because we were both smoking a cigarette. At that time I heard what sounded like if you were in the bathroom and heard your dog sniffing under the door.  I asked him in a whisper “Did you hear that?”  He said “That sounded like heavy machinery off in the distance.”  I let it go because I was just grateful he acknowledged the sound. We started to head down the trail when I realized we left our hiking sticks in the car, so I ran to get them myself. I had a slightly creeped out feeling but didn’t worry about it too much because I could still see him the whole time. Once I got back to him we started down the trail. We were just starting to round the corner that goes to the left when we heard a rustling in the trees to our left. We both stopped started and looked. We saw a huge figure running through the trees. I thought it was a man at first until I realized it was totally covered in hair, medium chocolate brown in color. I remember seeing it’s arms in front of it as if it was moving branches away to protect its face and its hands were black. I whispered “what was that?” He whispered back “I have no idea” I whispered “do you wanna go back?” And he nodded his head yes quickly. The direction it was going, it would’ve crossed the trail just around the curve. We turned around and started walking quickly back towards the car, both of us constantly looking over our shoulder behind us. I started asking questions to make sure we saw the same thing and neither of us forgot. We agreed it was on its hind legs, it was brown, it was a lot bigger than us and it was fast. Suddenly something flew fast over our heads (a rock?) hitting leaves and branches. I turned at looked at my son's dad with a “what the heck?” look on my face and his eyes were huge. We ran the rest of the way to the car. I had never been so scared and I wasn’t sure we would make it back to the car. We did and immediately he began second guessing what we had just seen, suggesting maybe it was a bear, a deer, an elk, etc. I asked him if he’s ever seen a bear run like that on it’s hind legs, or a deer or elk that dark running that smooth, he said no. We went to the Tea Kettle falls area but I was too scared and anxious to get out of the car again, convinced whatever it was could have easily covered ground by then. A Google search once we had service said only black bears live in Arkansas and I’m positive what we saw was brown. I didn’t notice any smells but since we were talking I also didn’t notice if it was quiet or if any birds or bugs were chirping. I know I have no desire to return to the area, I get sick to my stomach any time I think about it."
47536,Report 47536: Evening sighting from a fishing boat on Fools Hollow Lake near Show Low.,Class A,2014-04-22T12:00:00Z,34.285,-110.11,2014,Arizona,47536.0,"On approximately April 22,14 I was at Fools Hollow Lake near Showlow, AZ I was out on the lake around the bend fishing where a storm was starting to roll in from the east as the storm was getting closer I was becoming more uncomfortable so I decided to start heading in. I was heading west when I spotted what I thought was a bear down on all four drinking water from the edge of the lake my approximate coordinates were 34.277763, -110.071018 and when I first spotted the creature its coordinates were 34.277126, -110.072090 off the point at the bend of the lake (the lake is a sideways ""L"" shape. As I got closer to the creature still thinking it was a large black bear I saw it stand up on its two hind legs and look towards me. The creature then turned and walked into the wooded area behind it where I lost sight of it. The small time frame in which I did see the creature walking depicted very similarly to the Patterson video this creature about 7-8' tall longer arm length reaching towards its mid thigh and walking with a very long stride and a hunch. The creature appeared to have a reddish brown color to it a few shades darker than an orangutan. After losing sight of the creature I was unable to catch it in my sight again. With the storm right behind me and lightning all around I did not want to be on the lake in a 12' aluminum boat so I headed back to shore."

It was not running, but walking. It never looked at the hwy. It must have been 7-8 ft tall. It was thick, as in well built !  There was a rock outcropping behind it which made it very visible. There had to be other travelers who saw this also. We got a long look at it.  15-20 seconds. It was west of Houck AZ.

I’m 62 years old and have nothing to gain by reporting this, except the fact that they should be documented and protected at all cost. They are truly one of Gods creations."

63033,Report 63033: 1AM sighting of a Bigfoot on Hwy 199 near Patrick Creek,Class A,2019-03-15T12:00:00Z,41.89288,-123.7879,2019,California,63033.0,"New to the area in July 2005, I had been traveling from Crescent City, CA over the Pass (Hwy 199) weekly to Grants Pass and back and now in the Winter of 2006, it was 2X weekly.  My wife had not joined me and we were separated and I was attending counseling classes in Medford, OR. We had 5 children and I had my son living with me and he was back at home.  He was about 13. This particular night I was delayed on my return from Medford in the evening (usually arriving back in Crescent City around 1215 AM).  It is roughly an hour from the Tunnel to arrive in either Crescent City or Brookings, OR where I live now. I had stopped @ the Bug Station and rested (because I was delayed in my return) sitting with the heater on and engine idling and doors locked.  The little phone booth shack for Inspections there now, was not there yet.  After closing my eyes about 40 minutes, I'm guessing like 1225 AM, I was rested and awake to get going again back to Crescent City. I use my High Beams because it is so dark through there and everyone does because it is like signaling any opposing traffic of your whereabouts (everyone is usually polite to lower them upon the distance closing). I left the Tunnel and traveled down the hill and began the series of 'S' turns through the Pass (it's like a Canyon and runs adjacent to various sections of the Smith River). I was slowing through the 2nd 'S' turn and was watching my headlights and the shadows of the Roadside barriers as they were casting the shadows in the trees along the river. My truck was an older Chevy Dually with a small diesel and it was not a Powerhouse like the newer ones.  I was just cruising with the turns and taking my time.  It had a shell with an 8 foot bed and it was used by a retired couple to tow their trailer so it is kind of slow. The lights are low to the ground and when the high beams are on the go out further and up higher.  You can be seen by anyone else and they can see you from a ways off. As I rounded the turn and was approaching the end of the turn while watching my high beam shadows of the barricade up in the trees, I noticed this BIG Dark Shadow cast in the trees from my lights as I rolled along and my lights lit up a Giant Creature walking along the opposite side, going against traffic- facing away from me.  I said to myself, ""Oh shit!"" and was very excited.  The next part of the turn was coming up right away and I immediately thought to turn around to see it's face.  I knew it was Bigfoot (Sasquatch) and wanted to see his face but, I was too close still to maneuver around and go the other way and the turn was too shallow.  A thousand things went through my mind, ""what does he look like, don't turn around yet, what if he's hostile, he'll beat up my truck, don't turn around here...."" The logging trucks fly through there and my slow diesel would have to do a 3 point turn around or more and possibly get T-boned.  I was excited but, also a bit scared.  This was amazing. I kept telling myself ""Not yet.  Don't turn around here."" I kept looking for spots along the rode to turn around , even a little room, because I really wanted to see it's face.  The mix of it being late, a tight turning canyon, being afraid and also excited - I was bewildered a little..., ""What do I do?"" Almost immediately it was now the small FAST 'S' turns (very narrow) that lead to the Narrow passage (it is extremely tight through there and you can see the Tree hanging off the cliff above the roadway in the daytime..., and, this leads to the Resort @ Patricks Creek Lodge). As I passed I was still shaken up and thought what do you do, no one will believe me. As I passed Little Jones Creek I decided to forget about turning around because 1. I had really seen it 2. It was late and no one would believe me anyhow (I did not have a  regular cell phone- it was a cheap Android and off due to no reception- a real long Start-up time when turned on). So, heres what I saw and why I am documenting it. It was over 8' Tall..., I am 6'2"" and played Basketball since 4th grade even against 7' players in high school (I was a Leaper and could jump really high- I was 6' when I was 12- stopping my growth @ 15 years old @ 6'2"").  I could not accurately guess the weight but well over 4-500 pounds- possibly 600, 700 or even 800. He had no neck with a Pointed-type head buried between his MASSIVE shoulders..., Huge Shoulders.  I was going slow enough through the turn to see his fingers, toes and palms and foot bottoms as he walked but his hair was like a Llama- matted looking but long and, longer and shorter on different parts of his body.  He was Light Grey to Smokey Charcoal Grey with some Black deeper in beneath his hair closer to his body. The hair was long on his calves, forearms, hands and feet so I just saw tips of long fingers.  His feet bottoms were flipping TOUGH (I'll spell it TUFF) because they were Wide and what I would describe as Padded.  He walked swinging his harms down near his knees but above them and up right, not hunched over like an ape..., he was walking but just massive- those Shoulders.  I saw him a good 3 - 4 seconds. His Torso was Longer in proportion to his legs, his leg length of Thigh to Calves was not as long as his upper body- he was Huge. I went to work the next day and told a co-worker who had lived up here for over 20 years and an avid hunter and fisherman and he is also part Cherokee so , I know I could trust him.  He has spent countless hours Elk hunting, and bear hunting. He looked at me kind of silly and sluffed it off so I just shut up..., ""You've only been up here about 8 months and you've already seen Bigfoot?"" I know what I saw. After learning more and now hearing the term Gigantopithecus I looked it up and the Tropical is the one I saw.  Turn the animal around and that is exactly what was 'walking' down the roadway. Here's a link to the picture that convinced me to tell my experience: http://knobbythebigfoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/gigantopithecus_human.jpg I'm going to start looking for him soon.  If they are active @ night then I'm getting Thermal and Night Vision and want to try and get a video of him."

I was driving up to work from Redding. I worked at a school in Whitmore, California, in Shasta County, that was only accessible from a logging road. As I was going up the mountain, I rounded a corner and about 300 feet from me and maybe 400 feet front tintagel lane, a tall hairy creature, dark brown with some gray along the back shoulders, walking on two legs, crossed the road (which is wide enough for 2 cars to pass each other) in about 2 steps and then was in the woods. The hair on the back of my neck instantly stood up, and I was terrified. I had my 11 month old son in the back seat, and I drove to campus as quickly as I could. Several of my co-workers on that campus have had experiences as well."

As we drove down a stretch of road with approx 1/2 miles visibility, we ""both"" saw a creature run from one side of the highway to the other. This creature was tall considering we had been about 4-500 hundred feet away in the car. It effortlessly took a few long strides and cleared the entire width of the road. It was clearly upright on two feet, which at that point both of us looked at each other wide eyed, like we couldn't really register what we've just saw. Once we pulled off to the spot that it had crossed, we both took notice that there was about 5-6 mule deer that seemed to be completely undisturbed or spooked. We both realized that if this was a human, these deer would not have been anywhere close to the commotion. This was my very first and only sighting and I'm absolutely positive what we saw was authentic. The mix of weather and the time of day reduced the hiker and tourist traffic that day, so the thought of someone playing games isn't a viable conclusion to me. My friend is also convinced, since he was raised in New Hampshire and has had similar experiences. Since that day, I've been hooked! My friend and I are extreme outdoorsmen with many years of survival training, so we will be spending a lot more time in the area of our sighting soon. Just FYI, the exact area of our sighting was between Wellington Lake and scraggy mountain ranch. Thanks for taking the time to read this as I'm sure you get a ton of submissions."

We chose a route which would have less people, as I'd hiked the other routes in the park previously.  After hiking uphill along a stream for about an hour, we saw a rocky outcropping and hiked off-trail briefly to check out the view. It was very quiet out with little wind movement.  There were no clouds in the sky and the temperature was in the mid-50s. Time of day was approximately noon MST. We sat in the sun on the outcropping for about 10 minutes very quietly, enjoying the view and the weather.  We looked down below the cliff and noticed a gentleman riding a mountain bike quickly up the path with headphones in.  As we watched, we heard a very low growl which sounded like a startled exhalation - ""Grrrrrrphhhh,"" followed immediately by a very different, higher-pitched ""Whoooooooop.""  The mountain biker seemed to hear nothing, as the headphones must have been too loud.  The two noises came from the same direction, approximately 30-40 yards below us on the outcropping through thick forest.  We were unable to see any animals, but the sounds were very clear and definitely came from the same animal.  The animal definitely sounded startled by the fast-moving biker. My girlfriend's eyes got very wide, and she whispered to me that she had no idea what kind of animal made that noise.  I responded that she'd say I'm crazy, but that only primates make the ""whoop"" noise.  We climbed down from the outcropping a few minutes later and searched for whatever made the noise, but were unable to find anything, nor heard any more sounds.  We definitely did not feel threatened in any way."

We were up in the basin and Helen had gone ahead to the foot of the basin. I was about 100 yds off the three miner log cabin remnants sitting on a rock enjoying peanuts and water when, looking west, I saw a very large brown biped approach the snow wall / cornice and seek to climb it. The biped was unable to climb up over 20 feet, moved back down laterally to its right, and then down to the ground off the snow. It then walked on two legs very briskly to the right, subsequently out of my view. About 4-5 minutes later a hiker with his dog came walking down the trail. And I later saw this brown biped from time to time walking above the snow cornice southbound. Did not see it again. Helen returned to me, we discussed, then walked down to the locked gated prohibiting cars into the basin to talk with the hiker. His name was Robbie, his dog, Dallas. We agreed to scale up the trail to where I had seen the brown biped. Helen took longer, but Robbie and I reached the area, found hand prints in the snow in an arch, one print lower with three big fingers and one thumb. Foot prints were not descriptive of toes, arch heel.  We took Iphone photos and will share if interested. We then traversed to right, north, on difficult terrain. That is quite slanted where the biped moved quickly and easily. No further sighting. This was now about 2:30 pm when Inhad seen the biped about 1:45 pm. Returned back to dirt road and the parking lot by bushwacking through forest."

This was not unusual as there are many deer behind our house. Our back yard consists of a large twenty acre field leading into a wooded area. When I went outside to call the dog in and I saw six or seven deer running like heck like they were being chased, I looked behind them and in the tall grass a large hairy animal was chasing after them running on two legs towering above the grass which was around four feet tall at the time. We see occasional black bears but this was like no bear I had seen before. I am convinced it was a squatch. Then later in the season I was outside at around nine o-clock with a friend we had a small fire going. The coyotes were yipping in the far corner and in the opposite back corner there was a large screech like sound and the coyotes went dead silent."

As I focused in I realized this 8 ft tall creature’s arms, chest and legs were also covered in the same long dirty blonde hair. He was walking north with the back of his hands facing forward, swaying like a gorilla as he walked on two legs. As we passed him I jumped out of my seat and turned around and kept my eyes locked on him as long as I could. My boyfriend asked me why I did that and I told him, “I think just saw a Sasquatch.

We saw a structure in the distance and wanted to know what it was. Found what appeared to be a concrete boat ramp in the middle of the Prairie. We didn't know the name of where we were until till we started to leave. Looking across the prairie towards the campground (which we also didn't know was there) when appeared this large creature at about 100 to 150 yards away. We just stood there not saying a word at first. I remember saying to myself ""look at those shoulders"". It was moving around the edge of the campground right where the grass for the prairie starts. I wear glasses and I had them on so I could see but not as well as the others. I do remember it was just kind of walking in a small area like it was trying to decide what it was going to do and I remember its arms were long just down by its side and swaying. I don't think it saw us. It turned and walked up into the campground and disappeared. We drove over to the camp ground still not knowing it was a campground to look around. The campground was closed so we went around the fence. We went to where we saw it and noticed a footprint in the wet ground. We also noticed spots where it walked through the tall grass. My nephew tried to step out the places it appeared to step but the stride was to wide for him. We didn't see anyone at the campground, and it appeared that no one had been to the campground. On the way in to the prairie and before the sighting we saw an abundance of wildlife which I thought was odd. We saw turkey, deer, panther tracks (which we have a picture of) and on the way out after the sighting we saw a black bear that we took video of. All of these animals except for the bear we saw within a matter of minutes of each other. When we saw the creature we just stood there, didn't reach for cameras. I never even thought to take of picture but we did take pictures of the other animals. Mt sister in law said it was reddish brow in color."
63433,Report 63433: Sighting of a sasquatch next to Interstate 10 near Crestview,Class A,2019-01-21T12:00:00Z,30.71482,-86.63961,2019,Florida,63433.0,"My daughter attends the University of West Florida and I had just finished getting her settled in her dorm room, stocked up on groceries and other essentials. I left in the late morning to head back home which is East of Pensacola some three plus hours. All through the first hour or so there were tremendous rain bands like we are used to here in Florida. As I was traveling on Interstate 10 the trailer trucks would put up a literal fog of water spray so I wasn't going more than 50 mph. As I got out of the last rain band the sky got brighter and brighter to the point where I could get back up to 70 mph. I was still following a car at about 10 car lengths. I checked the rear view and no traffic behind and I remember looking around the car ahead and nothing for some distance. I was just about ready to pass the white car when he put on his brakes and I closed distance to him fairly quickly. I braked also not knowing what was ahead of him - maybe a truck tire carcass and he could swerve into my lane as I pass him. Even though I am driving a p/u truck I ride a motorcycle and sort of drive like I ride, very defensively. As I slowed I noticed some movement off the road, we were both in the right lane. On the other side of the guard rail something caught my eye. We had just come over either a swampy area or a small creek so there was a guard rail over that area. Still there was a gully between the guard rail and the tree line, maybe 20 feet deep. Almost instantly I thought bear but wrong color. Our bear here are jet black and if they stand and you have the rare chance to see that, they aren't very tall. In the next thought I had was man in a gillie suit but wrong again. This was not material. It was hair! Matted down, wet hair. And the height, maybe 8 feet. It was huge. So as I saw it, by this time I was almost stopped, the car ahead directly abeam of the creature and stopped or very slow. What I saw was a living creature, everything articulated perfectly, head, arms, and legs. I had a profile to a back view of it, saw its muscles in the upper back. The color wasn't exactly uniform but varied between shades of chocolate brown. The head looked rounded. I couldn't see ears or a neck but it definitively had a head and looked down before stepping into the gully. At that time I saw arms that moved but really saw the separate legs and saw what was matted hair stuck together from the leg. It stepped down, rounded the gully and out the other side to go into the tree line. Its motion was very smooth, almost like it was gliding. So even if a man could don a suit and act like an eight foot tall living creature, how did he manage to walk down a steep embankment that was grassy and wet? Any human would be on his ass or tumble dangerously down that embankment. Anyway I hurriedly called the wife who laughed at me for a minute or two but then realized I was serious. She said get the license plate of the car (which I didn't) and where are you. I was surprised that I hadn't done all that. Frankly I think I was dazed. Well I know there is someone else that saw this thing. But that is about all. I would estimate this thing weighed about 4-500 pounds, it wasn't fat or barrel chested. It wasn't skinny either like it didn't have enough to eat. It was healthy and athletic in appearance and it sure covered a difficult area in no time. BTW, this Interstate Highway cuts through the Eglin US Air Force Base."

There was illumination coming from the right side of the road from an additional light source other than our car headlights.  This enabled us to clearly see this figure that was on the left side of the road with one arm straight down and the other arm slightly moving.  I believe that arm movement is what caught our attention making us both look to our left CLEARLY allowing us both to view this creature.  It was covered in reddish brown fur from head to toe with a face I can only describe as Ape like. It appeared to be over seven feet tall. He/she seemed to be getting ready to cross the road.

Been going there for years fishing and camping. Not extremely remote but wild and beautiful none the less.Its actually an old home place that has long disappeared, nothing remains except the concrete foundation and a narrow overgrown road that was once the driveway.Was very cold the night before, mid 20s,but the sun was shining bright and it was starting to warm up. I made the relatively short hike down the old road bed to my spot by the river.I dropped my pack against a tree and went down the step embankment to the rivers edge to check out the water and soak up some sunshine to warm up.After a few minutes I heard what I thought was another fisherman or someone up above me where the old foundation was.I thought ""great,so much for peace and quiet, must be hardcore trout fisherman like me to be here in cold weather"". I walked back up the embankment expecting to see people,, what I saw in broad day light, probably 30-40yds directly in front of me was what I can only describe as what appeared to be a fully erect gorilla, except his face didn't protrude out,it was flatter,and the hair was the color of a squirrel, browns, black, silver & a slight tint of red when the sun reflected off him.He was standing there, head slightly tilted back, squinting his eyes,soaking up the sunshine, just as I was.I couldn't comprehend what I was looking at at first. My first thought was ""what am I looking at?"".. Second thought was"" God,look how big he is"". It was incredibly muscular, at least 4ft wide at shoulders, 7-8ft in height,massive animal. The skin was a dark grayish color around the face, head was extremely pointed, like a dunce hat almost, no neck,large pectorals visible under the hair. Eye color was like a shade of amber. It was squinting in the bright sun, soaking up some warmth. He didn't really see me at first I don't think.I did kinda pop up over the embankment, I think he knew I was there but didn't really know where .He could have been trying to smell me. I watched this massive beautiful animal standing there in the bright sun for probably 15-20 seconds.I had a feeling of amazement, wonder & actually privileged .I knew that what I was looking at was truly one of Gods immaculate creations. It was beautiful, big and scary as hell, but beautiful. Hair was clean, looked groomed almost. Very healthy animal. After 15-20 seconds of seeing this I actually stepped up over the embankment all the way in view and I said out loud something like ""hey big boy,ain't you a pretty thing!"" That's when it finally saw me. It dropped its head down & froze. I could tell I surprised it. It wouldn't make eye contact. I could see its whole posture change. It became very shy& acted like it was hoping that as long as it didn't look directly at me I wouldn't see him. It was like a bashful child.I took a few steps toward it and said ""hey big boy"" ,or something to that effect, and that was enough for him. He turned to his left and he was out of there. I could here the limbs & leaves rustling as he made his getaway. He moved like a deer going up the mountain, fast fast. Didn't see him but I could hear him. After probably 5 seconds the rustling stopped and it was totally silent. Then I clearly hear what sounded like someone doing a drum roll with wooden sticks on a wooden table. Three"" brat-tat-tat-tat's,very quick, very clear, definitely not a woodpecker. No doubt in my mind it was him. He had traversed the mountain side and was on the ridgeline above me in no more than 5-10 seconds. Unbelievable. I never felt threatened, never felt afraid. Was a feeling of privilege & respect. I set up camp and stayed at that spot for the night and all the next day but never saw it again. 'spent most of my life in those mountains walking feeder creeks,backpacking, fishing for brook trout.Thought I knew all there was to know.That day changed my life. Made me not only question my sanity & eye sight  (I'm not crazy & have 20/20 vision), but my understanding of the natural world .Ive been back several times but haven't seen him."

I was very close to my home and near Fayetteville GA.  I was with three (3) other grown men and NO we had yet to open any cold beer.  We drove up to our tee box and a friend yelled at me - ""Dave look there's a bigfoot.""  All of us were about forty yards or so from a large black creature walking from left to right up a slight hill.  I watched for just a few seconds and swung the golf cart back up the hill and much closer to the woods & in the direction that the large creature was walking.  Mid December so near 50% of the leaves were OFF the trees / bushes that just several days before would not be able to see through.  Anyway I got closer to the woods and in that general direction of its walking.  Seemingly walking straight at us was a 7 foot or large large black creature.  I asked my buddy sitting beside me if it was walking AT US but he told me to GO to GO to GO as he wanted NO part of what we were watching.  I yelled at it and down it went behind a log or some debris.  It got up after just a few seconds and began to walk AWAY from us.  I kept yelling and it turned as the sun hit it and I saw the left side of its large shoulder and left side of its face.  It appeared to have fur like a beautiful jet black mink coat.  The shoulders and arms were HUGE.  We watched for just a few seconds as it disappeared over the hill going back the way it came into that wooded area.  Deer Hunting season had just begun in GA so it likely was pushed from its normal residence South of Whitewater Creek Golf Club and Fayetteville GA area.  Near Griffen GA a bigfoot was seen by a home owner and a police officer got a good imprint of the large foot print.  (it was near Zubulon GA that is South of Griffen GA)"

We were coming home from visiting family in alabama in February 2020. We were traveling north on highway 11 just after crossing into georgia. It was around 11 PM. We were driving a 2003 toyota sequoia traveling around 55 mph. It came up out of the ditch when I was about 20 or 30 feet away from it. It was on my wife's side of the vehicle (passenger side). As my front bumper reached the point where it was I saw the size of this thing. It stopped on the white line on the road and realized I was about to hit it. It kept coming up out of the ditch as my front fender came by it. At this point the top of its head was about at the roof height of the car. When it was at the mirror on the door its chest was at the window on my wife's door. This thing's chest alone filled the entire window and its arms were straight down. This thing was sucking it in to keep from getting hit. I could not believe it afterwards that my mirror didn't get knocked off. It's arms were were like 5 gallon buckets at the bicep. It was a grayish white color with either tints of brown or black. As we got past it I realized with the height of our sequoia and its chest being in the door window it had to be 8 feet tall or more. I am almost 6 feet tall and my head doesn't come above the sequoia.

The second encounter was 5 months ago I was riding on my four wheeler and I went past a big patch of woods and he just stood there and watched me. The third encounter was 2 months ago I was driving home from work and he was retreating into the woods by a telephone pole. The fourth encounter was about 5 days after the third encounter and the bigfoot was walking through one of our old knocked down barns and I was out on my porch just watching him and he looked at me then he ran off and hurdled a five foot barbwire fence. The last encounter was just about three days ago and he was goin down a trail in our woods
50124,Report 50124: Elk hunter has late afternoon sighting near Spencer,Class A,2015-10-20T12:00:00Z,44.41131,-112.2873,2015,Idaho,50124.0,"Oct 20 6:15 PM Observed 2 big foots walking up the trail that I was hunting on. My father, brother and I were camped at the head of Swampy Draw on Pleasant Valley creek during the cow elk muzzle loader season. Camp location: 16.5 miles N by NW of Dubois Idaho as the crow flies. Camp was at 7,054 ft elevation. General topography is pine covered mountainsides with grassy / mixed alder brush and sage brush valley floors. We had been hunting elk and deer for 5 days and saw lots of deer on the hillside above camp ~ 250 yards away (from range finder) and a few elk. After spending days exploring around the area we decided to hunt the deer right at camp. My father is 83 and walks with a cane so he hunts close to camp. For the evening hunt my father walked up the hill behind camp ~100 yards and my brother positioned himself a few hundred yards along the base of the hillside. I decided to take my atv up swampy draw and sit at the head of it for the evening. That way we would have a fairly large area covered. Swampy Draw has an old logging road right up the middle of it but the access from Pleasant Valley is difficult. I managed to get up the road on my atv leaving camp at 2:30pm as I wanted to be in hunting position early and let the area quiet down way before prime hunting hours. Prior to the evening hunt I explored a skid road that climbed the east side of the draw and hooked north toward camp. The climb disturbed the area so I headed back down to the main logging road then turned up to the head of Swampy Draw and positioned myself for the evening hunt. At 6:15pm I saw 2 figures coming up the trail towards me at approximately 200 yards. I thought it was 2 hunters that were blowing my evening hunt. But as they came into full view I saw that they were black in color. Most hunters in the area have some sort of blaze orange on them or are dressed in camo. These figures were not dressed. They were walking side by side and I suspect they were a male and female pair although the distance was too great to identify sex. I estimate the height of one at approximately 8 foot and the other 7-1/2 foot. I could not see any facial features at my observation distance. My overall impression was that they were incredibly tall and rather slender. As they saw me they turned to my left and disappeared into timbered hill side. As they turned and walked into the timber I saw very long arms, almost to the knees. They swung their arms in fairly long arcs as they walked; much like a human power walker. It was then that I remembered that I had left my 454 Casull pistol in camp and only had the single shot 54 cal muzzle loader with me. A over sight I will never duplicate. The whole sighting took approximately 20 seconds. Since the creatures were between myself and camp with only one way out I waited 10 min for them to hopefully clear the area. I put my rifle across my lap and headed back to camp. Distance to camp was only a bit over a half mile. Half way to camp I came across a road block on the trail in a small creek that had not been there when I came in. The creatures had picked up a large log and placed it in the creek to block my way. As it was getting dark, with a bit of adrenaline and heavy handed throttle I managed to climb my ATV over the smaller end of the tree. The next day I went back to the barricade only to find that during the night the creatures had improved on their efforts and completely blocked the trail with additional logs and stumps. The logs that they placed in the trail were too heavy for 3 men to pick up and I could find no evidence of dragging. They were picked up and carried, an enormous feat. To make the story a bit weirder, my father kept talking about a stick fort that some kids must of made about 200 yards from camp at the base of the hill. My brother said it must have been made by some Boy Scouts. But nobody uses the area. I went and found the stick structure and it was clearly evident that it was not man made. The main structural tree was pulled down in an arc and no 3 men would have the strength to perform the task. Masses of sticks were then woven into the frame to produce a hollow area approximately 6 feet by 12 feet. My father said it looked like it had been recently used. I think that the course of events were as follows. I came up the logging road on my ATV, explored the spur road that climbed the hill toward camp and close above the stick structure. I disturbed the creatures and they built the barricade. Then they came up the road and showed themselves to me as if to say – Hey here we are and you should not be. I never went past the barricade again. I looked very closely for foot prints but could not find any clear prints in the hard gravelly ground. Of note: The evening of the sighting my brother and father counted over 30 deer on the hillside in the area of the structure. After my sighting we saw no more deer during the 4 days we continued hunting. Also during the night I heard my horse trailer tack door open and shut which I thought was odd. I stored the camp food in the tack room and nothing was missing. I know I had the door tightly shut in case of the odd bear wandering into camp. It takes fingers to work the latch and the door was not latched when I found it in the morning. A bit about me: I am 62 years old and have spent a lifetime hunting and fishing in the wilds. Mostly Montana, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Oregon, Alaska and Northern Minnesota. I have had other what I believe were close encounters but this is the only time I have clearly observed the creatures. Seeing is believing, the debate for me is over."

My friend and I go up to his ranch every year or so and just live there for a month. He has a dog that we bring along and like every other dog, he has the occasional need to relieve himself. So it was nighttime and it was my turn to take the dog out so I picked up an old Ruger 10-22 and brought the dog out for him to urinate. I was waiting outside when I saw a dark figure just beyond the tree line. It was massive, easily twice my height, and it just stood there, watching me. I would have taken a shot with my rifle but a tiny .22lr round wouldn't do anything to a creature that size. I just stood there looking back at it, when suddenly it broke out into a stride along the length of the tree line and it silently disappeared into the night. I was frozen in place until the dog tugged on the leash, beckoning me inside. I quickly gathered myself and rushed in through the door. I never saw clearly what was lurking in the darkness but I'm sure that it was Bigfoot."

The next day I ended up going to work with him, later on we decide to go for a walk down an old dirt road that isn't accessed with a key to the gate. We came across what appears to be a large foot print my husband wears a size 12 and this print was a few inches bigger.""i have a photo"". We never seen or heard anything else that day. On September 22nd we decided to go bear hunting on the other side of the mountain, we also had a key for that gate we drove in 11 miles and to the left of me there's and old clear cut but saplings growing and must be at least 10/15 feet tall I see something black and standing tall and moving through these trees. I yell at my husband to stop and this black figure is gone. I cant find it anywhere.we continue driving no luck at all don't even see a deer we decide to turn around and go back in this same exact spot which is now on my husband's side he slams on the brakes and says what the hell is that give me the gun, I hand the gun and lean over him to see what he's looking at its a tall black figure with a head no ears very wide shoulders and couldn't see the bottom part there was a tree in the way he stares back and takes a step to the left behind a tree all this happened within 40 seconds or so he vanishes again. At this point I have tears in my eyes and scared to death my husband was sick to his stomach almost to the point of being sick we were both so confused on what just happened we started driving and about 400 yards up the road on his side again he seen something move at the corner of his eye he looked quickly and these branches on these trees about 7 feet high were moving right in a row like something very tall had just ran through pushing them out of its way. We are positive 100% positive this wasn't a bear or person we're convinced what we seen last night was,  had to of been bigfoot."

Just as I got near it or just about even with the creature it reached out at my car.  It scared me and I accelerated my car to get away from it.  It was a very bright moonlit night and I could tell that it was dark brown or black in color.  It was also tall as it stood above the top of my car.  The car I owned at the time was a Chevy Celebrity Eurosport.  I remember it standing facing east and when I was passing it it turned south and reached out with its right hand.  This was a very scarey experience for a young girl in a car going home all by herself."

44003,Report 44003: Close encounter while fishing remembered near Giant City State Park,Class A,2014-05-14T12:00:00Z,37.63264,-89.17177,2014,Illinois,44003.0,"I had previously written an Email to BFRO and explained my encounter with a sasquatch that we called the big muddy monster at a pond called A-41. Well guess what, I was just watching TV and they just ran a story about the same monster that I had encountered while I was going to Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, Illinois.  I was the bartender at the Midland Inn in Murphysboro, Illinois. This thing was in the wooded area behind where I was fishing. I kept hearing the brush breaking behind me but thought it was squirrels or deer or turkey. Then it started breaking whole trees, snapping them like they were twigs. I started getting very scared as the area I was fishing was miles from my truck or any roads. you had to trek in. Then a huge chunk of rock splashed into the water in front of me, then another. I turned around and it was standing there looking very pissed off that I was there. It immediately let out a scream. I can still imitate this scream. It starts out as a high pitched siren type scream that makes every hair on your body stand up. Then it gets higher pitched and is so loud you cant believe what is happening. With one step this thing could have reached out and twisted my head right off my shoulders. I knew I could not out run it so I just froze. I could not believe what was happening or what I was seeing. This thing was 5 feet wide at the shoulders. I was on the lower side of the hill so I could not get a real good estimate on height but I'm going to say it had to be at least 7 feet high. Nothing but pure muscular athletic bodybuilder outlined upper torso. A couple seconds after it screamed I was trying to think of an escape and turned away from it. It retreated back into the woods so fast that I lost sight of it against the wooded background almost immediately. I grabbed whatever gear I could and started running back down the trail as fast as I could. I don't know what I left there or what I took with me. I ran as far as I could until all I could do was a fast jog all the way back to the car. I was playing rugby for SIU at the time and was in pretty good physical shape. The whole time I was running I was thinking that it could have over took me at any time. There is more to this story. I had been fishing for bass with large shiner minnows for a couple hours. I was hearing something behind me in the brush. I kept fishing, something was stealing my bait off the hook time after time but I could never hook anything. A fat black water moccasin surfaced around the bank so I switched hooks to a #5 treble hook and snagged it. When I set it down on the bank and beat its head in with a stick, That's when all hell broke loose. To me it seemed that the creature was watching me the whole time I was fishing. After I killed the snake and wrapped it around a branch I pinned it to a tree. Right then is when the huge rocks hit the water, trees started snapping and I turned around to the scream. This is a true story. I fished this small lake several times before this happened but have never returned. My memory will never forget this spot on the lake, the snake, the scream, the creature. It has been over twenty years. Story has always been told the same. I told this story to a BFRO rep. about four years ago and I think it was the guy who covers Jackson County, Illinois. I told him about the A41 lake and that he could find what he was looking for right there. He asked me to make a report on the site but I did not. Now after seeing this episode of Monsters and mysteries in America and the guy from the Murphysboro salvage yard describing the scream exactly I knew I had to come forward. This is true and it really does exist."

I didn't see its face, its hair was in the way. It was standing sideways. This happened on a farm south of Rock Falls, Illinois. November-2006. It happened in a cornfield, with a large pine grove, along with brush and some trees. This particular part of the farm was in an area where they dumped their cows and calves, that had died while giving birth.  (its illegal but many do it because it cost a lot of money to dispose) they also dumped the carcasses of the deer from hunting, after they butchered them.  I didn't smell the BF, but I'm pretty sure my German Shepard did.  I was out there to walk her, like many times I had done in the past.  But this time she took off. I tried to call her back, but she had a funny/scared look in her face.  I thought that was strange, but blew it off, and kept walking on a little bit more. That was until I looked up and saw it. I looked at my friend, to say ""hey did you see that"", but he was looking down at the field/ ground. I looked back, and it was gone. I was in shock, trying to rationalize what I had just seen. I was thinking what was a man doing in a Chewbacca suit out here!  Then I realized it was a Bigfoot.  I was too embarrassed to say anything and kept to myself.  I got scared then and asked that we turn around."

It was late July or early August when I saw this animal run in front of my car.  It was dusk when my daughter and I were driving on what is known as Old highway 34 (Illinois Route 164) west of Galesburg, Illinois heading for Monmouth, Illinois. I was right by the Knox / Warren county line. I had just driven over a little bridge that covered a small creek or farm run off.  This bridge was down in a little lower area then the rest of the land and as I came over the bridge and started around a little curve an animal ran in front of my car.  It was about 15 yards in front of my vehicle.  Since it was not quite dark, my headlights did not illuminate the animal well, yet it was still light enough to see the creature.  The creature was very dark and hairy it was running on all fours, yet it was very tall.  Its rear end was up higher than its front end and it appeared to have no muzzle.  Its face was flat. This creature had a most awkward gate for the speed it was actually achieving.  Its front legs moved as if a human would be leaning over a tricycle peddling and its back legs moved with a human running motion including what appeared to be knees. My daughter, unfortunately did not see it and that was very disappointing for her and me. The animal ran so quickly across the road that by the time I was able to say something it was gone.  We turned around to see if we could see it off the side of the road but in Illinois that time of the year it's impossible.  Tall corn, tall grass, soy beans, bushes and trees."

The road had steep banks on both sides and it ran down and across the road and out of sight on the other side of the road very quickly. It went from being on all fours to two legs as it was crossing the road. It was big, brown, hairy and very fast. My mother and I both looked at each other and said ""did you see that"" at the same time. We were scared to turn around but did go back with two other people within about 30 min of the sighting but we didn't see anything else. After we saw this my mom told me that when she was a kid living in New Douglas that there were stories of a ""Crazy Guy"" that lived in the woods in this same area. I can tell you 100% that this wasn't a person or any other animal that I have ever seen."

49954,Report 49954: Memory told of encounter at a remote cabin at Sandy Run,Class A,2015-10-11T12:00:00Z,37.9308,-88.362,2015,Illinois,49954.0,I personally did not have an incident but my Aunt and Grandmother did.   I am not certain the year.  My aunt was a young girl and she is in her late 70's now. My grandparents bought a cabin for a weekend get away.  This cabin was very remote.  It was near Eldorado and the area was called Sandy Run.   There were 4 cabins on a lake surrounded by woods.  Very remote. My aunt and my mother were sleeping in the front room.  My aunt awoken in the middle of the night when she heard the front screen door on the enclosed porch open.  She heard footsteps.  There were 3 front windows and a door looking out onto the porch.   She saw a large man-like figure walk past all three windows and stop at the door.  The figure bent down to look in.  She said it looked like a very large man covered in red hair and had a pointed head.   She was afraid and ran and got into bed with my grandparents.  And never spoke of it until years later. I have been listening to this story (only when I ask her to retell it for many years).  She has never deviated from the story. Ever.  My aunt would not lie to me. As I was a young girl.  My grandmother told me she was at the cabin alone in mid day.  She looked out the back and saw a large ape looking creature on the cliff and descending down the cliff like no human ever would be able to.   She told me that story once and I will never forget her conviction about it.   My grandmother would have no reason to lie to me either.   My grandmother has passed but my aunt is still living. After these stories I have become a major bigfoot enthusiast.  Everyone I know thinks I'm a nut.  But there is no doubt in my mind what my grandmother and aunt saw. I would love to meet other researchers or enthusiasts.

It was still dark out and I had my lights on, the creature was just at the end of where my lights hit. It didn't seem to be extremely tall, but what caught my eye was the huge muscles on its legs and arms. It didn't appear to have much of a neck, like the head was sitting on the shoulders. I could see that it was not wearing any clothes, but also did not see long hair either. I would estimate it to be between 6'-6'5"". It was a dark dirty black/grey color. It disappeared quickly into the cornfield. This all runs extremely close to the river. The area it came from always has multiple deer feeding and crossing the road.  I always drive slow and cautiously on this stretch of road. "

When it hit the road I could see very large legs spread wide in a dead run with large swinging hairy arms. The arms switched back and forth close to the ground as its body was leaning forward. It leaped across the road in two jumps. When it hit the shoulder it looked back at me. I said to myself out loud ""f***ng Bigfoot!"" It was a about 2 seconds before it vanished in the darkness altogether but I could see it clearly. It was very large and even though it was hunched over nearly horizontal it still was close to being wider than my car and nearly to the top of my windshield. It blocked out the lights of the car ahead. It had shinny black hair. I could not see eyes or mouth but saw its head turn towards me before it jumped into the dark field."

44721,Report 44721: Motorist nearly collides with a large white animal at night near McPherson,Class A,2014-03-29T12:00:00Z,38.19744,-97.41755,2014,Kansas,44721.0,"On 3/29/2014 at approximately 9:42 pm (I know this because of cell phone records) my daughter and her friend and I were coming back from a trip to Manhattan, KS on Burmac Road between McPherson and Burrton, KS after the S curve in the road.  I remember seeing the lights of a home in the distance and out of the corner of my eye I saw something white.  When I turned my head the large white animal was running at a high rate of speed towards my car.  It looked like he was going to hit the passenger side of the car.  This animal was gigantic, when it ran into the ditch it still looked taller than my car which is a 2009 Dodge Caliber.  It looked like this white animal was flying through the air at a high rate of speed.  When it hit the ditch we got a great look at the face and the features and its size.  It was really fuzzy, especially in the face and it had dark sunken eyes and a mouth that was not visible and the nose was not distinct.  The most memorable feature was the eyes....they were very black. It was on two legs but when it approached the ditch it used its front hands/paws for leverage.  It seemed extremely muscular and fit. When I first saw it, my daughter and I were talking, she had just said, omg my phone just died....I saw a flash of light and looked and said what the heck is that........?  My daughter said I don't know and she started screaming.  At this point she said she saw three images the first sighting for her he was on all 4 appendages the second time he was on two legs and the last time he was at the window.  We all agree that there was a ton of fur...!  When I thought it was going to hit the car I grabbed the steering wheel and jerked to the left.  The fur was about six plus inches long and had a weird pattern, I only say this because I am a cosmotoligist and hair growth pattern matters.  When I jerked the steering wheel to the left I almost went in the ditch on the left side.  I looked back but it was gone.........nothing was in my rear view mirror.  I instantly called my ex husband and left a voice mail and that was at 9:42pm he called back at 9:45pm and then told him that what we had witnessed 20 years ago I had just seen again only bigger and without the teeth!  He said I was freaking out and he was right! One of the most noticeable things about what we saw was that right after we saw this creature there was a tractor in a field and after Dutch Ave. there was a fire in a tree line.  When I saw the fire in the tree line my first thought was.........now I know why that thing was running.  At this point I really never want to see this thing again!"

One evening after grocery shopping with my wife and brother in Hays, we were on our way home, on the 10 road about two and a quarter miles North of the county line road. My wife couldn't take her eyes off of two red eyes staring at us through some trees off to the West of the road. My brother and I both saw something that could had been either white or light grey walking perpendicular across the road with taking only two steps. After we encountered this, I stopped my vehicle, in the road to only our surprise, on the East side of the road were another set of red eyes looking right at us. The problem is, the eyes we saw were at least 8 to 9 feet off the ground. We don't have bears out here, so we know for certain it could had been no way shape or form a bear."

I work in Overland Park, Kansas and live in Lansing, Kansas.  I have been working a special project and my hours are from 3 PM to Midnight.  I was driving North on K-7 Highway just past Leavenworth Road near Falcon Estates Subdivision when a very large animal darted across the road in front of me running on two feet.  I did not slow down and was only able to see the back end of the animal.  The only thing in my mind right now is the fur pattern that I saw.  The fur looked a little longer than my hair which would make the hair about 2 to 3 inches and a little darker than color tan but a lighter color than the color brown, more of a dirty blond, it had waves in the hair, almost curly in areas.  It was larger and faster than any deer that I have ever seen in the area.  The size could be a large horse or elk.  I am glad that I did not hit it because of its size it would have totaled my car.  I cannot be 100% sure but it could have been a Big Foot.  The tail bone was about even to the middle of my driver’s side window.  I drive a Ford Focus.  I was just amazed by the fur color and texture."

We were on Hwy [24 & 9] going eastbound. I did not get the mile marker. I wasn't thinking about it. Around 9:35 pm I was telling my sister who was driving to be careful about deer running across the road cause we seen a few. Some did not even look at the truck we were in. Most were focused on the corn fields. Anyway when we got by a lake that is in the area, out of the corn field a big buff gorilla looking man hopped out on all fours, jumped from the corn field to my left in front of me and onto the left side of the road. He was on his knuckles. His head was like tucked in and he was big and quick and agile. He took an other jump and cleared the road moving left toward the edge of a cornfield. He stood when he got to the other side of the road. When he stood up my sister said ""What was that?""   I told her that was a bigfoot. I looked to the side. She wanted to stop. I said no sis we don't have a gun and we're women. Who knows what it would do. When he stood up he was at least 1 foot higher than the corn which had to be about 8 feet plus. When he stood up on the side of the road I could only see his outline cause the moon was not that full yet, almost though. I got a scared yet amazed feeling. I had rocks thrown at me before in Colorado but never seen them. To my eyes he was beautiful -- strong, had big legs, like a dark grey feet with black around his ankles and dark dark brown with hues of reddish at the tips of his hair. I could see muscle def in his body. His arms had to be at least 24 inches round or bigger cause he was big not skinny at the waist. Big legs to his ankles and his arms were bigger than most body builders. The only thing that I got out of that experience was when how tall he was. The body gesture was he seen us and I told my sister just leave him be. You know that was one of the most coolest thing I ever saw. He is real and as long it doesn't bug me I wont bug it."

I was sitting on a stool next to a round bail of hay near the tree line. I was near a deer scrape. As I sat watching the tree line to no avail, it began to get too dark to see my fiber optic pins on my bow. So, I began gathering my gear to make my move to my vehicle. My friend was hunting farther up the tree line in the timber. After gathering my belongings there was still enough light to see an opening near a corn patch. As I stood up I saw a figure which I thought was my hunting buddy. I said in a normal voice, ""Did you see anything?"" The figure did not reply. Upon further observation I saw that it was walking in my general direction. It stopped next to a round bail and I realized that the figure was at least 3-4 foot taller than the bail of hay. I began moving toward the tree line as to not silhouette myself. As the figure was closing the distance to 100-125 yards I began to make out body features. The head was kind of high with no visual neck, broad shoulders which tapered down to a slim looking torso. The outline of the body allowed me to see that his arms, shoulders, legs were extremely muscular, like that of a professional athlete. The arms were longer than normal and he walked in silence. As I stood there trying to figure out who or what I was seeing, I never had a sense of fear. I had my iPhone on me but it never dawned on me to make video because I was in what felt like a dream like trance or shock. As I realized what I may be seeing I hastily skirted the tree line to my truck. As I approached my truck the first thing I did was open my palm and slapped the shit out of my tailgate. As, I hit my trucks tailgate I then observed the figure drop down on all fours and in four seconds flat it was gone. It either used the bails as cover or it was the fastest living thing I have ever seen move. After meeting with my buddy he informed me that he shot an arrow at a buck, but it ricochet off of the breast plate. He then informed me that the deer was going to run in my general direction toward the field but the buck stopped in his tracks and looked into the field, then turned around and came running back from the same direction that my buddy just shot at him from."

At approximately 12:50 PM, 1 and a half to 2 miles south of Port Sanilac, MI, we were driving northbound on M-25, and my oldest son (15 yrs), seated next to me in the front, said ""Oh my God"" and stared straight ahead. I was still driving, and asked him what was wrong. He didn't initially answer and his 13 year old brother (seated behind him in the backseat) also asked him what was the matter. He finally spurted out ""I just saw a bigfoot!"". I thought he was joking at first, as he's always been a notable skeptic of my interest in Sasquatch research. But he adamantly insisted he wasn't kidding and described what he saw in the woods on the east side (Lakeside) of the road. He said he saw a large dark figure walking south through the woods. He says it was too a dark in the canopy of the woods to see a face, but the reason he noticed it at all was that it was moving exactly like the figure ""in that old grainy footage that everyone always talks about"" (the Patterson footage). He says the arms were longer than its torso and that he could tell it had fur much in the same way you can tell a dog has fur from a distance, that it wasn't skin that he was seeing. It was definitely walking, not standing still, and it's arms were swinging. He guesses that it was around 100 yards or less away. He estimates that it was around 8 feet tall (he said his impression of it made him feel short. My son is 6' 2""). He says it had very broad shoulders. He was able to watch it for approximately 5 seconds as we traveled in the opposite direction that it was headed. As soon as he told me what he'd seen, I turned around and drove back to the location. Traffic was moderately steady, being a summer Saturday afternoon, so it took a couple minutes to return to the exact spot and then find a safe spot nearby to pull off. We didn't see anything at that point, but I pinned the area on my GPS. The exact coordinates are 43.391164, -82.539186"

He was crossing the road in front of me while I was driving home from my father-in-laws house. Tonight I heard a yelling/screaming when I was outside having a smoke.

There is a recent clear cut on the north side of the road.  I seen a large brown animal sitting on the north side of the road in the grassy area of the ditch. I got within about 120 yds or so from the animal and it stood up and took 3 steps to cross the road heading south into the swampy area on the other side of the road.

62558,Report 62558: Hunter's sighting near gravel pits outside Floodwood,Class A,2019-07-25T12:00:00Z,46.92417,-92.83774,2019,Minnesota,62558.0,"I was deer hunting about 5 miles from floodwood mn on co. rd 8 about a half mile after the blacktop ends just past the powerlines and before the gravel pit. I have hunted this state land for about 10 years with several friends and family over that time and knew everything about this area. On this Tuesday afternoon it was a very calm day almost no wind at all. You could hear every noise in the woods that day. There was not a deer in sight that day. I was going to wait till 5 or so and make my way out of the woods I had to walk through a couple thick cedar swamps on my way back to my car. At about 4:45 a branch snapped, then another. These were not small branches breaking and I could tell whatever it was was coming my way. I got my 308 ready to see what was coming towards me. I have been putting some bait out so I thought it might be a bear by how clumsily it was coming through the swamp. I then saw movement off my left side I got my gun up and tried to get the animal into my scope to identify what it's was. The color was dark brown like a moose and as I tried to get a good look at it through my scope. It stopped about 30 yards away and silence. I looked around my scope at it and I could not identify what it was. It was like a gorilla on two legs very thick and long hair. It must of saw me look around my scope. It was only there for a couple seconds and it let out a super loud howel. A howel like I have never heard anything make before. At that point it turned and went back the way it came from very rapidly. Covering ground through a thick swamp breaking branches as it went. I would estimate it went 100 yards in 10 seconds and then it stopped and howled once again very loud and it started moving again. I could tell it was going away from me to the south west rapidly. My heart was pounding through my chest. I climbed out of my stand and ran to my car about a mile away through that cedar swamp with my safety off and to scared to look back. I got to my car jumped in and tried to explain in my head what just happened. Until that day I was a avid hunter of everything and never thought there was a thing like this out there and now seeing and hearing whatever that was I quit hunting have not been in the woods much since, and never near there at dark."

It was 6-6.5 feet tall walking on two legs crossing a smaller road off to left walking parallel to me driving. It crossed the road ditch to ditch with three steps. I had 3-4 seconds of clear view. I saw very clearly the creatures back and right side of body. I saw grey to brown long hair. Kind of like the coloring of a grey squirrel. The hair was wire like. It was about 2 truck lengths from my van. I laughed and told my husband and my kids I think I just saw Bigfoot haha. I told my husband what I saw stating it must be someone in a suit because I saw it clear as I would look and see a rabbit or a wolf crossing the road. He said that would have to be somebody really crazy since it’s the third day of deer hunting season.
45851,Report 45851: Motorist observes a large biped crossing US-33 at night near Plattsburg,Class A,2014-07-11T12:00:00Z,39.60238,-94.40015,2014,Missouri,45851.0,"As I was traveling South Bound on US 33 approximately 5 miles from US 116 near Plattsburg MO on Friday July 11th 2014 at 11:48 pm, I witnessed a sizable creature cross the roadway from West to East jump the fence in pass into the corn. I was nearing the rounding of a sharp curve in the road which features a gully that empties into a creek, that then empties into an outer portion of the Little Platte River. The area is a mixture of farmland, which is primarily corn or soybean ground, some cow pastures and a mixture of  trees, gully's, and waterways which flow into the river. As I entered the curve my eyes caught a a large shadow as it crossed the road 50 yards in front of me. My initial reaction to this was oh a deer, there are probably more so I hit the brakes a slowed slightly. In the time it took me to blink my eyes and reopen them the shadow had passed completely across the roadway and was at the edge of the ditch, as the distance between us closed and more of the light from the headlights illuminated the shadow. I was able to get a better view of what I was dealing with. What I had thought was a deer was in fact much larger, and upright. As the light caught the side of the creature it made an extremely agile motion which consisted of two steps from the edge of the ditch to the fence line. In the same motion the creature placed its left hand on the top wire of the fence, jumped and cleared the fence with both feet and disappeared into the corn. Description: Height: 7' to 7 1/2' it was very tall Width: Unknown, my view was a complete side profile view Depth: 24""-30"" easy maybe more Hair: shaggy light red/brown. The hair length on the body, at least the portions I was able to see varied, some portions were longer others shorter. Reminds me of how the hair is on my Golden Retriever in a way. The creature was very stout and the weight had to have been 350-400 lbs. possibly more. I did not get a view of the creature's head or face at all, the face was a complete shadow the entire time and even with the light from the headlights there was no eye glow. The feet and legs were all but blocked from view as well either from the lack of light or from the vegetation once it was in the ditch. The portion I got the best view of was the left arm as it braced the top wire of the fence and made its jump over.  The arm was very large and hair covered, the hair appeared to be longer above the elbow than it was below, with the hair on the hand being the shortest."

As I was coming around the gravel road I received a message on my phone. As I opened my phone to check my message I seen a creature walking upright across the road. It stood about 6 to 6 and a half ft tall. I quickly started backing out of my messages trying to access my camera on my phone. At the time I first seen it, I was about 50 yards from it. By time I came to a stop I was within 25 to 30 yards from the creature. When I first seen it, the creature was in the middle of the road in the process of walking straight across the road. It wasn't In a hurry, it calmly walked across the road and stopped about 5 ft. off the road still in sight. I was able to take a picture of it before it walked off into the woods. From the moment I seen it, it never took its eyes off me. I tried to switch my camera over to video but it was too late. It was gone. I was fortunate enough to take the picture I got before it was gone. That is definitely a night I will never forget."

I use the back roads to avoid the freeways.   I came around a curve and a very large creature/person was walking in the road.  As I came around the curb, I slowed down to pass this ""person"" and thought, ""Good Lord this is a big person.""  The creature/person was so tall, That the hands and lower arm were at my passenger side car window.  (I drove a Nissan Cube.)  Since I had slowed down and moved over, I looked back and this creature/person, had crossed the road behind me and was already over a 4 foot fence and moving quickly through the field on the drivers side. The creature/person was very dark in color, even when my lights hit him.  He was all hairy and I thought goodness, that coat is over kill, until I realized it was not a coat, but a hairy creature/person. I think he was walking along the road, because he wouldn't suspect anyone to be on this road at 4:30-4:45 in the morning.  It was still very dark out and the road is pretty much without street lights."

Things happen on a daily basis, like howls, tree knocks and something looming in our woods. Our son used to travel home late at night on his electric bike 2.5 miles from town to home here. He stopped traveling at night (3 am) after something 7 foot tall white and hairy crossed a field next to the road and was gone. It terrified him so much he moved into town permanently and will not live out here. Myself and my husband hear strange howl calls. I hear tree knocks on our back land, and smell a horrible wet dog smell sometimes coming off the hill. I do not trail walk our land anymore nor do I go out at dark. I have chickens disappear from a locked coop and 2 peacocks killed inside a locked 10 foot by 10 foot cage. The 200 acres down the road is where my son seen the one head towards. As a Minister I was hesitant to write this but feel something is out here and in a group. I believe a investigation should be done. My guard dog refuses to be out in the back land area as if frightened of something. I won't even swim in our pool alone. I feel watched and a few times seen something tall in the woods but could not get the nerve to get closer. As we have found deer legs and parts that should not have been killed as we do not hunt our forest animals. Today I heard tree knocks again when I stepped out to feed the barn cats. Nope. I came back in it creeps me out. I almost want to sell our place but it's so beautiful out here. The bluff off the back land is a 100 foot bluff above the Meremac River.  Lots of open spaced land in a deep hollow that is remote and thousands of acres around. Thank You for listening."

We Were heading out early to turkey hunt in Hartsburg Conservation Area. It was about 6:30 am, just getting light. I was driving with my brother in law sitting beside me. About 30 yards in front of us a large being jumped out of the Missouri River onto the road. It was black and wet. My headlights reflected off of the fur. It jumped onto the road and jumped again up to the bluff. It was about 8 foot tall by the trees that were there by the river. We stopped and looked up the bluff to see or hear it moving but, nothing happened. The river level was high. I don't know what could swim in the torrents and drift wood rushing in it. I had never seen a wild animal like it. It moved very animated in it's spring off of the road up the bluff. I will never forget it."
65691,Report 65691: Three incidents in marshy zone outside Charleston next to Mississippi River,Class A,2016-08-01T12:00:00Z,36.9897,-89.25555,2016,Missouri,65691.0,"In the years of 2015-16 I had encounters with a creature in the Mississippi River bottoms at a place called Drinkwater, a flood control pump station on the Mississippi levee system east of Charleston, Missouri. The first encounter consisted of hearing high pitched, long drawn out echoing of the concrete walls of the pump station. The sounds were from far off so I paid them no mind at the time but I did find them to be quite odd. The second encounter happen a few months later as a few friends and I were bowfishing one night. We were down by the lock gate shooting fish when I happened to look up on the levee to our right and noticed something standing on the levee watching us about 200 or so yards off. Even though it was dark, you could see the outline of the figure standing upright in the faint light caused by a semi truck weigh station on the highway that crossed over to Cairo, Illinois. It didn’t stay long but it left an eerie feeling over us at the time, we left shortly afterwards. The third encounter was the most interesting one of all. One of my friends and I were bowfishing again one night at the pump station when we began hearing the high pitched sounds again. My friend, who was holding a spotlight so that I could see to shoot began to go into a panic and started shining the light in the woods to our right which irritated me at the time because I couldn’t see the fish without the light. While trying to calm him down to get the light back to the water something grunted off to our left. At 25 yards or so stood a creature of a height between 8’ and 9’ foot tall covered in dark brown to black hair at the very edge of the tree line in full view of the spotlight. The creature watched us for a little under a minute time with one arm gripping a tree limb the size of my forearm as if he were using it to keep his balance. When the creature departed he let out several loud grunts and at a steady walking pace left the scene while breaking any tree limb in it path, whether it was dead or green. We left after the encounter terrified and what we had just witnessed."
65808,Report 65808: Couple sees a white sasquatch at Settle's Ford Conservation Area.,Class A,2020-07-23T12:00:00Z,38.46156,-94.14297,2020,Missouri,65808.0,"I was going to Settle's Ford conservation area with my girlfriend to look at the stars. We pulled up to a gravel parking lot with fields to the east and a tree line to the west. My girlfriend and I felt uneasy for some reason when we got out of the car, but it had only been our second time there and we didn't bring her dog this time around. I have a pretty powerful little spotlight flashlight with a zoom lens to really get a distant read on eye shine. I decided to do a quick look around with it and almost out it down when I thought i saw something out of place in the field. I don't know why it caught my attention, as I had just skimmed over it with my flashlight before bringing it back around to decipher whether or not I was looking at an animal or a tree. But I noticed it was a little more... white? I shined the light on this thing for no more than 3 seconds before it started moving west. This was 50 yards away, but the first thought that came to my mind was it was a man, and told my girlfriend to immediately get in the car. Once I jumped in I realized that it is nearly 1 am, there are no cars here, and nobody would be in a field dressed in white at the hours. It just doesn't make sense. I then pulled my car around back to the road in it's direction to try and take a closer look, but only 40 feet or so down the gravel road, the fog started to get heavy. Feeling incredibly creeped out, me and my girlfriend high tailed it back home. From the distance in the fog, I could tell it was white, upright, somewhat slender and VERY tall. The head was distinct from the rest of the body and it seemed to move at a little more than casual pace once it realized I could see it standing there. I know this was not a deer because I would see the rest of it's body and I know it wasn't another person because a singular person would be out of there mind to walk out into a field to hang out in the middle of the night. Plus it was way too tall.  I will not be going back to this area."

At approximately 12:30am I was driving south on I95 near exit 2 or 3 just a few miles from the South Carolina border with a tractor trailer approximately 400-500 yards in front of me. I had been following this truck for awhile when it looked like something had either been hit by the truck, kicked up or maybe a deer crossed behind the truck. In quick order, first the right taillight then the reflective material in the middle then the left tail light went dark and came back on. Instantly I cancelled the cruise control, steered my vehicle to straddle the center line thinking I would either have to avoid some debris in the road or avoid a deer that could be standing in the road and leaned towards the windshield to get a better look. As I approached the spot where this happened there was nothing in the road, but standing on the median side of the road was for lack of better understanding a Bigfoot! It was hairy from head to toe and huge. At least 7' tall. As I got closer it took two huge steps and went down the side of the embankment into the median. I was literally no more then 10-15' away from it when passing it. I was able to hit the high beams as it took the second step. This entire scenario played out in probably 10 seconds or so. I can not come up with a reasonable explanation for what I saw. It was not a man, no clothing and hairy plus the stride length was insane. I'm 6' 4"" and no way I could have a stride that long. It was not a bear, it was standing on two legs and had arms and hands. This thing was nearly impossible to see even with the head lights on high beam it was so black. The only reasonable explanation I could come up with it was some nut job in a ghillie suit playing frogger. However the two steps it took were much longer then any man could make."

We were still sitting there watching the overview as a fog was rolling in. It was getting very cold so we got into the car, cranked the car up and started to back up and leave when a very dark large figure ran across the road into the woods. It looked man like.  I turned towards the figure but couldn’t see anything. It was entirely too large to be a black bear and definitely wasn’t an elk. I haven’t seen any at all this weekend. The figure was very black. The hairs on my arm and back of my neck stood up straight I have never in my life been so afraid."

At dusk she saw something very large on 2 feet standing at the edge of our woods. Dogs never barked. When she looked at it it spun around and walked off fast. I thought she was seeing things until today 7/1/2022. I began to walk up our driveway and heard a stick snap in woods and looked to my right and about 30’ I saw a very large being walking away from me down a path in our woods. I stepped back and got one more glance of it. I immediately texted my 17 yr old and said I need to know where you saw what you saw and what it was. She came home and showed me. She said it was behind the basketball net and almost as tall as bottom of the net. She saw it for a few seconds from behind as it walked back quickly into the woods and out of her view. Right after that she heard what she thinks was the sound of it running away deeper into the woods. She described it as dark in color and on two legs. I drew what I saw and she said yes that is what I saw too. Gonna be honest I did not believe they existed until today. I archery hunt our woods all the time and have never seen anything like this.

The creature came out of the reeds and was crouched down looking at me through them. Surprisingly it got out of the reeds from crouched to standing turned around and ran towards the wooded area up a hill and was moving with it's arms brush and tree branches out of the way. It was incredibly fast runner and I got a good look at its coconut shaped head as it ran away. It was light brown/brown. It had incredibly broad shoulders. I went back the same day. The marsh went up to my knees and I could smell a bad odor like garbage. Myself and a friend went back to the sighting. We found a footprint and a hair sample. I could hear wood knocks when my friend James did a call and we also found a large bed of branches and some tree structures. The following month I went back to Claremont and I heard screeching in the woods while I was traveling Rte. 120 on a bicycle.

We stepped out of the jeep as we had to tinkle. When I got back in my car, I noticed someone standing behind the very high brush, 7-8 feet tall at least because I could see its complete head over the bushes. It just stood there watching us. Reddish-brown, orangutan colored hair, covered it's head. It was very human-like and I could tell that it was standing upright. I blinked a million times to try and really focus as much as I could, paying attention to detail. I couldn't make out the face for certain as it was covered in hair. When we started to drive, it immediately took off in the opposite direction as to not confront us. It seemed to be frightened. At this point I said out loud, WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT? Before I could describe what I had seen, my 14 year old son beat me to it. He said mom you mean that reddish brown haired creature behind those bushes?! I couldn't believe it!! I was so glad I wasn't the only one who had seen this thing because it's definitely a shock to the eyes."

This happened near Toms River NJ. Me and my buddy were on our way to a job in Browns Mills and we're traveling down route 70 which is known as the pine barrens. It was sometime between 6/7 am and about 7 deer came shooting out from the right side going left across route 70. I didn't slam on brakes cause it was like 50 feet in front of us but I stopped pretty fast and I kid you not there was a big hairy grey and brown thing that came running right up to about 3 feet from the pavement and it stopped and turned around and ran the other way back into the woods. Since I seen this I started watching that finding Bigfoot show but their videos and pics are always something black. This thing was light grey and brown and it was huge! I mean huge like 8 foot tall and big like fat big. It could not be a guy cause it had like hair all over its face! Like I didn't even see its eyes or lips or nose.  It was like hair for a face. We seen this thing at about 25/35 feet. I know it was real cause my man was like totally in sync with describing it to each other. It was all we talked about the rest of the way to the job. It was like what I was thinking he was saying and vice versa.  This was two months ago and that was it. Hope this helps you!

I was looking to see what the parking situation was there for a future hike so my eyes were on the right side of the road when out of the periphery I saw what I thought was a ground hog on the left. It was very large and I realized that it would have to be a huge ground hog so I looked fully to the left and I saw an approximate 3 to 3.5' tall creature stand up on two legs as I passed by. I did not get a good look at the face and I almost continued but I decided to turn around about 150 yards up on a dirt road that's on the right. I pulled in and turned around and headed back to the location. There is a bend in the road there. It bends around to the right on the way back as I made it past the bend, approximately 30 yards in front of me the creature was still there. It was now fully turned towards me and I could see that it looked like a cross between Curious George and the character Chaka from the land of the lost. It's face and hands as well as the tops of it's feet were hairless and a light tan in color. The fur it was covered with was a golden brown a little darker than a golden retriever, very much like the color of a groundhog. I could not see the nose. Wen I locked eyes with it I could not see whites just big dark brown eyes. It stood there for a second or two when I rounded the bend and then took off running back into the swampy area. It ducked behind a short bush and when I drove past it I could no longer see it. I turned the car around again and when I went by again it was gone. I waited there a bit to see if I could see anything moving in the field. I couldn't so I took off. It was a couple days before I shared the experience with my family and friends. In that period of time I thought for sure someone was going to report a missing kid in a Halloween costume. When the thing took off running it was fast! I would describe it as the fastest kid on the 10-12 baseball team. We had really bad storms that night and my commute was a disaster. It poured all through that area and I thought it was odd that the thing I saw appeared to be dry, at least the fur was. "

My car is damaged from the hood to the rear by this creature and I know it is at the least injured and its DNA may be on my car. The speed limit was 55 and I was not able to stop in time. When I saw the creature, who was carrying a deer, about to step into the roadway I hit the brakes but was only able to slow down minimally before impact. I did not really believe in Bigfoot before last night and I am still shaken up and have not been able to share this story with anyone. I wanted to stop and see if the creature was okay, but I was scared out of my wits to stop and get out of the car. The creature was huge, at least 7.5 feet tall. I've seen drawings and such of Bigfoot, and this creature looked similar, but had white around his hairline, and his fur was dark brown, almost black. I'm shaking writing this and I am in such disbelief that this happened to me. I can't even report the accident to the police, and I don't know what I will tell my insurance company. My car is totaled, the creature crushed my windshield wipers together, broke many pieces of the passenger side and left smears of dirt and blood all over the rear window."

I was still sitting at the base of the tree having not moved location for a half hour when I noticed something walking on two legs approximately 75 yards away. The thing was about 7 feet tall.

It was March, 1982 about 5:00 in the morning. There was a heavy frost on the ground, a full moon, and I could see fairly clearly due to the moonlight. I went to the outside paddock area to feed the replacement dairy heifer and started dumping the grain into the trough attached to the board fence when I heard a low grunt. The kind of grunt that someone makes from being in one position too long as you stand up. When I looked up, this figure was in the process of standing up. It was on the other side of a small creek that ran through the paddock approximately 50 yards away. The figure was standing next to the wooden hay feeder. It stood there for a few seconds then walked towards the other end of the pen closest to the woods. I only saw it for about 5 to 10 seconds but could hear it walking for approximately 30 to 45 seconds. I heard the sounds of footsteps crunching in the frost as it moved to the other end of the pen and then heard the squeaking sound of the fence being pushed down. The cattle were not spooked at all during this encounter and continued to eat. After we were finished milking, I went over to the hay feeder and couldn't find any prints in the ground as the frost was gone. The figure appeared to be approximately 7 feet tall which I estimated was a foot taller than me."

I live in Scio,Harrison Co., Ohio. In the summer of 2011 My friend was staying in a tent in my yard for about 2 months. She said she could hear something big walking toward her tent. Then one night i was in the house on Facebook around 2 am and my girlfriend was on her laptop in her tent on Facebook. She messaged me to come outside right away that something was sniffing loudly and breathing heavy walking around her tent. I walked outside thinking she just was freaking herself out thinking she was hearing things. I kind of laughed it off, open the door and yelled if she was ok. She yelled for me to come to the tent so I grabbed a flashlight and walked down. I didn't see anything. If there was something there it ran away. I told her it was a deer. She was not convinced. In the summer of 2012 both of my daughters, 16 and 17, came in the house after taking our dog out around 11 pm shaken and scared saying they seen something really big once standing by our tree in the back yard which leads to the woods. Then again walking to the house up the driveway around midnight came in scared and said they had seen the same thing walking around our pool then walked into the woods. I never really believed them. I tried to convince them that there was nothing there, that it was there imagination because they overheard my friend talking who camped in my yard. I told them the dog would bark and growl if something was out there. Then on Nov.27th, 2012 around 11:45 pm I took our 5 month old pup outside to go do his thing. I walked out the door turned right with the pup on a leash toward the wood line maybe 20 or 30ft. from the door. As i started to get closer, maybe 3 feet away, I heard something big shuffling in the briers. I turned thinking it was a deer. When i turned around it stood straight up. It was very big, very tall, very wide. My guess would be at least 7' tall. Very broad chest which was all I could see besides the outline of its body. It was very dark and it blended right in with the darkness except the chest or stomach, not sure which, it happened so fast. As it stood up that part of it was light it showed in the moon light. I screamed very loudly and ran to the house dragging the pup behind me which I don't believe the pup even realized it was there. It scared me so badly I was shaking and crying. My husband and 21 yr old son, who also did not believe the stories from my daughters, and my friend, went outside with a small flashlight and a knife for protection to try to find out what it was. My son said it was still out there and that it was behind the tires wing. He seen its shadow and it ran from him toward the spring on the hillside which is nothing but briers. He said he couldn't see it after that but it was there because it quit running but he couldn't see it or hear it. He had this eerie feeling it was staring right at him. They both came back inside my son had the same description as me very very tall, very, very wide but he only seen the back of it as ran up the hill into the briers. My husband thinks it was curious, whatever it was, because it snooped around but ran away.  I truly believe that it was a bigfoot. It was hanging around for over a year that we know of."

In 2010 was when I had my first experience with something very large. Unfortunately, I couldn't make out what it was, but it had chased me several feet before I got into the cabin. In 2011, I had my first sighting of a creature that was about 8 or 9 feet tall, with brownish black hair that contained some grey and red streaks. It had been raining earlier that day and it appeared to have long stringy hair, deep set eyes, and very broad shoulders. Then in 2012, when my daughter was painting the benches at the fire pit in the far corner of our property she came running onto the porch white as a ghost. My husband asked her if she saw a snake and she replied she thinks she seen what I had seen a year earlier. She explained it as a reddish color beast of some sort. On May 23, 2014, our four year old grandson was spending the night. We were outside earlier letting the grand kids light their sparklers when the four year old said he seen something. We went back into the cabin and started watching television. A little later he said to his pap and then myself while we were watching television, ""did you hear that growl?"" ...we replied no and he ran to the back of the couch to look outside our large picture window. A few moments later he replied there's a gorilla outside and then started describing the same thing I had seen. His mother and I have never mentioned anything about our experience in front of the children before because we didn't want to scare them. His older brother was so afraid of his description that he made us close all the blinds and lock all the doors. The next day, we asked him if he remembered anything from the night before and he replied, ""you mean the gorilla."" We asked him to show us where he had seen it. Once he showed us the spot, fear instantly came over me to know it was just a few feet from the window. I called my parents because they are the property owners and they went out and bought two game cameras to put on the trees.  Since then, a three to four feet section of our firewood that is stacked around the fire pit was pushed inward. Considering it was pushed from the woods inward and there's about a four foot drop behind the woodpile it was quite concerning to us. Finally, on May 25th, our granddaughter went out with us to sit on the porch and cried out dog... dog and looked overcome with fear. My husband grabbed the flashlight and saw something take off running. He then ran around the cabin to see what it was and it had already crossed over the bank at the property line. All he could see was two red glowing eyes."

While hunting with my friend out of a double tree stand my friend and I was waiting for our dad's to drive out the woods to us. At the same time a friend of ours was coming from around the opposite side of the hill. When he got to us we started to talk while waiting for our dad's to come through the woods. While we were talking we heard a very loud powerful scream come from the woods across the field from us. We had no idea what this could have been. Out of the three of us that witnessed this none of us had heard anything like that or wanted to go investigate what it was. We were scared even being armed with shotguns. Later we heard the ohio bigfoot recording howls and we agreed that it sounded identical. So we believe that we heard bigfoot years later. The second incident happened in the fall of 2002. My best friend and I were working on his wife's car and needed parts and it was getting late close to closing time for the parts store. So we took the back road to save time. While going down the road we came around a turn near the old coal mine scales and the headlights hit a bigfoot standing on the shoulder of the road. I slammed on the brakes and slide past it on the gravel road. I put the truck in reverse and looked at my friend and said did you see that? He looked at me wide eyed and said yes please keep going. I put the truck back in drive and drove off. We were quite shook up from the experience.

It was on or about September 4, 2010. It was approximately 9 AM and we were clearing our four wheeler trails. The birds were chirping, squirrels were jumping, and wildlife was moving around. Suddenly, we noticed that all woodland sounds had stopped. It was very odd to us, so much so that we both stopped what we were doing and stood motionless. As we looked around, we saw a tall dark figure approximately 50 yards away standing behind a large tree. It was approximately 8' tall, with hair covering its body. It was standing upright and was looking out from around the tree. At first, we could only see about 1/2 of its face and part of its shoulder and left arm. We were both armed with pistols, which we quickly had in our hands. The stare down lasted approximately 30-45 seconds. I asked my cousin in a low voice... ""are you seeing what I'm seeing?"" He replied yes in a somewhat shaky voice. I said ""what is it?"" He said ""you know what it is"". We both knew it was a Bigfoot. A few seconds later it ran perpendicular to us. We got glimpses of it crashing through the thick brush as it was moving small trees out of its way. It ran completely upright. We saw it running for approximately 50-60 yards before it disappeared into the swamp. Even though the hair was standing up on the back of our necks, we slowly walked over to where it crashed through the woods. The small saplings it ran through were completely broken and bent over. We could not wait to get out of the woods so we fled the area. We did not see it again that hunting season, but made sure we were always well armed, even during bow season."

As I pointed it out to my wife we were probably about a quarter mile from it. As we watched while approaching it, its arms were long and swaying as it walked across the road in long strides. We watched it non-stop as we got closer to where it had just crossed the road. When we got to where it crossed the road, there was a guard rail and beyond the guard rail was a drastic slope into a heavily wooded area. We stopped and looked around but did not see anything around. It was hard to believe what we had seen, we were totally in awe and just could not explain nothing else to what it was except a BIGFOOT!"
60924,Report 60924: Homeowner across the street from East Fork State Park (30mi SE of Cincinnati) describes possible encounter at night,Class A,2018-04-21T12:00:00Z,38.99484,-84.10731,2018,Ohio,60924.0,"One night this past Spring at about 10:00 PM, when it was warm enough to be outside at night without a coat and with just  shorts and a t-shirt on, and when the leaves on the trees were budding but not fully grown-in, our Border Collie/Australian Shepherd was out near the front of our property which is just across the street from the East Fork State Park woods, barking his head off. Often, even at night, I will just ignore him because he barks at every little thing.  But this bark definitely sounded like he was saying there’s something HERE and I want to let the whole world know.  I was in an outbuilding, went inside, and grabbed my high-powered flashlight.  When I came back out our dog was still barking loudly and remained laser-focused as he stared at something in the woods across the street. I shone my light between some trees, and bam, got some bright eyeshine right back – not the red eyeshine you so often read about, but bluish-white, I think.  Now, at no point did I have my glasses on which I use for driving at night, but, here’s my point – the eyeshine was at a height that I guessed to be about ten to twelve feet up.  The eyes stayed fixed on me at that point, blinking – sometimes both eyes at once, sometimes one eye then quickly the other.  My wife came out and said “Oh, it’s just an owl,” but I wasn’t convinced.  My voice was trembling a bit because I’ve read the other stories on this website about sasquaches living in the area, especially the one pertaining to the bigfoot standing along the entrance road to the park being only about two miles from our little property below the lake. Besides, I thought, “Why would my 11 year old dog be going crazy over an owl perched on a branch fifty feet away from our fence?  How would he even hear an owl gliding so silently onto a branch in the woods at night?”  It’s also hard for me to believe that he would have happened to see an owl gliding onto a branch at night, but . . . maybe.  It just seems far-fetched.   Well, at that point I went inside and grabbed my b.b. gun.  Probably not the best idea, as I do not yet own a handgun or other weapon that could actually provide some protection if things went south. So, I went to our front door, opened it a crack, held the flashlight in my teeth, kept a fire extinguisher next to me just in case it came rushing out of the woods at me – at least I could try to fill its face with something it would definitely not like to be breathing in – and aimed my b.b. rifle at the eyes still shining back at me.  I pulled the trigger and waited.  About 1 to 2 seconds later (I don’t think I hit it), whatever it was clearly reacted to the b.b. which must have passed nearby.  Then, for about 2 and a half seconds I heard it start to crash through the woods from right to left, with left being in the direction of our mailbox,  driveway, and the road we take to access our street  . . . then silence.  However, what interested me was that our dog was still super-focused and barking, no different, but even after the crashing went quiet, he continued to track something to the left, barking as furiously as ever.  So, if my location was the apex of a triangle, and the creature was at the farthest point away, and its movement to the left represents the base of the triangle, my dog had to run full speed to keep up with it even though my dog’s trajectory would have represented a shorter “base” distance of a smaller triangle.  In other words, kind of like when in a marching band the people on the outside fringe of a circular-moving formation have to march at double- or triple-time to keep up with the people who are barely shuffling their feet at the center of the circle, the creature was moving so fast that my dog still had to run full-out to keep up with it.  I’d say my dog ran about thirty or forty feet to my left in about four seconds, which means that the creature ran about 100 to 150 feet in that time . . . through somewhat dense woods (which is where I always harvest kindling for our Buck Stove, and I can tell you, this section of woods are not impassable by any means, but there is still plenty of undergrowth to have to push your way through). My dog’s gaze then remained focused as he continued to bark at a location in the woods across the street about 15 feet to the left of my driveway, so, I presume that that’s where the creature probably took a turn and headed back deeper into the woods. Lastly, I have been doing a lot of projects in my yard out front all Summer long.  I can tell you that whenever my dog would be outside with me, about 85% of the time I observed him to be staring at that location 15 feet to the left of our driveway.  And, even though our neighbors and their dogs and other activity around our property would and still do capture his attention very easily, when the distraction goes away, my dog still very often will return to his spot and continue his vigil.  In the 20 months that we have lived here, I have never seen him keeping such diligent watch on the woods in general and certainly not on one location in particular until after this incident. Since that incident there have been times when I have called him in at night and I’ve found him lying down in an alert position and, in the dark, be staring at that same spot, as if waiting to see the creature reappear.  I just can’t imagine an owl or a coyote or a deer having made that initial crashing noise and then going silent like that.  I also just can’t imagine my dog keeping such diligent watch over the woods for weeks and months afterwards in response to a mere owl, deer, or even a coyote.  Besides, no coyote’s or deer’s eyes are going to shine back at me ten or more feet up in the air. I am about 95% sure that I shone my light into the eyes of a sasquatch that night – and a big one, too.  Though I wish I’d thought to go look for tracks the next day after work, two things got in my way:  busyness, and fear.  I’m sure the creature was long gone 24 hours later, but I couldn’t help but wonder if a sasquatch remembers someone firing a b.b. gun at him or not. _________________________________________________ UPDATE: On the night of 10/1/17, around 9:30 PM, I was in an outbuilding on our property (see BFRO report #60924 for a separate report from our property regarding a Class A sighting from the spring AFTER the event described here) with the windows closed and I suddenly heard this strange, loud vocalization coming from the East Fork State Park woods across the street. I would describe them as ""Aroot"" type howls that would also remind you of a bark rather than a moaning howl, and only lasting a second or two in length. Many were cut short and lasted less than a second, with various lengths of pauses in between. Honestly, I now find them hard to classify - hopefully they're attached to this report and you can listen yourself. I have believed the evidence for Bigfoot to be overwhelming for a long time, so my first thought was, ""Is that a Sasquatch?"" Immediately I felt a small surge of both fear and excitement. I remember it was also a perfectly still night to begin with, perfect for making a recording with no interference from wind blowing across the microphone. I proceeded to go into the house and opened the front door to listen, as the front door is closer to the woods and, I'm guessing, about 250 - 300 feet from where the sound was emanating from just within the treeline, I guessed. My first, front door recording is 2:15 in length. I then moved to my office located on the other end of the house which would have been only a little closer to the sound, opened the window, and took a second recording that is 2:10 in length. From my office window I kept my eyes on a circular patch of light coming from a light perched atop a pole closest to the sound, fully expecting to see a Sasquatch stepping from the woods into the light, but that never happened. These same sounds went on for a full 70-75 minutes, around which time the police came in response to our concern that it might be a rabid dog needing to be put down. If we hadn't called, who knows how long the creature would have continued. When the police came they cruised around, a total of 2 cars, I believe, at which time the sounds stopped. The police never did call me to let me know they'd taken hold of a sick or injured canine. Also, our own dog, whom we'd allow to roam the house at night, seemed oddly quiet, not even growling and not reacting like he normally would when they clearly hear another dog making a commotion nearby. Our dog, after all, was in the habit of growling and barking through the fence at our neighbor's dogs on a regular basis, and also at hikers and horseback riders traveling along the road between our house and the woods. The last thing I thought was odd, in addition to the loudness of the vocalizations at a distance of 250-300 feet, was how - if it was a dog - the dog never, in 75 minutes, came towards a house to seek help from a human. Honestly, when I listened to these again, I thought, ""Dang, that creature sounds like it's on the other side of my open window just 20'-30' away from me!"" By comparison, my (healthy) dog was barking today from a distance of about 75' from me and I felt like his volume at 250'-300' would have been, oh, maybe just 25% of what one hears in these recordings. Though my wife and I chalked these odd sounds up as coming from a sick or lost dog at the time, when I found these recordings again the other day, I now find myself to be thinking, with fresh ears, that these sounds were also (besides the volume issue just discussed) too controlled in cadence and tone to be a dog, especially a sick or injured dog. I now wish I'd looked for tracks the next day despite our sick dog theory, just to verify. Whoever investigates this, please be sure to get a copy of both recordings from me. Thank you."

While we were outside, he seen something that scared him so bad that he drug me to the house. He acted as if I couldn't get the door open fast enough. When we got in and I got the door shut, he turned quickly and stared at the door as if whatever it was, was going to come through that door and get us. He is an Irish Wolfhound and he was very shaken. So, after I took my son to school that morning, I decided to look for tracks in the snow to see if I could find out what it was that scared him. This is when I found some unusual tracks, lots of them, like the ones we had seen on our property a year ago. So I took video, and a couple of still shots. And then I called Jim Thompson to come and look at them. "

It was completely dark outside by this time. We were going around 60mph. My husband was on high alert for deer. We were just talking to each other when we approached the right hand turn off to Wyandotte Rd. My husband fell silent. He saw a very large, very tall, bipedal creature running toward the road from the left hand side. Within a split second I also saw this creature as it continued approaching the road at a full run. It entered into the peripheral of our headlights and came within 2-3 feet of the driver side window. Comparing the creature to our truck, it had to have been nearly 8 feet tall, as it was slightly slouched while running and was a head taller than our truck. It had blondish red fur and domed shoulder/head area.  Since we were going around 60 mph as all of this happened, it ended up barely missing our truck and crossing the road behind us. We didn’t speak for 15-20 seconds until my husband finally said “What was that?!” We immediately turned around and traveled down Wyandotte Rd, in the direction it went behind us, but did not see or hear anything. We also used a spotlight from the truck to look along the road on both sides where we initially saw it but did not see any disturbance. The next morning we stopped at the exact spot again and looked for anything on the ground in the area but did not see anything."

It was located in Logan Ohio part of Hocking Hills area. Everything was normal till Friday. We all started smelling a nasty smell couldn't figure out where it was coming from. Didn't smell it in the cabin just outside. Late Friday night after midnight 2 people were on the deck and everyone else went to bed. They started hearing loud noises like branches breaking and felt like they were being watched. Sometimes it sounded like something was being thrown they thought it was one of us pranking them. Then came a loud bang near them so they ran in the cabin from the upper deck. The one guy came into my room and told me what was going on. So me and another girl went down to the kitchen area and we all started looking out the windows. I turned all the lights out. Within minutes the one girl yelled there it is. I went to the kitchen window and in the field right in front of me there stood a large black figure walking on two feet towards the cabin. We all started yelling what is that. It then all of a sudden turned and went back into the woods it came out of like it heard us. We then got everyone up we all went out on the deck and heard weird howling sounds that none of us have heard before. And loud noises like branches breaking. Then we heard the loud sounds in front of the cabin to the left. We all moved to the front and heard walking and branches breaking and seeing something moving around. That is where a footprint was found.
67875,Report 67875: Sighting by dog walker and more recent incident on Stone Church Trail (Wayne NF) NW of Shawnee,Class A,2020-02-15T12:00:00Z,39.63255,-82.26463,2020,Ohio,67875.0,"My husband and I have been hiking a local trail system in our area nearly every day since we got our dog in 2013. Over the years we have experienced several instances of wood knocking and did not think much of it in all honesty. More recently we have stumbled upon small trees (4-5 inches in diameter) that were twisted/broken in ways that a human could not achieve (in our opinion). All these instances combined over the years have not really made us feel unsettled or afraid, nor did we think it was anything too worthy of note; however, our most recent experience, which occurred over a period of a few days in September 2020, was unexplainable and I cannot go without reporting this any longer, as it has truly been bothering me since it occurred.  In September 2020, my husband and I were on an evening hike (approximately 4:30-5:00 pm) at the Stone Church Horse Trail System, which is a part of the Wayne National Forest in Shawnee, Ohio (Perry County) when heard what we can only describe as a “howling/roaring” sound. The noise occurred twice, and there was approximately a minute of silence between the two “howls/roars”. Sadly, I was unable to get my phone out quickly enough to record the instance, as it all happened so fast. My husband and I have never heard anything like it before. I was a bit unnerved by the sound and we quickly left the area and headed back home. We spent that night looking up the calls of animals native to Ohio, but none of the sounds we listened to even remotely resembled the sound that we heard that evening. A couple of days later, we went back out to the same trail system where we heard the noise. We stopped along the trail to allow our dog to get a drink of water. My husband was preoccupied with the dog, and I was just taking in the scenery. I happened to hear some rustling on the ridge above us, and when I turned to look, I saw what I can only describe as a very large, bipedal creature, walking between the trees and brush. The creature was far enough away that I could not make out its features specifically, but it was very large. It had dark colored fur/hair, dark brown or black in color. I cannot give an exact height measurement, but the creature appeared to be approximately 6 ft tall—This estimate is based upon our survey of the surrounding trees where the creature was sighted on the ridge. I called for my husband to look over at the creature, but it disappeared over the crest of the ridge into the forest before he was able to see. Additionally, more recently, specifically, February 13, 2021, at 4:57 pm, I unintentionally recorded a wood knock while recording video of my dog. This instance also occurred on the same trail where my husband and I heard the howling/roaring and I saw the bipedal creature in Sept. 2020. I do have that footage, and the wood knock can clearly be heard."

She called us from the local Bob Evans parking lot in tears asking for us to come drive her home because she was so shook up.  It was a terrifying experience for her.

Field notes filed on August 18th, 2020 at 22:50 hours by Pleasant Hill Lake Park Ranger McLellan #915. On 08/18/2020 at 22:50 hours, Ashland County Sheriff's Office received a 911 call for unknown subjects throwing items at them from the woods at the Primitive Camp area located at Pleasant Hill lake Park in Ashland County, Ohio. Park Ranger McLellan was dispatched and arrived shortly on scene at campsite #417 and met with the caller Faith Steele and her family (husband and two kids). Witnesses advised that someone in the woods behind their campsite was throwing sticks or (rocks) at them and around their tent. Due to it being dark the witnesses could not see who was throwing things at them. The husband went on to say he first thought it might be kids messing around in the woods, but when he yelled into the woods he did not hear any voices or noises indicating children, so he did not believe it was kids. The witnesses said a few minutes later they heard strange loud or weird noises coming from the woods, at which time he made his young children go into the tent while he stood outside the tent with his small pocket knife out ""just in case"". Witnesses went on to say a few minutes later they heard a loud bang (or knock) as if someone had smacked or punched hard the side of the (wooden) outhouse restroom located nearby on the other side of the primitive camp. When they turned and looked in that direction they observed something run into the woods. The witness described what he saw as a tall, dark and hairy figure run and disappear into the woods. Witness said the first thing he thought of when he saw it was a Bigfoot. Park Ranger McLellan checked the area and was unable to locate anyone in the wooded area and did not observe any damage to the outhouse structure. These witnesses were the only people camping in that area of Pleasant Hill Lake Park at the time. No further investigation was warranted at the time."

I continued another ½ mile up the path to where the powerlines cross the river, from here the river bank drops 15ft, giving a nice view of the river below. As I approached this area, my eyes were immediately caught by someone down below at the river edge. What I saw was an all-black figure down at the river edge about 250ft away. I thought it was strange because not many people hike off trail into the preserve during the summers nor late in the evening or even pass the communication building. As I watched this “man” down at the river bank, I started to notice settle detail like golden-red hair in the sunset. I also didn’t notice any distinct clothing but hair alone. At this moment I remember being very confuse to what I was seeing. Whoever was down at the river, began to walk inland using it’s arms to move the reed bushes. That I saw it’s long hair dangling from its arm, shoulder to hand. “Omg, it’s bigfoot” I thought. I immediately began to reach for my phone without taking my eyes off the creature, that is when it noticed me. What terrified me the most was not able to make out any details in the face as we made eye contact. That is when I ran. I continued to ran until I met a couple with their dog back at the communication building. I will never forget the look of confusion on their faces when I came sprinting around the corner. I wanted to tell them about my experience but I continued to run as I thought they would not believe me. The following day I returned to look for footprints but was unable to venture into the overgrown foliage. The experience was not enough to scary me away completely, instead I was more cautious of the time of day and surroundings. I continued to exercise at Stinchcomb until I moved to AZ in July 2019."

My sightings began on Friday evening on the 8th when me and my girlfriend had arrived to the cabin at 8 PM. When we were parking we noticed a bunch of deer in the yard and I began to turn the highbeams on the car to look at the deer. We then went inside and I grabbed the spotlight and I was scanning through the yard and saw two sets of bright red eyes walking to the field. I have never seen something like this before. I am an outdoorsman and have hunted and fished first since I was eight years old. I then began to sit on our balcony and look around more after I had lost visual of the shining eyes. I could hear branches being snapped. I had a very weird feeling that I have never had there before at the cabin that I was being watched and it was very eerie. On Saturday the 9th of October 2021, I was sitting outside on the porch and heard a pack of coyotes start howling. In the 10 years that we have had the cabin I have never heard that before. Then I began to hear more branches from different angles.  And once again I had that feeling that I was being watched and I was not alone. I had also noticed a long impression behind the house that looks like a footprint up against the cabin by the window but was not good enough to say it was from a bigfoot, but at the same time it was adding up. Then on 11 October 2021 at around 9:30 AM there seem to have been an abnormal amount of deer in the yard and they were all skittish. I began to look around with my rifle scope and see what was causing them to act like that. I happened to notice something standing at the tree line at the top of the field that was rather tall and I thought at first it was a bear as they are common in the area. But then I also noticed how was standing straight up and down in the head shape was oval like a human's head. I was amazed and could not believe what I was seeing at first. When I put the scope to it I could see the indentations to the eye socket. The body was very massive.  I continue to hold the scope to it and then began to realize it knew I could see it and I knew it could see me. I could see it slowly moving its head from left to right as if it was scanning around the area. I then heard four individual whistles from towards the back of the property. And that’s when I noticed another Sasquatch not far from the first and I could still see the first one. The second one was staying quiet to try to remain hidden but it was moving through the bushes on the ground. Eventually it stopped moving as if they had sat down. I watched for about 30 min. The property has a big pond and plenty of cover to hide and plenty of food. Around at that time I had to leave and I left them be."

As we went by, we looked into the woods and didn't see anything. We didn't stop then but continued on until we finally stopped to talk about what we saw. It was really shocking. There were no sounds or smells. Didn't get a look at his face but as he was walking you could see how big his stride was. There was a huge space between his legs. On the way back we stopped and looked around for prints and marks but didn't see anything. The leaves were really heavy there and blowing all over.

71700,Report 71700: Trucker's daylight sighting of a Sasquatch in Francis Marion National Forest,Class A,2021-03-15T12:00:00Z,33.0932,-79.8102,2021,South Carolina,71700.0,I witnessed a 8-9 ft tall upright hominoid creature with black hair and brownish grey skin apparent on its face chest and abdomen. There was also noticeable scraggly matted hair hanging from its arms. It had wide bold shoulders and hair partly covering its forehead. The eyes were wide set and large. I witnessed this creature while on route to the Nucor Steel plant to deliver some steel coils from Canada while long haul trucking in spring of 2021. I saw it just for a few seconds as I was driving a big rig and there was water on either side of the road.
74788,Report 74788: RECENT:  Close range daylight sighting by three witnesses in vehicle in Hunting Island State Park,Class A,2022-08-02T12:00:00Z,32.37152,-80.44109,2022,South Carolina,74788.0,"On Tuesday, August 2, 2022 my brother, sister, and I were visiting the Lighthouse at South Carolina’s Hunting Island State Park.  We were leaving the Lighthouse parking lot at approximately 12:00 noon and driving along the exit road from the Lighthouse. My brother was driving the vehicle, with me riding in the front passenger seat,  and my sister being in the rear driver’s side seat.  As we were rounding a slight curve on the exit road, we all spotted a creature walking quickly on the left side of the road approximately 15 to 20 feet in front of our car.  The incident happened very quickly as the creature disappeared into the lush Palmetto & Pine forest ( jungle) that surrounds the exit road. My brother stopped the car immediately and asked if we had seen what he saw.  All three of us reported seeing the creature.  We all saw the creature very clearly as it was walking directly in front of our car.  The three of us recalled and reported the exact and identical descriptions. The creature was walking upright, taking strides quickly to our left,  and disappeared into the bush on the left side of the road directly in front of us.  We only witnessed the lower torso of the creature as it’s head and shoulders were hidden behind a pine tree and a palmetto stump on the left side of the road. The height of the creature is estimated as being between 5 to 6 feet tall.  Legs were approximately 3 feet long, human like jointed knee, with dark brown, splotchy black hair that was approximately 2 inches long.  The incident happened quickly and lasted for only a few seconds as the creature disappeared quickly into the thick underbrush.  There were no sounds or odors noticed by any of us. We were all in a state of amazement as to what occurred as it happened so quickly.  We have enjoyed taking many vacations at the park throughout the years since we were children in the 1950’s to the present.  While the area is abundant in wildlife, we have never witnessed anything like this in the past. The three of us reported the incident to the Hunting Island State Park office on August 3, 2022 at around 12:00 noon.  The Park Superintendent called me a short time later and I provided him with a full description and details of the incident.  He informed me that he would take the report as a credible incident and initiate an investigation. Bob Frady, PhD Here is the phone interview with eyewitness Dr. Robert Frady:"

We were headed home. There is a large wooded area as you are in Dyer county and Gibson county . I look to my left glancing at the woods just before the river. I did a double take. Told my wife and my son, ""You wont believe what I just saw!"" I estimate it to be about 7-8 ft in high. I didn't stop because a vehicle was behind me. I have went over it several times in my head to what I saw. There are no bear here and it wasn't a human or anything else I have seen. That's my sighting."
69641,Report 69641: Close-range multi-witness sighting 3 miles west of Lawrenceburg,Class A,2021-06-12T12:00:00Z,35.22149,-87.39061,2021,Tennessee,69641.0,"My husband and I saw a what we believe to be a Sasquatch on the night of June 12, 2021. We were driving home together with our daughter at approximately 9:30 PM when we turned onto our street. Mind you, we live in the deep country side outside of Lawrenceburg Tennessee. My husband turned the wheel slightly to turn onto our street and there was an animal with fingers touching something on the ground, picking at it with its fingers. When the animal saw our headlights turning, it intentionally averted the headlights and ducked underneath them. It was only about five feet from the front of our vehicle at one point when we turned toward it. It was fully in the headlights. The animal bounded across our neighbors yard. It did not run on two feet the way a human would. We thought the animal was a gorilla at first because of its movements but it looked extremely human like. It bounded with its front legs in the same way that a gorilla does except it’s arms were so long and it moved unbelievably fast. Of course we considered that it could have been a person dressed in a hairy costume but it moved way too fast to be a person. It was definitely not a bear. It was more like a gorilla or person covered with hair. It was covered in dark brown or black hair. The animal cleared our neighbors 250-300 foot grass lawn in about six seconds and then it disappeared from view. Our daughter who is four did not see the animal as she was playing on her iPad. When we pulled up to our house a minute later I was absolutely terrified to get out of the vehicle because we had no idea what we had seen, and because it was so fast that it could have turned around and been to our house in about 10 seconds. I got up the courage to run to my house door and unlocked it and we all ran inside. We were terrified. We both saw the animal, however it was my husband who saw that it had fingers and it was observing something on the ground. I did not see that part. I just saw the part where it started to run and when it cleared our neighbors lawn. We had considered that maybe it was a bear but it was too ape like to have been a bear and it was too fast and slim and did not run on all four of its legs exactly the way a bear would have."
47702,Report 47702: Early evening sighting near a home and strange deer kills investigated at Canyon Lake,Class A,2015-01-09T12:00:00Z,29.52533,-98.15854,2015,Texas,47702.0,"On January 9th, 2015 @ about 5:20-5:30 p.m. at Canyon Lake, Texas, my family and I were backing out of our drive way, and the weather was bad that day, kind of hazy, misty rain, and it was about 37 degrees. I had my high beams on because it was beginning to get dark outside.  As I backed out of the driveway my lights caught the attention of a very big creature about 9 foot tall grayish blonde in color with a 4 to 4 1/2 ft across from shoulder to shoulder, standing in front of an oak tree, it turn towards me from about 40 yards away, and it stood with its arms down at it's side, I asked my son to look and I looked away briefly, when I looked back it was gone.  The following Friday my wife and step daughter, while walking along the shoreline of the lake, discovered a bloody and strange deer kill site (fresh kill), the deer's neck was broken and twisted all he way around, lungs, heart, and liver were gone and the deer's intestinal content was thrown about, the back half of the deer was eaten,the front shoulder was eaten,but not the other shoulder. I called the BFRO and left a message, J.D. from San Antonio came out and took pictures of the scene, I asked him if I should roll the deer over because of the shoulder bone sticking out.  After rolling over I pulled the hide back and there was a sharp edged stone underneath the hide with flesh and blood on the stone--I kept this stone--there was also a 10 feet dragging kill-blood streak across the rocks, then it abruptly stops, and the deer's carcass seems to be thrown about 15 feet from that spot with no blood stains in between the two spots.  Upon further investigating I discovered a 5 foot long stick about 1 1/4 in diameter-rigid, with a sharp end on it, and the end of it had deer hair and flesh on it, like it was used to either stab the deer or just to hold it down, then it broke the deers neck, the kill was made from the waters edge side not the woods side, meaning the thing that killed the deer was hiding in the water...I also discovered tracks some were 19 inches long but were not castable, not enough definition, also found some tracks that were 14 inches long, and some 11 inches long along the shoreline down from the kill site, all of them were not castable it had also been raining that whole week off and on.  Upon even more research we discovered At least 5 other deer carcasses in the general area.  Called area fish and game warden out and she walked the area and observed all of the evidence on Sunday January 18th.."

Sulphur, out of no where, we start hearing hollering down in the creek. Loud howling!! Only it sounded as if a very large Curly of ""three stooges"", yelling whoooooop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop. Absolutely clear as day and so loud!! For like 15-20 min. Up and down the creek, almost no diminished sound though. It sounded, for the life of me, like a mother calling a child back home. Never heard it before."

At the edge of my headlights something appeared on the side of the road. I slammed on my brakes, and before we stopped it, he'd crossed the road. It had taken one step onto the middle of the road and the next was on the other side. Then it went over a barb wire fence with a step. We sat there trying to make sense of what we had just seen and the only thing we could think of is sasquatch. This has changed our whole outlook on what might be out there."
51821,Report 51821: Family has multiple sightings and interactions in their backyard near Elgin,Class A,2014-12-08T12:00:00Z,30.40335,-97.2836,2014,Texas,51821.0,"12-6-2014 to 10-2015 Incident began with rocks being chunked at my daughter, myself and my brother after returning from visiting my Dad in hospital. We stopped to report his condition to my brother. We were very loud, laughing and talking and a rock chunked from out in the yard in the trees. At that time no homes nearby as we live rural. Two wks before my Dad was putting his trash in the can and happened to feel someone watching him and he looked up to see in the moonlight (full moon) dead on straight away about 20 ft from him a tall 8ft brownish figure looking at him. They stared at each other for a long moment and my Dad tossed his trash, looked up and it was gone. My Dad doesn't believe in Bigfoot but my brother is disabled and sits up outside on the patio every night. He had heard whoops, stick fighting, growling and saw figures at the fence line. I decided to try interacting with whatever it was so I began wrapping sandwiches, cookies, veggies, meat, eggs etc. every day I made a lunch which I wrapped in bread wrapper and placed in Plastic grocery bag and hung in a tree branch near where we heard noises. Everyday the food was gone. Once it left me 5 potatoes from the neighbors garden above us. I would leave a dozen raw eggs or boiled an they tap the ends of the eggs and suck the middle. They did not eat celery, carrots or spicy crackers, but loved tortillas, breads, cake, all meats and peanut butter or nuts. I fed for almost a year and smelled them many many times, we heard a sweet growl several times. Once my brother saw its backside walking to a tree. It chunked some rocks at me as I was at the far end of the pasture. Each toss the rock became closer. My brother said come back before it hits you. I began walking back and he pointed where it was beside a tree and I saw the side of it. About 8 ft tall grayish/ brownish like tree bark. I began calling it ""Trudy"" when feeding it. Sometimes it would let me know it was there, and if it was, all was totally silent, nothing moving. When coyotes would be howling nearby it would let out a shrill scream and the woods became silent. I sat many evenings beside gift tree and it never hurt me. Never attempted to hurt me. Actually would give a low growl. Once I left a pink cup to see what it would do and it would toss it in the ditch. I hung a tiny angel Christmas ornament and they removed it and never found it. One evening my husband drove up and they tossed rocks at his truck. We mounted a game cam but never had any pics except of myself feeding. Many pics of orbs. My brother said he thinks by voices and calls there was male, female and young ones. I know for fact they are harmless and are very caring. Two new homes moved into our area and they have now left us. I miss them and still go down into the pasture hoping they will throw a rock. 4-2016 coming in from nearest town approaching a bridge repair so I slowed down and it was 7:15 on a clear evening I saw standing in a clearing a huge dark reddish brown figure in the tree line. I was shocked to see it dead on in open daylight. I looked back at my lane and over to clearing & it was gone. Its hair looked 5 inches long on the head to the neck area and 8 inches on the body. It was standing in tall grass so couldn't see below waist. After interacting and watching for a year I notice the hair color changes with the season. There are many ditches, reservoirs, acres of uninhabited woods and many creek beds. We have gardens, wild berries and wild plums so I think they can stay hidden. I have pics of tracks, I have bags I saved she left me to refill. I don't care what scientist say I know they are real and very sweet. Nobody should hurt them as I think they'd only hurt you if you tried to cause them harm. I would not trade my time spent with them for anything."

It was dark black, had long arms, running way too fast for a person, black fur, 7 to 8 feet tall, wide shoulders, had a long neck. I couldn't see its face, but I saw its head and it was kind of oval.

56826,Report 56826: Close daytime sighting on a ranch in the Canadian River Valley,Class A,2014-07-14T12:00:00Z,35.93985,-100.6767,2014,Texas,56826.0,"I had just loaded some oil drilling equipment to haul back to the oil company yard for them. I had been driving down the lease road going through a very large ranch on the Canadian River Valley in the Texas Panhandle. It was about 7:30 p.m.  I was driving very slow, approximately 10-15 MPH, because the ranch has speed limits on their lease roads and the roads are very rough. This location is on private property and out of respect for the landowner I will not disclose the location. It is a very desolate area, about 23 miles to the nearest town. There are very few homes in the area with about 5-10 miles between homes. It was unusual weather for mid-July. It was warm but overcast with clouds and a breeze coming out the north. It was still very bright for it was over an hour before sunset. I was driving along noticing how heavy the plum bushes were loaded. We haven’t had a good crop of Sand Plums in several years on account of the severe drought that we had been suffering from. I noticed out of my peripheral vision what looked to be a very tall and very thick butt of a bull. I kept thinking this was very unusual to see a river ranch bull that is so large and thick. I have only seen this type of bull on the show circuit, I have showed cattle in 4-H and FFA and my kids showed cattle also, I grew up on a dairy farm and we also raised beef cattle, I have raised cattle for over 40 years and been around many different breeds of cattle, yet this one was exceptionally large. As I got closer to this bull I starting getting a clearer look at it.  Bulls this thick typically don't have much of a tail head, they are pretty flat topped, but this one did. As I got closer I realized he didn't have a tail at all.  The hair was wrong and too long for a bull. It was brown with a reddish tint on the ends as if sun bleached. This bull has 4-6 inch long, bleached out strawberry blonde, matted hair hanging just above mid-point on him. I then notice that I couldn’t see under this bull, and that it’s very wide at the ground level. This made no sense. By this time, there was no brush between me and him to block my view of this thing! He was standing in the open on bare ground. There was a large shade tree; the cattle used a good bit because there was no grass around the tree. Then it HIT me, this is a Bigfoot. I cannot believe it. Not 70 feet from me. My pickup and trailer are a total of 65 feet long so it was pretty easy to figure the distance to him. I realize I caught the big fellow out in the wide open. I knew I was coming up on a curve in the road and I could drive off into a deep ditch so I looked up to stay on the road, hitting my brakes to stop. I didn't take my eyes off of him for more than 2 seconds, but that was all he needed. He was gone. There is a small canyon about 30 feet to the south of where he was.  I believe he went that direction.  I jumped out of my truck and ran down to the end of my trailer to try to see this massive creature again, then I realized, with its size and speed that was probably not a good idea. As I walked back to my truck, watching my back, I knew where he had been standing and that there was probably footprints and knuckle prints there that I could take pictures of, I had my camera with me, and I’d have proof to show my family of what I saw. But I also knew he could be on top of me in 2 seconds if I went over there. I had my phone and my camera with me but it never entered my mind to grab them while the creature was standing there in front of me. I have always heard of these being described as massive creatures. Truly that is the only way to describe it. The shoulders and arms were massive. I didn't get a good look at its face because I was too busy  wondering why I couldn't see under it, so I focused more on the lower half. But I did notice the contrasting colors of its face. It was lighter around the eyes and darker over the nose and I think I caught him with sand plums in his mouth because of the red tint in the lip area. He looked to be at least 5' 6"" tall down on his knuckles and could be easily taller than that. He was very wide, I am 6'3"" and 235 lbs and he was at least 1 1/2 to 2 of me in width. Down on my knuckles I am on 3 feet tall. I know their arms are longer than humans, but this still makes him a very tall boy! I have had to estimate the weight of cattle most of my life and was always been within 10 -25 lbs of guessing them correctly. And I would estimate him weighing in the neighborhood of 850 lbs. With that said he could easily weigh more because of the shear muscle mass that I could see."

Outside of Grapeland Texas, on a private ranch. My brother-in-law asked if I wanted to go with him and my father-in-law to the private ranch that he managed and check the hog traps he had set. They had been overrun with them for a while and he had caught 20 in the past weeks. I said yes, and we were off, it was mid day and still bright and clear. We were in my brother-in-laws truck he was driving, me in the middle, and my father-in-law at the passenger side. When we got to the gate of the property, my FIL got out and opened the gate and we pulled thru and waited for him to close the gate and get in. As soon as he got in, we slowly started to pull forward...Then, from our left out of the pine thicket came this HUGE thing, about 8 1/2 to 9ft tall,and very dark brown almost black hair 3 to 4 inch long. Huge chest and shoulders, long arms and no neck,it ran with incredible speed..in 3 long strides it covered from the trees across the road in front of us and into the right side tree line which is 30 ft.  and then over a fence onto another mans property which is part of ELKHART CREEK and flows to the Trinity River. It made no sound. And we had our windows down.This creature was clearly seen by all 3 of us and we just sat there for awhile to gather our wits...Then I started laughing..I wasn't scared. Just shocked..I said ""What do Yall think that was""? They said, You KNOW WHAT IT WAS...AINT NO BEAR! They both swore they would never mention it to anyone.. they were afraid people would think they are nuts and they would lose their jobs..I am A retired Police officer and didn't care... It has changed my life. My BIL then said ""Well that explains what tore up my big Hog Trap!!"

57760,Report 57760: Nighttime sighting in a backyard in Round Rock,Class A,2017-06-23T12:00:00Z,30.51559,-97.67403,2017,Texas,57760.0,"I know there will be many who will not believe what I am about to relate as I am still having trouble coming to terms with all of it myself. My plan was to not post anything about what happened last night and pretend it was all just a dream - but the nightmare continues to haunt me even during the day.  I can’t shake the image I had seen or the sounds I had heard.  And the only way for me to make sense of and deal with any of it is to write it down while it’s still fresh in my memory. I’ll just come out and say it.  Last night (Friday, June 23, 2017) I saw a very large and tall “thing” in our backyard, and it would seem to have been the being otherwise known as (dare I say it?) BIG FOOT! I’m sure it sounds crazy, but it’s true.  And I consider myself to be one who quickly debunks extraordinary claims by others concerning UFO activity, Lock Ness Monster shenanigans, and - yes - even BIG FOOT sightings. Our youngest son used to watch those goofy BIG FOOT shows to where my wife and I would offhandedly snicker to one another at his fervent belief in something so obviously fake. Come on!  None of that stuff is real.  It’s made up by kids, people who are in desperate need of professional assistance, or those  seeking attention.  I wish what I experienced wasn’t true, and fell into one of the aforementioned categories as my life would be less complicated. Here’s what happened: It all started off as a regular Friday evening.  Drum students were drumming in the studio, our children were playing video games,   my wife was cleaning, and I was working on writing parts for an upcoming show.  Something I do best while enjoying the company of great music. I remember loudly listening to 2112 and the A side of the album had run it’s course, requiring me to get up and turn the record over in order to listen to the B side.  As I approached the turntable I thought I had seen someone running down by our creek area.  Which is odd because the individual would have to be very tall, much taller than what would be considered a normal sized person, for me to see from where I had been standing.  I stopped the record player and curiously walked over to the french doors located on the West side of our home. Everything appeared quiet and normal.  I didn’t notice anything.  I thought nothing more about it (at the time) and went back to attending to my music writing.  This is when things suddenly became …strange. While listening to the song “Twilight Zone” (by Rush) I heard an unusual howling-type noise which created a dissonant clash with what I was accustomed to hearing during that particular song.  At first I thought something may have been wrong with my speakers, but the bizarre sound continued even when I had turned the music off. It almost sounded like a “hoot,” though much deeper and varied. Our three dogs began nervously congregating by the door, and seemed extremely agitated as each paced back and forth.  They even began doing their own unusual howling, something I had never witnessed any of them to do prior to (or since) yesterday evening. I thought there must have been another dog or possibly one of the wild coyotes recently observed in our neighborhood, hanging out by the creek. In order to ensure the safety of our dogs (I didn’t want any of our pets getting rabies, or eaten!) I grabbed a broom - not the best choice for a weapon - and opened the door to investigate. This is where things happened rapidly.  It’s all pretty much a big blur at this point. As I shut the door our littlest dog (Elphaba) squeezed through the narrow opening and bolted toward the back fence overlooking the creek area. She looked cute running at breakneck speed.  That was until I looked up and noticed this large creature in our creek area glancing in our direction by the swing - with glowing greenish-yellow eyes - as it quickly turned away and ran to the South, following the flow of our creek until it quickly disappeared. I was stunned.  Where I was expecting a little nuisance I had found a magnificently imposing creature.  The likes of which I hadn’t thought possible, much less probable. It was surreal to watch such a large creature move so quickly as it bounded toward highway 79, and retreated underneath the overpass and beyond. I only caught a brief glimpse of the thing.  It was tall, hairy, had large feet, and it was extraordinarily fast for it’s size. All that remained was the memory of those few fleeting seconds, and a swing gently swayed in the wake of the awesome being’s hasty movements. Apparently my wife had heard our dogs making their odd noises  in our home and opened the door only to find me standing along the edge of our fence holding our littlest dog and staring at…nothing. I didn’t know how to respond when she asked me what it was that I was looking at - for I wasn’t sure for myself. The last thing we both heard was that strange sounding and ear-piercing howling-hoot.  We just looked at one other while our dogs responded in kind with their own versions of the odd sound. My wife had asked what made the noise, and I didn’t know what to say. It was a rough night.  I had read the claims by the folks in our Round Rock Parks & Recreation Department, and subsequent sightings.  It all had seemed so silly, even childish. And yet, overnight, my opinion had changed - in a huge way. It’s a big deal for me to share what I experienced in our creek area last night.  I have a feeling there will be unbelievers (heck, I had been one myself).  I’m ok with that as I know what we heard and what I saw.  And Elphaba saw it, too. And the weirdest thing of all was how happy our dogs seemed once they were all outside.  As if they were glad to be around a long lost friend.  They were smelling vigorously, and wagged their tails as they looked toward where the swing was still moving. The best thing is we feel confident we’ll know if we’re ever visited again as our dogs will most likely make those same strange sounds, perhaps as an announcement letting us know of their returning friend. And we will be ready next time, camera in hand. Saturday, June 23, 2017."

As we neared the end of the road, within sight of the farm-road, a large, solid-black animal came out of the woods on the east side of the road, walking slowly on two legs. It was between 7-8 feet tall, and solid-black. It looked like it had a healthy-weight, more than a human. Definitely not a black bear! It appeared trim and muscular, with it's long arms hanging down past it's knees. It's upper-profile reminded me of ""Homer Simpson"" (best description I can think of). The thing was about 20ft. from the front of the pick-up, causing me to come to a stop. It knew my truck was there, but it continued it's slow pace, seemingly without care. The scariest part of the encounter was when it paused and looked at us. It's eyes reflected like glowing embers when the parking lights from my truck hit it. The thing continued walking, stepping over the road-grade and continuing into the forest. I stopped my truck and I could still hear it crunching around in the woods out of sight now as it walked away. I am a retired combat veteran and I don't scare easy, but I was. We left immediately. My son only caught the tail end of the sighting but confirmed he saw something. The dirt road was well packed so I couldn't see any footprints left behind. It was very unsettling for me because it looked so human, and because it had the size and presence that it could have harmed us or done serious damage to my truck if it wanted to. I used to enjoy hiking and sleeping alone in the woods at night in my hammock, but not anymore. I know what's out there with me now in the woods!"
62926,Report 62926: Sighting at dawn by motorist NE of Avinger near Black Cypress Creek,Class A,2019-05-30T12:00:00Z,34.03789,-94.32321,2019,Arkansas,62926.0,"I drive the same route every evening to work a night shift at a hospital in Atlanta Tx.  I drive from near Avinger Tx to Atlanta down Hwy 155.   I was running late and got behind a guy towing a boat and he was going well below the speed limit so I took the first opportunity to pass him. He sped up causing me to have to speed up to pass and as soon as I got around him a state trooper came over the hill and I was flying, about 85 mph.  I knew I was in the wrong but the hwy takes a right turn and there is a county road to the left (cr 1579).  I turned there really quickly before the trooper was able to see me and he flew past the turn off and missed me. I did not really know where I was after I turned right on CR 1580 and it dead ends at Black Cypress Creek.  I turned around and started back the way I had come and glanced in the rearview mirror and that is when I saw it cross the road about 75 yards behind me.  I have a dash camera on the front but not on the back.  I tried to swing it around to get it on film but the footage was terrible. I know what I saw.  It was at least 7 ft tall and black as a hog but had to weigh over 400 lbs.  It was a freak encounter but I know what I saw.  I never believed any of this but there is no doubt at all.  It was looking at my jeep as it crossed behind me and then it was just gone.  I have not been back there and I am not sure if I will go back."
63665,Report 63665: Multiple incidents reported by multiple hunters near Sam Rayburn Lake,Class A,2019-11-18T12:00:00Z,31.1659,-94.1679,2019,Texas,63665.0,"I have multiple reports to make. Bigfoot is living in the Angelina National Forest, no doubts. My husband grew up hunting there, but I have only been hunting in there for the past 4-5 years. Geography, it is on Sam Rayburn lake, piney woods with thick yaupon brush and a public hunting area that is very secluded. We typically hunt between a dirt road and the lake, there are 'fingers' or peninsulas of land. I grew up very close to the Big Thicket & spent my life in the woods but I began to feel uncomfortable in there, unlike hunting or hiking anywhere else. My husband also noticed this feeling of being watched or hunted, as did guest we brought with us. The 1st experience, my husband was sitting on the ground hunting for deer. He saw some movement far up in a pine tree. There are large birds (eagles/hawks/woodpeckers etc) so that's what he expected it to be. But a head and shoulders peeked around, looked at him, out stretched an arm and then it jumped to the next tree over. Then it proceeded to jump from tree to tree approaching towards him. It was small woman/large child sized and too far away to make out much other than its shape. But it clearly was ape-like. He left before it got any closer & we left out of there for the day. No other experiences that year (2016). I dubbed this general area bigfoot's backyard, jokingly. At this point I knew he saw something but I wasn't REALLY ready to call it Bigfoot. We no longer camped out there after that. The next year I was in Bigfoot's backyard walking very slow & quiet listening for squirrels. I was squirrel hunting dressed in camo and was closer to the dirt road than the lake. It was in October and almost dark when I heard this growl (if you can call it that!). It came from the thick brush about 50' behind me. It was the deepest most guttural GRR-UMPH. We don't really have bear here but I fully expected to turn around to a grizzly bear as loud & deep as the growl was, but I didn't see anything. We left immediately. Later in Nov. my husband was hunting a few hundred yards from that spot and something growled & growled at him until he left. Deep deep guttural growling. This was (2017) and we no longer waited until after dark to leave our hunting spots. A couple of acquaintances of my husband, a father & son, was looking for a public land spot to hunt deer. He gave them a tour of the spots off of that dirt road. These guys moved here from bear country, so let that be known. They had tree climbing stands, so no visible ladder from the ground. They go out there by themselves, they pick bigfoots backyard to hunt in. The son arrives 1st and and climbs 30' up a tree. It is the exact spot I was growled at before. A little later the dad arrives. He comes in, crosses a little creek right by the son & goes down toward the lake. It gets quiet then the son heard something walking, he naturally thinks it's a deer. He watched a huge dark hairy creature walking upright on two legs, not just walk in the direction of where his dad went, but walk the exact trail he took. There isn't phone signal in that spot. He told me he wasn't about to move in case it saw him. The dad was never aware he was stalked by bigfoot, climbed up in the tree and didn't see anything out of the ordinary. They never went back. I think that was in 2017, November or December. This year my husband went out there first and hunted bigfoot's backyard and told me it felt comfortable in there. This lulled me into going back out there. I didn't feel comfortable at all. I heard strange whistling and sniffing noises, and the next time, loud repetitive whoop whoop whoop. I declared the woods still had bigfoot & few deer and I wasn't returning anymore. So husband goes a few times by himself. One evening, he sits in a lean-to stand that is maybe 1/8 of a mile from bigfoot's backyard. It has a ladder and is 12' off the ground. This is a new hunting spot and unfortunately a bigfoot hunting party stumbles onto my husband. He is facing a draw with a small creek that runs down to the lake (to his left). The dirt road is through some thick yaupon brush to his right. Behind him and across the draw is thick yaupon brush also. They clear cut timber company land a few hundred yards ahead of him, although it's not visible from the stand. It's a Monday and he is the only human out there hunting, 5:15pm November 18, 2019. He see the back end of a deer go into the woods. It had crossed the draw, had come in down wind and was heading towards the clear cut area. My husband was dressed in full camo, didn't spray scent killer and had in fact gotten scented candle on himself. He hears a strange deep HUM-Phhh from the youpon behind and to his left. At first he thought it could have been a deer, although a strange noise for a deer. It makes a low growing noise and starts moving back & forth in the brush. Its obviously big & heavy. Then it starts UMPH UMPH UMPH very loudly. This makes my husband VERY uncomfortable. Then it does a howl, like a wolf, but cuts it short. Like a 2 second extremely loud howl that just abruptly ends. Hair raising howls. Another abrupt howl answers him from down the draw towards the lake followed by three loud knocks, loud as gunshots. We assume they were tree knocks. Then the one closest starts talking in gibberish. Hearable but not loudly. My husband announces that if it a person playing a joke they are about to get shot at. The gibberish stops and is replaced by even louder growling and it advances towards him. He fires a shot from his rifle towards the growling because at this point he is fearful of being attacked. They start charging towards him. He could see the tops of the youpon parting way. The loud growling and brush was breaking so loud. He shimmied down the ladder and ran for his truck pushing his way through the brush. The two growling creatures stayed just a little bit behind him all the while growling, breaking over small trees & just ripping brush up. They chased him to the road, but never stepped out. He ran to his truck and left. Based on these experiences there are some facts that I truly believe. Bigfoot is a real animal not a mythical creature. It is smart, hunts in pairs or groups and is definitely a meat eating predator, and in this area deer & wild hog are plentiful. It has communicative skills, although primitive. It has a VERY good sense of smell that would rival that of a dog/hog/deer. Their young spend alot of time in the trees. They drive their prey into areas where it is easier to catch, like close to water. They most likely have ""scouts"" when humans are in the area & their family unit is close by. They do not like humans to surprise them and will do their best to scare the humans out of their territory if they deem them too close or dangerous."

67199,Report 67199: Daylight sighting on the Brazos River west of Weatherford,Class A,2020-10-23T12:00:00Z,32.66908,-98.03284,2020,Texas,67199.0,"Hello, my name is Ricardo. On Friday the 23rd of October, 2020, my wife and I were seeing if a restaurant in Texas was opened so we could have lunch. It was around 1 pm. The name of the restaurant is called the Catfish Cafe, located just West of Weatherford, Texas on Interstate Hwy 20, right next to the Brazos River. There was only one worker at the restaurant, and he told us that the restaurant would not open until 4pm. So, my wife and I decided to drive around the countryside in that area and kill some time until 4 pm. Immediately just west of the restaurant about 50 yards or so, is a bridge that goes across the Brazos River. We headed across it and stopped in the center of the bridge to look at the river scenery when we spotted a huge dark figure on the river wading in the water around ankle deep. This thing was about a quarter mile north from the bridge. At first we thought it could be a man that was kicking the water, chasing a possible fish or something, but looking at the object a little closer, we knew that it was not a man because it was dark, tall, and hairy. We believe that it was a bigfoot looking for his meal. We stayed there on the bridge for a good 5 minutes, as no cars were coming. We drove around for awhile after that and came back to the restaurant about 3:45 pm stopping again on the bridge to see if that thing was still there. It wasn't, and we then got our food to go and went back home to our house in Weatherford. You guys are the first people we have told about this incident."
69015,Report 69015: Motorist daylight sighting 35 miles north of Austin,Class A,2017-06-24T12:00:00Z,30.77532,-97.93719,2017,Texas,69015.0,"This sighting has stayed with me for a long time.  I didn't want to submit it at first, but based on the number of sightings identified I am now forwarding on what I saw. My son and I were driving down county road 200 in Liberty Hill, TX.  We came to the end and made a right turn on county road 236.  We were heading towards Killeen, TX at the time and it was in the morning. At the time, the car I was driving had two little plastic pieces on the front of it that were designed to create sound to scare away deer.  I got them because my car was a small car and I didn't know if they would help, but as this is an area with a lot of deer, it was worth a try.  I am not sure if this is what scared what I saw. Just after we made the right on county road 236 I saw what I thought was a gorilla on the left side of the road.  It seemed agitated and as we got closer it ran across the road and climbed into a tree on the other side.  At that point I saw the tree move wildly with the leaves and branches swaying like it was extremely angry, or like a strong wind had hit it.  As the day was calm the only thing that could have caused this was whatever jumped into the tree. I didn't look up and I didn't stop due to my son being with me, but that sighting has always remained with me as it was so unusual.  I have seen gorillas in the zoo and it looked similar.  I would say that it was relatively tall and was standing on its hind legs as I got closer to it and as it raced across the street in front of us.  It didn't seem as tall as I would have imagined... maybe 6ft.  It was hard to tell height from where I was in correlation to what I saw. After this event I checked to see if a gorilla had escaped anywhere near me and didn't find anything.  To many this will sound like a tall tale, but to me it was very vivid."

49746,Report 49746: Motorist observes an adult Bigfoot with a baby cross the road at night North of Bedford,Class A,2015-09-09T12:00:00Z,37.38661,-79.55045,2015,Virginia,49746.0,"On September 9, 2015, I was driving down 43 (W) outside of Bedford, Virginia at 11:38PM when I saw to the right side of the road, walking away from the road, a Bigfoot with child.  It was next to the mail box for 4472 on 43, where there is a gravel poured drive.  At first I thought it was a deer, about same coloring, but as I got closer I noticed it was not a deer at all, it was much taller, about 6 ft., from the hips down. As I got closer it appeared the Mom (I assume that since there was a baby with it) put the baby down and was bending over for rocks?  At that time the baby looked right at me and it looked just like the Wukie (?, the furry, hairy creature) on Star Wars and it had a brown looking nose.  The baby seemed as surprised to see me as I was them, I guess WE look like aliens to them.  The baby was about 3 ft., it hit the mom at mid thigh.  I painted circles around the footprints I found the next day, 3 prints, with about a 36” stride.  The first print you come upon is the best, prints are difficult to produce in gravel, but the first one is in fine gravel.  There are two circles next to each other where it appeared the mom put the baby down.  They were headed into the woods and although there are deer around, there was a path worn in that direction. I reported this to the local Police dept and it was ignored, basically, they did not bother to even look at the prints.  The guy who took my report said, ""In ten years, I have never heard of such around these parts."""

The arm hair was much longer at eighteen inches. The face was hair covered like a mans beard and lighter in color.. The Sasquatch had the same look that I had, a surprised look. Eyes were opened wide and mouth. I seen no teeth. The head was not cone shaped. Eyes were brown and looking me up and down. The right arm was stuck out to the side with a bend. I didn't see ears."

It had medium size brown eyes and said no way in the world it was a bear. It saw her, then it turned around and started to fast walk away down the hill on two feet. It went behind a fence in front of our house. The fence is covered with weeds but some spots are open. It was crouched down and peeking at her as it worked its way down  the fence. When it got around the corner it stood up and ran down the hill out of sight. I don't know what she saw but it was as big as me and I'm 6ft 1. She thinks it was a Bigfoot"

Me and my boyfriend were working for the Roanoke Times delivering newspapers when this encounter happened.  We delivered anywhere from 12am-6am. We were almost done with the route when we went to turn down this dead end maintenance road since there was houses at the end of that who got the paper.  It was around 3:30-4am. While My boyfriend was going down the gravel end maintenance road the headlights caught a glimpse of this thing standing right at where the grass met the road. It stood about 7ft tall and it took off up the hill. It kinda walked fast, not necessarily ran. It was dark brown and had shaggy hair like fur. It was on 2 feet and walked like a human with its arms swaying back in forth right below the knees. I screamed out for my boyfriend to stop the car, but by time his reaction time kicked in whatever it was had already made it's way up the hill. My boyfriend positioned the car so the lights would shine up that hill and that's when we saw 2 bright glowing red/yellow eyes looking back at us. What was strange was it was hiding behind a huge tree and how high the eyes was up from the ground was close to 7ft tall. You could clearly see the eyes blink. We sat there for approximately 10 minutes and finally decided to finish up the route and come back. We did eventually come back after we got done with the last house and it was gone, but you could see where tree limbs and grass was pushed down from where it was standing on the side of the road. Maybe less then a month before we had that encounter we had heard tree knocks while on our route, from deep down in the woods maybe a neighborhood or two over. It scared us so bad when we heard it that we just bagged the newspaper up and threw it on the side of the road."
67232,Report 67232: Night time sighting by motorist outside Williamsburg near I-64,Class A,2020-10-22T12:00:00Z,37.33226,-76.70926,2020,Virginia,67232.0,"My two boys, ex-husband, and I were heading back to our hotel from dinner in Williamsburg, on the evening of October 22, 2020.  I took a left turn onto E Rochambeau Dr., which parallels interstate 64.  It was a clear night, dark and around 8:55pm.  I know that it was after 8:50 pm and before 9:00pm, because I was hoping to get back to watch the 9 pm debate. My son made a comment about my speed, and I pointed out a 55 mph speed limit sign, as we passed it.  I rounded a corner and saw a brief small glitter, which lead my eye to see movement.  I quickly could tell that it was an upright, bi-pedal figure.  As it walked quickly from right to left, I immediately could see that it walked like a human, but it was extremely broad and huge.  The arms and upper thighs were so big that I could see the outline of muscles.  The figure was blacker than black, almost looking like an enormous shadow figure, but solid.  My lights only revealed blackness, no clothes, just one solid figure.  I could see from the middle of the face and most of the legs.  I saw no features, as it was walking, only showing it's side to me.  It moved smoothly and quickly.  I could not see it's feet, or the top of the head. It happened so quickly that I didn't have time to say look, to my family who was with me.  As soon as it stepped of the side, I immediately said, ""What was that?!"".  I was curious to where it went, and as I passed the area, I could see that it went into the woods. There were no cars, people or anyone else on the road.  There was one house a little further down the road that had a front porch light on.  I keep trying to understand the distance from my car to the area it walked in the woods, trying to understand the height.  What I saw was huge, no way could any human be as huge, tall, and broad as this.  Again it was black, so black, and my lights didn't reveal details which is odd.  My children were completely freaked out, so I did not stop.  I've returned twice to the area to look at the road and surroundings."

Within seconds we saw an animal of some sort, traveling upright, covered in smooth black fur, moving southwest, to northeast very quickly. We could only see from about the animal's upper thigh upward. The head was round with no visible neck, and we could see no facial features. We saw the animal only from its left side. From the moment it first appeared, until it moved out of sight, was only about 3-5 seconds. In that span of time it covered approximately 60 yards through thick brush, over uneven terrain. There was a stiff breeze from the East/Northeast, so I don't believe that the animal scented us, or knew we were there. I have been a hunter, a trapper, camper and woodsman for more than 50 of my 62 years. This animal was upright (on 2 legs). It definitely was not a bear. I have seen many bears. I could not identify it at all. I have been in the woods every day since with a video camera. I found what I believe to be stick structures and 2 dens, but I don't know what animal they belong to. I am puzzled, but committed to identifying this animal, if I can. I and 4 friends are going out tomorrow night with some thermal imaging equipment and some super sensitive sound recorders."

As we came closer this creature stepped onto the edge of the highway looking dead off into my friend's face as we passed, me braking, I looked into the review side mirror only to see it take two steps onto the highway. I turned to look back at the road ahead so as not to crash, I returned my gaze to my mirrors only to have it gone from the road. It was not a person or a bear, absolutely not.

We drove to the top stopping about halfway to look over the edge of what we call the pixie stix. A bunch of trees that had been fallen by previous owners stacked on the side of the hill like pixie stix. We noticed something had been moving logs and stumps around. Probably a bear though we saw one stump out of place for a bear. It had been pulled straight up out of the ground tap root and all still intact. No sign of the rocking motion that a bear does to remove roots. No claw marks. So we looked around for bear tracks and really didn't find much. We went back to the truck and continued to the top of the hill removing trees and branches with the chainsaw to get through. When we got there we removed some more branches and scoped the area for our cabin all the while there was something staying just out of visual contact but walking around behind us on the neighbor lot. We left when we were done. We went back down the hill and started up another road that my husband had built with our dozer a few months earlier, as we started up the road which is not that long, I was startled when I was looking at a tree that I didn't remember was there and it turned and quickly moved out of sight to the left. I yelled at my husband asking him what that was? he said ""what?"" I asked him if he saw it, he said no. The branch about 8-9 ft above the ground was still moving rapidly from where the head, I assume it was the head, hit it (I saw that happen). He stopped next to where it was and we could not see anything. We continued up farther on the road and got out and I was talking to him and he said to hush. He had heard something about a minute or two later just as he literally started  to say ""ok I heard a ""woop"" just once. Again he was talking so I did not hear it. He wasn't believing that I saw something. So we looked around this area for another possible cabin site. After about 20 - 25 minutes we went back down to the bottom of the hill (home). That night we started hearing things. This time hubby heard it too. Later that evening when we went to bed and lights were out there was banging on the side of our cabin and then a short time later things were hitting our cabin. Not rocks really don't have any around so it had to be sticks. My husband is a believer now. He was scared. I'm nervous to go outside when I'm here by myself. The next day I did go out and look for footprints around our cabin and found a huge print behind our cabin but it was an older print. It looked like a huge flat footed huge toed person. I showed my husband and he started looking in the area and found another it looked about the same age. So my husband has been leaving food out for it but we don't know what is taking the food. We think maybe due to the fires here in Washington they are on the move but we also have been hearing strange howl/growl sounds that are very loud for months. Our cat would always be in the same area as the sounds as if it was talking to our cat. Yesterday something went after my chickens and so there was a lot of commotion and then I kept hearing branches breaking and woop woop sounds. What do we do?"

It is a very forested area that does eventually connect with the Olympic rain forest, however, it is also a populated area. He witnessed a 7-8 foot creature, walk from the side of the road into the forest. He stated it was not thin, as thick as a tree trunk, but, what is even more puzzling, is that he has stated that it was a light grey or whitish color and Very Very ""hairy."""

We turned right at the Roy Y Going south. It was 5:15am. We were going south. We observed and exclaimed, ""that looks like an ape sitting on the side of the road. The animal was about three feet high in a sitting, crouched position. We were going south from left to right. We saw its left arm shoulder to elbow, left leg hip to knee, lower leg obscured. The head was larger with a sagital crest. Lantern shaped jaw that protruded slightly forward. The nose looked wide. And it had a protruding eyebrow like a Neanderthal. Its ears were covered in black hair tight to the head. No visible neck. Still going left to right, we can clearly see, shiny black hair. The animal leaned forward head going low, could see top of both black haired ears. Our distance at this point is between 22 to 25 feet. The animal extends its right arm from the shoulder parallel to the ground and drops some trash from its hands. The arm had black hair all the way to the knuckles. The arm was to long to be human. When it dropped the trash, a thumb and four fingers were clearly visible.The animal moved its right arm back in front of its torso, ninety degrees of angle. Not a bear. It did this action twice. Still going left to right, the right arm from shoulder to elbow is visible, below the right arm, between right arm and right leg, right leg visible from top of buttocks to hip to knee, partially covered by green plastic garbage bag. We estimate its overall height to be between five foot six inches to six feet tall. We said moma-squatch would not leave baby that close to the road. As we lost sight of it we knew it was a juvenile Bigfoot."

At first I thought it couldn't be a Sasquatch, there are people at the lodge. But as I looked again it's whole body was covered in shaggy auburn hair. I then thought it couldn't be a person, I've never seen anyone wear a snow suit that looks like that."
57781,Report 57781: Couple visiting the Hoh River rainforest see a sasquatch cross the road near Bogachiel,Class A,2017-02-25T12:00:00Z,47.82243,-124.195,2017,Washington,57781.0,"My name is Tim. My wife Nan and I live between Newberg and Wilsonville, OR. On February 24, 2016 we decided to take a couple of days off and drive up to the Olympic Peninsula. We drove up to Olympia, WA and took Hwy 101 route along the Hood Canal to through Port Angeles to Forks, where we stayed the night at the Forks Motel. Early on the morning of February 25th (a Thursday) we drove south on Hwy 101 to Upper Hoh Road and east to the Hoh Rain Forest. It was a beautiful clear and dry day, which was unusual for February on the Peninsula. After an enjoyable walk through the Rain Forest we headed back west on Upper Hoh Road. There was very little traffic in either direction and we pretty much had the road to ourselves. Approximately halfway back to Hwy 101, where the road once again comes close to the Hoh River, we had just cleared a corner and were at the beginning of a straight stretch of road which I estimate to be about 1/4-mile long before there was a left-hand corner. At the end of that straight stretch we both saw a very large bipedal creature walk out of the woods on the north side of the road, stride across the road in three strides, and disappear into the woods on the south side of the road. It appeared to be 7-8' tall and covered in dark hair. We both looked at each other in astonishment with that ""Did you see what I just saw?"" look on our faces. Without making comment of my own I asked Nan to describe what she had just seen, and her description was exactly the same as mine. When we got to that spot where we had seen the creature appear from the woods we stopped and examined the site. The road was in an area that was still within the Olympic National Forest, and the woods were so thick on each side of the road that it was difficult to see more than a few feet into the woods to the north. The trees were just as thick on the south side of the road, but we could tell that we were very close to the Hoh River. There was no trail whatsoever coming out of the woods or going into the woods on the south side of the road. Under the circumstances we could only surmise that we had just seen a Bigfoot that was apparently going across the road to reach the river. Even though I never doubted the existence of Bigfoot, I always considered myself a ""Professional Skeptic"". Yes it most certainly could exist, especially here in the Pacific Northwest where there are still enormous tracts of land that are virtually unexplored, but I would prefer to see proof of it myself prior to confirmation. I am now a confirmed believer, as is Nan. We never told anyone about it, and it wasn't until last night when we were watching a rerun of your show where you did an investigation in the Olympic Rainforest that we were reminded of the event. After the show we decided that I should send an email to you to apprise you of our sighting."

It was a clear night and so my 14 year old daughter and I got out to walk and to look for hot spots. Well we heard some loud grunts and we turned to look but it was hard to see so I had my husband turn the headlights on and we all saw three, very ugly hairy hairy people. One was about 7 to 8 foot, the other was about 7 ft but it wasn't as hairy and the little little one was about the size of a kid, age range from 7 to 9 years. Well the big one took its arm and raised it and did a half circle motion. It made the most fierce noise and we took off."

It was about 9pm in the evening and we were scanning the clear cut with our flashlights when we first saw the eyeshine in the distance approximately 150 to 200yards. We saw 3 pairs of eye shine and at different heights thinking at first we are seeing  a mother bear and cubs but after shining our flashlights in their direction the larger creature charged up the hill along the tree line grunting and hollering then stopped and waited for the other 2.  Thats when we got our flashlights on it and it was large and brown. Then the larger one turned into the woods heading towards us breaking down branches and saplings then it just stopped and everything went silent.  As my dad and I sat there the other 2 sat on the edge of the tree line just watching us they walked around a bit but every time we made a noise they would stop what they were doing and just watched us. The eyeshine was an orangeish glow. It also seemed as if one was small cause you would see its head pop up behind stumps and logs, this went on for 3 hours. At about midnight the larger creature came out from the tree line. We got our flashlights on it.  That's when my dad and I  saw this creature step over a log and proceed to walk down hill on 2 legs and that's when the other 2 followed it. I hollered at it and you could see it turn and look at us and you could see the head bob just like when a person is walking down hill. You should know there are no brown bears on Sumas mountain. a"
63451,"Report 63451: Sickly sasquatch observed by farmhand around 5am, 5 min outside Everson",Class A,2017-01-21T12:00:00Z,48.90147,-122.3347,2017,Washington,63451.0,"I was living in Whatcom County 5 minutes from the small town of Everson, WA. I worked on a dairy farm out in Custer, WA. I had to be work at 6:00 AM to feed calves, however, I did my best to get there a half-hour early just in case a cow had a calf in the night so that I could tag it, Vac it, tube it and move it before the other calves woke up for their morning feed. I got out of bed at 4 AM and got ready to go, ate a small breakfast, and left the house at 5:05 AM to head for the farm. As I started down my road I got a funny feeling. I came to a Stop sign and got ready to turn when I caught sight of movement in the headlights. At first I thought that a deer was preparing to jump over the blackberries and onto the road until I focused on what it was I was looking at. The creature blinked and reached up its hand to grasp a limb of a tree. It was sickly skinny! It’s elbow joints protruded, and I could see the clavicle bone and the shoulders had a dip between where the arm connected to the body. I could see a massive rib cage and a sickly sunken stomach on this animal. I could see the tops of this animal’s pelvic bone protruding. It had a very clear thigh gap. The sides of the head were sunken in on either side and the face was gaunt with high cheekbones. The animal leaned against the tree it was holding onto for support. I was shocked and scared, but I knew what I was seeing was real. So I tried to take in as much as I could. The animal didn’t seem too keen on moving. He just stood there staring back at my car like deer in the headlights. It was anywhere from 8’5” to 8’9” tall and about 3'6"" wide (I came back and measured a week later based on the tree branch it held on to). It was covered in dark medium length fur with patches of gray around the face and peppered throughout the body. It’s head road low to the shoulders with very little neck showing, and it’s eyes glowed yellowish greenish white in the headlights. It’s head had a high cranial ridge, making it look pin headed for lack of a better word. Its arms were very long with the fingers of the creature just above the knee. Its eyes were forward facing and quite round and deep set with a broad, protruding forehead. It’s nose was flat, with a thin lipped slightly protruding mouth like a gorilla but not as angled with the mouth. Its face had deep set wrinkles. Thinking back now I believe this poor animal didn’t have the energy to run. He just stood there staring back at me. I finally decided to turn onto the road and head to work. As I hit the gas going towards this creature he startled and bared his teeth at me. I know from documentaries that when a monkey bares it’s teeth it is a sign of aggression. The thing that struck me is that its mouth was missing a bottom canine and the rest of them were worn nearly flat. The other teeth were chipped with a few broken close to the gums and nearly gone. I hit the gas at that point because I was turning left and had to go right past this animal within about 10 to 15 feet of it. The reason I didn’t report this sooner was because I was worried how people would react, and also I wondered what this animal was doing there in the first place. After thinking it through, it hit me. There was a chicken farm in the area. I truly believe this Sasquatch was older and starving to death. It happened to be a really awful Winter, with the most snow that part of Washington had seen in 20 years, with several ice storms, and heavy snows and with temperatures plummeting into the low teens. I think it had come down from the foot hills into the town outskirts to try to snatch a few chickens as an easy meal. I think I surprised him, thinking that no humans would be out that early in the morning. A week later I saw the chicken owner while I was walking my dog. I asked how their chickens were and they told me that the week before, they believed that a few coyotes had gotten in and had snatched two of their hens that were sleeping in the outdoor shelter. There is a thick dense forest that goes on for miles straight up into the mountains. It is home to deer, black bear, coyotes, and the occasional mountain lion. I was born and raised in Montana. I hunt and fish and I have seen a lot of animals both wild and domestic. I am also a huge animal lover and have watched countless documentaries on every animal you can think of. So believe me when I say that I know animals and what I saw was not cougar nor was it a bear. I have seen them both in the wild, in zoos, and on documentaries. I would not miss identifying a bear for what I saw."

I would estimate it's height in the 7 ft 6 inch plus range but it was skinny. I was resting after rafting and hiking in approximately 1 mile down a trail.  This is a calmer stretch of the White Salmon River watching other kayakers go by occasionally. Here the river is usually no more than 2 ft deep.  After a period with no kayakers, about 30 mins, I watched what I can only describe as a Sasquatch or Bigfoot walk out of the woods about 80 yards away on the opposite side of the river and cross the river. It was coming slightly in my direction as it crossed.  I was startled (terrified) and had my camera phone on me but realized I could not open the camera app likely in time to get a pic or video, so I observed it closely for the dozen or so seconds it took to cross the river. As I said, at least 7.5 ft or taller, based on the fact that I could see its head at or above the trees on the riverbank that it went though. The hominid was covered in very black hair, with noticable bare areas across the chest and hip area. Also less hair under the armpit. The hair on its head was also black and looked very much like shorter dreadlocks. I could see the nose and lips (very humanlike) but not the eyes.  It crossed the river not in a great hurry, but just like wanted to get out of the open. I believe it saw me at its closest approach (about 50 yards) because it turned its body slightly in my direction and that is when I could see the face, nose, lips. It crossed the river, went through the trees, and then I could hear it going up a large embankment. I was shocked and had an almost overwhelming sense of fear and would not talk about it for a while. I talked with an old timer lady in the area. She was confident I had seen one of their ""teenagers""  They're tall and skinny just like ours she said. ________________________________________________"

I immediately thought of what I just saw & my conclusion was a bigfoot. It was vertical & on a slight angle as it was ready to go into the woods. It was heading g north. I could see the width of legs & its body shape only but I was at too far a distance to make out hair or face. There  was nothing to abstruct my view because what was in back of him was shoulder and the road that continued West which also went up to a hill I only saw it because I crested over the hill it was plain as day what it was until he disappeared into the woods. I immediately called my husband and he got to the site I described approximately 45 minutes later. He reported seeing something had jumped and made a clearing into a small snow bank and also reported seeing some sort of tracks going along a deer trail which led to a deer carcass. The deer also had no front legs they were snapped off at the knees

He said it was seen the same time the year before on the ice age trail, about a quarter mile from his house."
63091,Report 63091: Sasquatch sighting by motorists along South Turcott Road six miles north of Tripoli,Class A,2019-07-09T12:00:00Z,45.63092,-90.02283,2019,Wisconsin,63091.0,"On Sunday, July 07, 2019, my brother, sister and I took an excursion through Northern Wisconsin.  We were traveling north on South Turcott Road, approximately 6.5 miles north of Tripoli, WI.  Turcott is a rough, gravel road and we were traveling approximately 10-15 mph in a Chevy Suburban.  My brother was driving, I was in the front passenger seat, and our sister was in the right rear passenger seat. The day was clear and cool.  Our windows were rolled up because the deer flies were very thick.  As we drove through the forest, we came to a clearing to our right, on the east side of the road.  The clearing had a lot of brush and fallen logs as it had been logged off.  Across the clearing to our east, approximately 100-150 yards away, the forest began again. I was looking out across the clearing when I saw a large, reddish-brown, upright figure running along the edge of the trees in the distance.  It seemed to be hunched over as it ran.  It was too large to be a deer, and did not have a proper height, or gait, for a bear.  I only saw it for a moment before my view was obstructed by brush.  I wasn’t sure what I saw so I turned to my brother and said, “I think I just saw…”  At that moment, he abruptly stopped the vehicle and pointed out my window and yelled, “THERE!!!”  My sister and I both looked, but it was gone. I asked my brother what he saw and he said it was a big, hairy, reddish-brown figure with no neck, nor muzzle - thick, and too tall to be a deer.  He said it was standing upright on the edge of the woods.  He estimated it to be about six feet in height and he said he saw it look over its shoulder before it ran into the woods.  He also said the smaller trees moved aside like it was pushing its way into the woods. After he told me what he saw, I told him that what I saw was exactly the same color and I’d have described it exactly the same way: Big, hairy, reddish-brown, and hunched over."

This figure was standing right next to a tree on the south side of the road close to the shoulder.  The road is curvy in this area.  He said he also caught eye shine and the eyes were large.  We said he probably saw this for about 3 seconds while driving.  His headlights caught this and he is 100% positive he saw something.  He said his heart dropped and he immediately called me while still driving.  I knew something unique happened based on his demeanor and tone. About 45 minutes after he called me I met him at home and went back to the site with him. We brought our dog.  Every time we stopped or approached this area where the sighting was he started to whimper and would not get any closer.

I went squirrel hunting and saw one go up a tree. I grabbed a stick and started to hit the tree to see if I can get the squirrel to move out of the tree. I sat there for a few minutes and walked off. I walked away from the tree and heard some knocks off in the distances. I thought it was some thing else so I kept on going. I walked for a few more minutes and I looked back. There was something behind a tree looking at me. It was about eight to nine feet tall. I had no idea what to do, so I ran away."

After that the road goes into a ""s"" turn which is probably a mile or so in length. Coming into the last right hand part of the s turn, I saw what I first thought was a man running from the left to the right across the highway. I thought, ""what is this guy doing running across the highway out here?"" I could see shoulders moving and arms swinging. It was upright and fast, but I couldn't see any other detail from my distance. It just seemed really dark brown or black. I couldn't make out shoes or clothing or skin. Whatever it was, it did not slow down once it had made it across the road. It continued at the same speed into the trees. I slowed down almost to a stop where it appeared to enter the trees.

I thought nothing of it until his arm stretched out behind him and I was like no way is that human.  It was very, very tall, medium to dark gray, and just didn't seem like a person.

75162,Report 75162: Kayakers report camp intimidation all night long on Lower Buffalo River,Class B,2022-09-09T12:00:00Z,36.09306,-92.45677,2022,Arkansas,75162.0,"On September 8, 2022 my son and I packed up to go kayak-camping the Lower Buffalo River. We planned a three night trip as we would take our time as we were fishing. We drove for about 6 or 7 hours and finally arrived. We put in at Rush and only went about four miles that afternoon and just soaked up the beauty. We made camp and enjoyed a peaceful night.  On September 9, 2022 we started the day at first light. We knew that we wanted to camp close to Big Creek to keep on schedule, so we fished all day and simply enjoyed the day. By late afternoon it was hot but not too hot. I believe the temp was somewhere around 83-85 degrees and a somewhat clear day with low humidity. At approximately 4:00 pm, I believe we had stopped fishing and were looking for a good campsite as we were getting close to Big Creek. I believe that there was some type of obstruction or a cut to the left where we weren’t paddling but simply letting the river push us. We were quiet and not talking, just quietly floating.  At [36.0931117, -92.4756105] which was to our left, at approximately 20 yards away we heard what can best be described as a pissed off monkey. Literally sounded like a monkey as it ripped away at whatever was in its path as it went away from the river. It was still making the pissed off monkey sounds as it tore through the woods. We both looked surprised and asked what the hell was that as we started paddling away from the location. We joked about the sound and just wanted to put a little distance between us and the pissed off monkey. This occurred just north of Big Creek approximately 1.29 miles.  We paddled about 2.78 river miles from the pissed off monkey and stopped on the river left at a small gravel bar to make camp, at 36.0930645, -92.4567744 The gravel bar wasn’t that wid, and was approximately 15-20 yards long but was in good shade. Our goal this afternoon was to find a good shaded area where we wouldn’t cook as the sun went behind the ridge. Since there was no rain forecast we figured we were good.  Also, the water had been dropping all day. We went into full camp mode and started to get everything set up. That’s when we heard the first wood knock. We both stopped what we were doing and looked towards the knock. From our camp it was from the ridge line across the river from us and north up the ridge, a little down river. I looked at my son and said that was a dang wood knock. Now, we joked earlier that the pissed off monkey sound could have been an ole squatch but we were joking. I actually believed my son said that a bear can make some crazy sounds like that when surprised. Regardless, we have now just heard a tree knock, no doubt about that. We both made some sly comments jokingly about it and continued to set up camp. Our camp was on a narrow gravel and rock bar that was approximately 15-20 yards wide. We had a clear field of view up and down the river. Our two tents were set up about 20 feet from the tree line with the tents only being about 12 feet apart. The fire was directly in front of both tents and split the difference from the tents and the water. We had two kayaks pulled completely out of the water to our front right.  Once camp was set we jumped in the river for a little while and knocked the day’s grime off. After that we walked the rock bar and  fished for a very short time and then gathered enough wood to have a fire that would last us until we hit the sack. We then settled in by a fire and just talked about the day. At approximately 8:00 pm the night started creeping in and I grabbed my weather radio to check the weather since rain was supposed to move in the next day. We sat around and listened to two regional reports and clicked it off. It was immediately after that that all hell would break loose and would last until 4:00 am.  As if from on que, we heard a yell “aaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh” that came from the ridge line close to where the tree knock was earlier. That freaked us out! We immediately jumped up at the same time and walked towards the water where the campfire smoke wouldn’t block our view. We started looking in the general area and began talking about what the hell would or even could make that noise. We then started asking ourselves if someone could be up on the ridge messing with us. Doubtful based on the location and terrain. We were, after all, in the wilderness. The yell was extremely loud and deep and sounded pissed. It wasn’t no time after that, in fact my son was still standing up, that we heard a noise coming from our rear but it was higher pitched and I couldn’t make it out but it had a melody to it. I stood up and looked at my son and asked what the hell was that? He said, you don’t want to know what I heard. And of course I said I do. He said it sounded like a woman singing. Now that really freaked me out but freaked my son out more because he could actually hear it better. We immediately both went to our tents and retrieved our handguns without a word being spoken. My concern was that now something was on our side of the river and I didn’t like that idea at all.  I immediately began lighting up our camp. I wasn’t sure what was going on but I didn’t have a good feeling about any of it. I had 3 pop up led lanterns, a battery operated canopy string led light, and chemlights. I strung the string light up behind the tents at the woodline, placed one popup lantern between the tents, one to our right and one to our left. The fire was to our front and I tied a Chemlight to a fishing pole on each kayak. Once we had a lighted perimeter set we began gathering all the wood we could possibly gather and settled in listening more than talking.  Between 9:00 - 9:30 pm the first rock of the evening came flying off the ridge and landed in the river to our left -- close to where the first tree knock came from but further towards the front of our position. I’m not talking about a small rock, I mean cantaloupe size. We both jumped up and walked to the edge of the water with flashlights and pistols. We scanned the ridge but didn’t see anything. It was then that I told my son that this thing is pissed and wants us out of here. We sat back down and discussed our options. We can’t run the Buffalo River at night on a section that we’ve never seen before. We literally don’t know what’s around the next bend. We have no choice but to hunker down and prepare the best we can. We went and gathered more wood. Once we gathered all that we could we sat down and discussed what we would do. I told my son that he would sleep first but to drag his cot out of his tent and place it between the fire and one of the perimeter lights. He would sleep for 2 hours while I pulled fire watch and then we would swap.  At 10:30 pm my son settled in to sleep as I started my first watch. At approximately 10:45 pm I heard a tree knock that was close to the same location as the first tree knock. However, immediately after the knock, and for the first time since the initial contact, I heard the pissed off monkey sounds. It seemed more ramped up than the first. The pissed off monkey was further down the ridge and to the north but close to the end of the ridge and the river. I then got worried because this thing wasn’t far from the other gravel bar that we could see from camp. It could easily cross the river and come in on a flanking move or come to our rear. At approximately 10:50 pm, immediately across from us and on top of the ridge, I heard a very very deep chatter/mumble vocalization. I immediately recognized the sounds from the Sierra Sounds. Same Samurai sound but seemed deeper. It was at that time that I realized that we were in trouble. With the pissed off monkey making his way down the ridge and the Samurai sounds, my stomach turned. I started doing notes on my phone because I was actually afraid that something was going to happen if we didn’t leave. I figured that we were possibly at our last stand location and the night was not going to end well. I had to make the decision to start doing notes to make sure that someone would read what happened in the event everything went bad. I also did a video of the campsite and how everything was set up, along with my son sleeping. In my gut I felt that we didn’t have a chance in hell. We were trapped with our backs to the river and the ridge. We had no way to get the hell out of there and no way to call for help due to no cellphone service. Continuing with my watch, at approximately 11:45 pm I heard chattering in the same location as the first tree knocks and at 12:30 am my watch ended. I woke my son and gave him all this information. I also advised him to watch our rear because the pissed off monkey may be trying to work his way to our rear. I racked out. My son woke me up for my second watch and passed on his information. He said he heard the pissed off monkey and a rock thrown into the river. Then later he heard a tree knock. He advised that all this took place directly across the river from camp.  At 2:45 am, the last watch began. I had to go out and try to find firewood because we weren’t going to have enough to last through the night. I was able to scavenge some within the wood line but had to make multiple trips due to having only one hand free, the pistol was in the other. At approximately 3:17 am I heard a deep pissed off monkey sound immediately across from camp on the ridge that was immediately followed up with yet another rock thrown into the river. At approximately 3:26 am I heard deep chattering halfway down the ridge that actually scared the hell out of me because it was coming down closer. At approximately 3:32 am I heard a tree snap to my rear. It was the sound of good firewood that you put on your knee and you snap it in half except this sounded like a log that got snapped. I jumped up, pointed my pistol in the general direction and woke my son, he slept through it. I explained to him what just happened and he armed himself. While facing the treeline we slowly backed up to the fire as we scanned the area. I didn’t hear anything run off and best I could tell it was about 20 yards behind the tree line and up the ridge. While backed up to the fire and on guard, I started running through the events that happened while I was on watch. We both came to the realization that things were escalating and we had to do something.  After a brief discussion we decided that we had to do something to show we had intention to leave. We decided that we would start breaking down camp and pack everything into the kayaks. We did just that. It did not take us long at all and before no time the kayaks were loaded and all that was left were our chairs, water bottles and the lighted perimeter. At approximately 4:00 AM we had the fire blazing and sat down. Not long after we sat down my son said did you hear that and I said no but then I heard something that sounded like a laugh. I looked at my son and said what the hell. He said he heard one whistle and pointed to our right and across the river. Then he pointed to our left and said another one was laughing at us from across the river. The whistle I did not hear.  We sat there in our chairs until sunrise with no further activities. Right before first light we began gathering up everything and finalized our packing. As soon as we walked to our kayaks to push them off, a rock came off the ridge, hit a tree on the way down and hit the water in front of us. I shouted we were leaving and we did just that. We paddled about 12 miles straight to the White River where we came out at Riley’s Outfitters. Neither one of us said a word about this to anyone we encountered at the Outfitters. Needless to say, our trip was cut short but we were good with that. After we returned home I battled with the thought of contacting the Ranger Station at Buffalo Point. I knew that this story was going to sound crazy but I would have felt guilty if I read something later on about a family being hurt on that section of the river and I never said anything. So, on September 11, 2022 I started using my law enforcement contacts in an effort to speak directly with a Ranger on the Buffalo. All the information was passed along through a contact and I was advised that I would receive a phone call. That call came a few days later and all the information was passed along. I was advised that an investigation would take place at the coordinates that I released and that I would be contacted if any further information was needed."
45652,Report 45652: Late-night frog hunters experience possible territorial behavior north of Rimrock,Class B,2014-06-29T12:00:00Z,34.67245,-111.7099,2014,Arizona,45652.0,"My 15 year old son, my friend and I were out frog gigging in a creek off of rd 179 near Sedona and I-17 in Az. This took place on 06-29-2014 at 1240 am. We entered the creek which is knownas beaver creek. We all had our gigs and 100 lumen lights. And were walking up stream after we entered the canyon in which the creek was located. As we entered the canyon I noticed a wrong musky, stinky smell, but I did not say anything because this could have been skunk or javelin which is common in the area. After walking for about 200 yards, my son who was in front stopped and said he heard something walking away from him up the creek. I asked if it was a deer or elk. He told me he could not see because of the under brush, but said it sound like a heavy person. We continued for a few more feet and we all then observed three large rocks thrown from the thick brush above are heads, about 20 yards in front of us over the creek to the opposite side. We all stopped and then heard branches crashing as something crossed the creek in front of us. We looked in all direction with our lights but the brush and trees were too thick to see. I stopped and hit my gig against a tree three times. We then heard branches breaking up stream. We then crossed the creek and stopped. A rock was then thrown toward us and landed in the creek 5 yards in front of us. I advised my son and my friend we need to go, but as we turned to go back out, something very large ran toward us from up the creek bottom in the thick bushes, breaking large branches. We searched with our lites but could not see anything. We then walked out and made it back to the truck."

As we drove up snow bowl rd to reach the Arizona Snowbowl, we saw a large tall figure walking in long strides through the trees. I would say about 40 yards from the desolate road. As an avid ""Finding Bigfoot"" watcher, our sighting was everything we heard/saw on the show. The squatch had to have been at least 8 or 9 feet tall. It was too far away to make out any features, but the way it walked, the posture, and dark brown/black color it was unmistakeable. Definitely not a bear or deer. We saw the creature take two long strides through the trees and ""disappear"". A feeling came over us of shock/fear/amazement. I had goosebumps all over my body."
55195,Report 55195: Camper has a possible afternoon sighting at USFS campground near the town of Strawberry,Class B,2016-06-26T12:00:00Z,34.43542,-111.3164,2016,Arizona,55195.0,"It was a Sunday afternoon in late June 2016. I was camped in a developed USFS campground (CG) on the Coconino National Forest in central Arizona in the Mogollon Rim area. The CG is situated in an canyon within a mixed forest of spruce, fir, oak, aspen, and mainly Ponderosa pine. The cliff edge of the Rim is about 3/4 mile South of the CG. I was sitting in the shade and had just finished reading a work of fiction by James Patterson which had a strange ending. I was musing about the ending and just looking West across the CG when a very fast moving dark figure crossed the CG heading from North to South. My first thought was of a large kid on a bicycle as it was moving so fast on the in camp gravel road. But its' travel path was counter to the road. Then I realized what it was that I had seen. It was a very large Bigfoot. The sighting only lasted about three seconds and I was very lucky to have seen it at all. It crossed the CG in a shaded area and blended well into its' background but the meadow beyond it to the West was bathed in afternoon Sunlight and backlit the dark figure. It was about 125 yards from my viewpoint so facial detail was not clear. It ran with a slight forward cant to its' body. I noted that the head did not bob up and down like a human runners head at speed. The coat was almost black looking but with the back lighting I noticed a slight reddish tint to the figures profile as it passed by. I had not noticed its legs or arm movement. Later, I went over to where the figure had crossed. On the North side of the drainage area, there was an area of crushed grass near the beginning of the travel path. Then the figure had moved South across the in camp road and had gone into a depression in the high grass. There were other areas of crushed grass along its' suspected travel path. Also a crushed fern near the split rail fence that bordered the CG where I suspect it had stepped over, crossed the forest road, and went into thick timber. I believe the Earth depression and a row of large logs obscurred my view of its'legs as it passed by. I had only seen its' torso from the hips up but did note that the figure did not appear to have much of a neck, if any. The torso was very thick and I guessed it was a least twice the thickness of a human. It was a once in a lifetime event and as I said, I was very lucky to have seen the Sasquatch at all. Truly, an awesome event which I will carry in my minds eye forever."
47165,Report 47165: Two campers take photos of what they see in the trees in the El Dorado National Forest,Class B,2014-07-15T12:00:00Z,38.77386,-120.4036,2014,California,47165.0,"I live in the ""Bay Area"" of California. My visual sighting is at the bottom of this report. I have photos of that I want to send. I enjoy hiking and camping on a regular basis year round. I have been considering submitting a report for my encounter over the last few months and finally I am doing it. My encounter happened about 4 months ago in July. My girlfriend and I were ""dispersed camping"" (which is where campers can legally set up a tent in the national forest for free for up to 14 days) in El Dorado National Forest off of Hwy 50, about 6 miles east of Bridal Veil Falls. We have a secluded spot we always return to on the bank of a 10-15 foot wide, 4-5 feet deep (at the deepest) river. Some time in the night, probably 1-4 AM, my girlfriend woke me up saying she heard someone jumping into the river about 50 feet away, and it sounded like the person's legs were sloshing against the water the way it would sound if you were walking fast through thigh-deep water. Sure enough, a few seconds after she whispered this to me, I heard the noise too. She was accurate in her description of the sound. I guess my protective instincts kicked in because without hesitation I unzipped the tent with my large mag-light in hand, (the type police officers use) and stood outside my tent, spotlighting the river bank and the forest around us. I saw nothing, so I called out that there were people and please go the other way, still heard nothing. After that we didn't hear any more unusual sounds. What struck me as odd was, why would anyone be walking in FREEZING cold (likely glacier run-off) water in the dark morning hours, not anywhere near any trails, and not anywhere near any roads...? (We had to hike to this spot and it's a mile from our car, down a very steep heavily forested hillside full of underbrush, which is why this spot was so hard to find and it was an accidental find, and why it stays secluded.) It had me pondering for the last few months and even brought me to considering maybe it was a bigfoot because it sounded like two legs, not the way a bear would sound trudging through the water. Plus, there was nothing in the river I could see so whoever or whatever would've had to be farther than we thought and therefor very large to make sound seem so close... The next morning we went for a long hike as it was our last day camping. We had just gotten back to the car when I looked back at the treeline we had just came out of a, sort of, for a last glance, I will miss you, type of look, and I saw what I first thought was a black bear in the very top (the literal tip) of a 60-70 foot pine tree, it was staying still but I could see it was wiggling a little, almost like it was positioning itself comfortably, and it looked like it was hugging the tree like a bear. But then I saw the second ""bear"" in the SAME spot as this one in a tree right next to it. At this point I'm about 500 feet from these things and the trees they were in. I was able to take many photos of these ""bears"" and I have them on my phone and will send them to anyone who wants to see. On closer inspection, these were not bears. I showed a few friends and family and they all see what I see, it appears there is a UNIFORM Jet Black sillouette of a large, lean human man. When you see these pictures you will get an off/odd feeling. I know they weren't bears and I know they weren't humans. I'm not sure what they were, but I know what they were not. After viewing them for about a minute my girlfriend began to get a bit worried they might come down, so we left. And we didn't talk about it much as she isn't interested in the subject.

We had killed a deer and had the carcass out back of camp. during the night about 2 a.m. my son, daughter-in-law and my grandson first heard sounds of rocks or big stones being thrown or dropped. Then they started hearing knocking noises like someone hitting trees with a bat followed by a low growl ending in a high pitched scream. This went on for about 15 min. At this time I was awakened by a a noise. I wasn't sure what it was and I thought a bear was after the deer. I jumped up and my son said something was screaming outside. I ran out with a flash light and could see nothing.  I was looking for a bear or eye shine  I got one single eyeshine about 7 or 8 ft off the ground when I panned back it was gone. I thought maybe a raccoon. But when the family told me what they heard I knew it was not a coon and tried to make them think it was a bear. The next morning when I went to check nothing had been touched but a very large pine tree next to the deer had been pushed nearly completely over. I have been an hunter and outdoors man all my life but have no answer for this. Just thought you would like to know because it happened so recently"
59668,Report 59668: Boater spots something odd during the day on Lake Shasta,Class B,2014-07-15T12:00:00Z,40.7729,-122.1024,2014,California,59668.0,This happened back around 2014 although I didn't realize it until I read something about it. I was on Shasta Lake riding my Sea Doo one last time before I sold it. I had headed up the Pit river sometime in July. It was approximately sometime after 2 PM.  I had gone up quite a ways up toward the pot river and had decided to head back toward Jones Valley resort.  I always love to scan the ridges looking for shapes like you do when you hunt.  I came around a big  turn in the main channel and it was the most bizarre thing I had ever seen. About 20 feet from shore I see what I initially believed to be a big hairy head with eyes staring directly at me. I would say within a couple seconds it simply disappeared under the surface of the water. I was wearing sunglasses and I remember thinking  did I just see what I think I did?  I gave it a wide girth and slowed down and circled the area for about 2-3 minutes. I remember feeling freaked out a bit having this vision of it lunging out of the water at me.  Shortly after I continued back to Jones Valley resort and tried to put it out of my head. I wish now more than ever I would have taken the time to search for it but I just figured my initial thought had to be incorrect. I reasoned naturally it had to be something else. A beaver? Muskrat? I can't say for sure what it was but I know it was big. I do know my original feeling was it was a big hairy head and face with eyes. It had appeared to be wet already like it had already submerged previously. It was dark brown and tan in color. I know it was not a human. There were no boats anywhere near where I was and it was pretty secluded.

63560,Report 63560: Whoops and knocks at campground near Julian,Class B,2019-10-20T12:00:00Z,33.03662,-116.5645,2019,California,63560.0,"We went camping for a couple nights near Julian, CA. in a location just a couple miles south of town adjacent to Hwy 79. We arrived on a Friday night and stayed thru Sunday afternoon. We were sharing a tent trailer with friends. Both mornings before dawn I walked my wife over to the nearby porta-potty/restroom. Both nights were clear and quite dark with partial moonlight but the area has a lot of trees so there are shadows even though you can see well enough to walk over to the restrooms without a flashlight. The first morning we walked over to the bathroom without incident and it's very quiet there, especially in the evenings. The second morning probably about 0540 as I waited for my wife I very clearly heard a tree knock. It came from north of our location. When my wife came out of the restroom I told her what I heard and asked her if she heard it. She did not. We walked back to the tent trailer and got back in bed as the sun was not rising until closer to 0700. We were both awake about 15 minutes later and both heard a single whoop sound this time from a bit to the east. Right after the whoop sound was heard there were blue jays in the trees around us that went nuts making all kinds of noise for about 20 seconds then all was quiet again. A bit later, still before dark, I got up and kindled the fire a bit outside and decided to take my vehicle up the road to drop some trash off near the campground office. Another friend from a second tent trailer also camping with us was up at this time. I told her about the tree knock and whoop that was heard. When I returned from the quick errand to the trash bin. She told me she had also heard a tree knock, but this time it was to our west. A few minutes later I heard 2 more whoops one from the south east then a couple minutes after that to the south. These were not coyotes yipping. Not sure what else to say about it but it was interesting!"
63645,Report 63645: Mattole River Watershed (Lost Coast region) resident reporting loud knocks and vocalizations.,Class B,2019-11-02T12:00:00Z,40.01142,-123.9122,2019,California,63645.0,"You would be interested in what happened to me a year ago, and twice more in 24 hours, just 2 weeks ago, near the Humboldt Mendo County headwaters of the Matole River. I am absolutely convinced that some unknown animal exists here so I began on the internet a search for similar accounts.  While immersed in the Internet searching it became clear to me that your organization should have this most recent information in a timely manner. Last July 2018, I was staying in a very isolated region, which had very limited access, behind 3 locked gates and 20 miles south of Whitethorn, CA, on a primitive 4x4 road.  This place is at the end of the world, on the northern border of a vast green belt spreading from Shelter Cove on the coast, east to Highway 101,  and south to Fort Bragg, and east to Piercy, as can be seen on Google Earth. About 3 a.m. I was awake, it was a hot and dark night in these mountains.  Something above my tent location, approximately 200-300 meters, began knocking on wood, best described as loud whacks on a tree trunk by a big club or branch.  It started with one knock, which got my attention, with a brief hesitation, then several more knocks, but randomly timed, some in succession, others after hesitations.  The knocking was loud, so loud that it echoed down the canyon. The event lasted only a minute or two. My first thoughts were that there was no one on the mountain who could be out here in the middle of a primitive and protected area.  These knocks were obviously from something large, and no North American animal could have made them.  I listened intently while my mind tried to wrap around how the noise was made.  The woods were silent, not even a cricket.  I told a few locals afterward and learned that there were other hotspots for squatch sightings between Piercy and up to Willow Creek. Flash forward to two weeks ago, when waiting at the first locked gate to this same conservation area, I heard two distinct vocalizations which cannot be explained. As I waited in the dusk for about 45 minutes, waiting to meet a party at the gate who were running late, I heard a very loud wail/ scream/ call that I've never heard before in nature.  The call of this thing I located at about my 2 o'clock, facing east, and up the heavily wooded area above me, about 200-300 meters.  I instantly knew where I had heard such an unfamiliar call....about 3 years ago when watching a Bigfoot reality show, where these squatch hunters were making this strange/unique call while searching for Bigfoot. There was a few second delay from the first call, then a few more, then silence for about a minute, leaving me to wonder if this whole experience was real, pondering what I know about the wilderness, either that was an unknown animal or some kind of implausible prank.  It was loud, echoing down the mountain, as though some huge creature could belt like the lungs of Pavarotti, only much louder!  The chance of it being a prankster waiting in silence with me for 45 minutes in that remote location, just to hang out in these impenetrable woods and prank me, went away very quickly when, when another call out at about 3-400 meters to the north of the first, approx my 8 o'clock.  It was also just as loud, just as unique as the first, but came only 3 calls in succession, u-ah-o, u-ah-o, u-ah-o, with a distinct higher pitch on the ""ah"".  This absolutely blew my mind, because the first call might be an elk on steroids, but the response from what was clearly not an owl, brought chills down my spine.  This was some kind of communication between two individuals, neither which can be explained by any rationale. I must tell you that I have trekked and lived in remote areas in Africa, Australia, central and south America, many places of potential danger, and never had an inkling of fear.  I was born and raised near Yellowstone Park, with 100 times the average distance trekked by most individuals in their lifetime, and never had bad experiences with grizzly, mountain lions and wolves.  Travelling all these years with a firm understanding of ecosystems, I never could have believed in such mysteries, that anything new would ever be discovered. I had a fourth experience, which I must say something about, but it happened just the night before the dual vocalizations. On Friday evening, Nov 1st, 2019, I had just moved into a cabin that my brother and I rented, located along an extremely rugged canyon area of the Matole River.  It was dusk, quite dark already in the forest.  I was outside looking at the stars, taking in the newness of these rugged surroundings.  Up above, again about 300 meters up and to the east of the river, there was a screaming that was so loud and so foreboding that I could only listen in amazement.  It was the loudest screaming I've ever heard, so loud I thought it was produced by some kind of banshees from a horror film. The screams continued, full throttle, for over 5 minutes.  I know mountain lions can scream, but nothing like this. It sounded much louder, more guttural, literally as if someone had set up a loud speaker and played the bloodiest scream that Hollywood could produce.  At the time, the night after Halloween, I wondered if someone was up on the mountainside pranking me as a newcomer to the neighborhood. I listened for a bit, then went inside and told my brother about it because it was so unnerving.  Bigfoot did not even enter my mind.  But then at dusk the next evening I witnessed these 2 calls waiting at the gate. I have since been over and over in my mind, why have I been so lucky as to hear or experience such mystery?  Much less 3 distinct vocalizations which cannot be explained.  I began pouring over USGS maps and satellite imagery to ascertain what the link may be, 20 miles apart, are there any people or neighbors or access for individuals in the areas I experienced which may explain these?  Could one individual in such obvious stress on one night, have triggered the coincidental travel of at least 2 more unknown creatures the very next night?? I have talked to many locals about hearing strange noises, but no one claims anything, or they don't want to be ridiculed. Look, I am a man, 60 yo, with extensive wilderness experience in forests and jungles all over the world.  The closest thing to new species discovery for me was the Costa Rican jungles, but my mind has always been as a skeptic observer, dealing in evidence based biology as a science.  What has happened to me recently has completely changed me!  There is a mystery in these woods, and I have a few ideas how to answer them. Please feel free to contact me, if you would like access to these remote locations.  And I am very curious if other people in my area are having similar experiences.  Something unexplained to science lives out here, and I am beside myself with these recent events. Troy Hunter,  troy.hntr@gmail.com.  There is very limited cell service.  928-231-3***."
65849,Report 65849: Possible sighting at Mono Lake at Sunrise,Class B,2020-07-28T12:00:00Z,37.97761,-119.1291,2020,California,65849.0,"I went to Mono Lake with my father early in the morning to capture some long exposure photos of the sunrise. We arrived at the lake around 6 AM right at golden hour. When we got to the parking lol there was one other car parked in the lot. After grabbing my photography gear (camera bag/tripod) we began walking down the path towards the lake. I was looking off to my right hand side and clearly saw something that was all black and bipedal walking parallel with me about 15 yards away. It ducked behind a small tufa as I was watching it walk. I told my dad that I saw something walking on 2 feet and he said that he saw something moving over in that direction as well. I knew that there was a person in the same area as us since there was a car parked in the lot when we arrived so there was still a possibility that what I saw was a person dressed in all black, although it would be strange for a person to be walking off the path in the area where I saw this thing since we were still away from the lake where all of the points of interest are. My dad and I continued to walk towards the lake to shoot the sunrise. As we approached the lake there was another photographer who had their camera mounted on their tripod and was taking photos. At this point I realized that what I saw walking was not a person since the owner of the car who was parked when we arrived had just been accounted for. I did not think I would ever experience something like this in my lifetime. I wish I would have gone to the area where I saw it and looked for some evidence or footprints but I was too scared to stray off the path since it was able to disappear in the brush / tufas so easily."
65943,Report 65943: Possible tracks found close to Giant Forest Museum in Sequoia National Park,Class B,2020-08-15T12:00:00Z,36.56304,-118.7729,2020,California,65943.0,"Hello. My family and I took a trip to the Sequoia National Forest and were walking a trail near the Bear Hill Trail. I was taking pictures and videos of my children when I noticed a couple of footprints up the side of the hill.  The toes and heel indentations were very noticeable, very large and very deep into the dirt. The stride between the prints were approximately 6 feet apart. I also took photos and videos of the prints and with my foot next to them. What was very intimidating was that I am 6'6"" and weigh 380 lbs., so I'm no small guy at all. I wear shoe size 13 extra wide. These prints made my foot look childish. I tried my hardest to dig my foot into the dirt as deep as the prints were, but to no avail. Whatever made these prints had to be a considerably large animal. I then went back to the entrance of the Bear Hill Trail and walked up that trail and matched the area where I found the original prints, but higher up. It was there I found a third print and took a couple of pictures of that print as well, with one being my foot next to it to get the size. I have always been an avid believer in the Sasquatch animal, but I never thought that I would ever find anything like this."
67556,Report 67556: Possible night sighting by motorist on Hwy 101 six miles south of Garberville,Class B,2021-01-23T12:00:00Z,40.03527,-123.7876,2021,California,67556.0,"I was driving home from Brookings Oregon on 1-23-21. I was south bound on highway 101 south of Garberville, Ca and south of the Benbow Inn.  The road makes a few turns and the speed limit drops in the area. As I rounded a sweeping right hand turn I saw a figure on the south bound shoulder of the highway. I was the only vehicle in the area about 8:15 PM.   My speed was about 45-50 MPH as I passed the figure. The figure was laying on the shoulder of the road on its right side. I estimated the height to be about 7’. I was looking at the creatures back and noticed it had broad shoulders and was thick torso shape. While the shape similar to a human it was not human. It was not a bear either. I could see muscular features in its glutes and a head on the shoulders that was somewhat tapered toward the top and being held off the ground. It’s hair was a chocolate brown and very course. The hair was not fur like of a  bear at all. I turned around a distance past the spot and returned to where I had seen it.  No other vehicles had gone north or south from the time I saw the creature to the time I returned to its location (2 minutes estimate). When I got to the spot where I had seen it, the creature it was gone. As an avid hunter and fisherman I spend a lot of time in the woods. I spent every summer camping in that area as well as a kid. I have never seen anything like what I saw just this evening."
69315,"Report 69315: Possible ""Ohio howls"" heard on Hoopa Indian Reservation",Class B,2021-06-06T12:00:00Z,41.0312,-123.669,2021,California,69315.0,"This is to document my experience on Sunday, June 6, 2021. Something woke me up from dreaming.  I was dreaming I was trying to sleep but there was noise outside so in my dream I got out of bed and went to my window and pulled back the curtain.  I started tapping on the window to let whoever was outside know they were being noisy and disrupting my effort to try to sleep.   After my third tap on the window, I woke up from my dream and realized I had to go to the bathroom.  I got up and made my way to the toilet.  My bedroom window was open and my bathroom window was open.  Just before I flushed, I heard a faint noise, and I started to think it was a motorcycle coming around the bend on the highway, and in that second I thought to myself “Who would be riding a motorcycle this early in the morning?”. Then, the noise got louder and drawn out, and had a deep vibrating howl, and then it stopped.  I realized then that it was something I have never heard before and it was not human.  It sounded like it was on one of the mountains behind my house. Afterwards, I noticed there were no dogs barking, not even my dogs, and there weren’t even any crickets.  It was dead silence outside.  I was telling myself, oh my god, did I just hear what I think I heard?  I headed back to bed and noticed the clock said 3:33am. I asked my husband if he was awake. He had been snoring when I was in the bathroom.  I told him I had just heard something.  I explained the sound to him and I said I think it was a Bigfoot.  I could not believe what I had heard.  I could not sleep for over an hour, and we laid in bed waiting for more howling but there was none. The next day when I told everyone in the house, nobody had heard it.  Later Sunday morning, I used my cell phone to google different animal sounds to try to find the same howl I heard.  I tried Mountain lion, Wolf, Fisher, Fox, and none of them are in the least bit similar.  Then, I googled Bigfoot howls.  Oh my god! The 1994 Ohio Moaning Howl is almost exactly what I heard.  I got chills when I listened to it.  I played the recording to my household, and my oldest adult son recognized the sound also.  He as well as a few of his friends have had a few experiences too, including a rock being thrown at him. He has the rock in his bedroom.  I phoned my other family members and told them what I experienced and my mom told me that there was a post on facebook about a week earlier from someone that lives a few blocks away from me.  She was returning home late at night near the local dump (between Hoopa and Willow Creek, California).  Apparently, she thought she saw something near the highway and so did the car behind her as the other car turned around and drove back.   This location is only a couple of mountains away from where my home is located.  I figure the Bigfoot traveled to Hoopa from the dump site. I have lived in this area (Weitchpec and Hoopa, CA) almost my entire life and I have never, ever heard such a howl.  I think about the experience daily, but I actually feel fortunate to have witnessed this rare creature howling. Debbie Bailey"
72111,Report 72111: Possible sasquatch vocals heard by hikers in Humboldt Redwoods State Park,Class B,2022-01-16T12:00:00Z,40.44307,-123.9863,2022,California,72111.0,"We’ve been hiking a local trail in Redcrest, CA for the last 19 years called the Drury-Cheney trail. This is a trail that we hike regularly; I’m talking like 3-4x a week. It’s always a family affair me (30 years old), my son (2), my mom and dad (50’s). In the summer we hike the trail nearly everyday. We’ve never, ever gotten the creeps in those woods. The last two hikes have really changed that. After today’s hike has me thinking that we may not ever go back, I’m not sure. We were hiking along, gabbing and visiting. It takes us quiet awhile to finish up an otherwise quick trail because my son (who’s two) really sets the pace. We were nearly done, on our way out when a loud....and I’m talking loud....yell/scream/guteral screetch echoed through the woods. My family and I have grown up in the Redwoods, we’ve heard everything that nature has to offer in the way of animal sounds. It wasn’t a raven, a fox, a bear, a lion, a deer bleet, a chipmunk, or a hawk. It was sounded like a human, but the fact that it traveled through the woods so clearly and loud really shook all of us. Today’s sound was nothing we’ve ever heard before. It was LOUD and defined. It was just far enough in the distance for whatever it was to get its point across without making us petrified. It stopped my mother, me and my son in our tracks. There was no doubt that we all heard the same thing. My dad was talking and didn’t hear it this time, but my dads hard of hearing and doesn’t hear the best at certain tones. When we told him what we heard, he said he knew exactly what we were talking about because it happened last time he hiked the trail with my mom. We all got the feeling that we were being watched and that feeling didn’t go away until we started driving off. When we got back home my dad shared that he’s  heard that sound before and heard it the last hike before . For that particular hike, he took with my mom only. My dad said he hadn’t said anything before because he didn’t know what it could be and didn’t want to scare us. He said that through the the last few hikes he could feel that we were being watched, hearing things move in the brush and feeling like something was wrong the last few hikes. I don’t know it could be exactly. We’re no stranger to Bigfoot stories here in the PNW, but this time was a strange one for sure."
74829,Report 74829: RECENT: Campers hear bigfoot-like howls 11 miles west of Susanville,Class B,2022-08-12T12:00:00Z,40.37411,-120.8336,2022,California,74829.0,"My husband, our mastiff mix dog, and myself live in a small town called Susanville, California. It is located in Lassen County. We have lived in these parts for almost our whole lives, so we are quite familiar with our surroundings and  wildlife. This incident is fresh as it’s been less than a week since it happened. We had decided to go camping at an campground I found by accident on Google maps. Just a run down one camp spot located about half mile off highway 36 in Lassen county. The camp area is called Old Ferdonyer Campsite. Has a small creek that runs along it. We normally camp at a location called Roxey Peacon Campground which is a mile or so before this campground ground off the same highway. We have been camping there for 10-15 years with no incidents or complications. My husband and I have lived in these parts for 30+ years and have felt more than comfortable going camping alone or with family, without a second thought. We had explored this new place we found a couple times during the day after finding it and then decided we’d camp their one evening. We arrived at the sight between 6:15-6:30pm and set up camp. My husband started a small fire and began cooking steaks we brought with us. Our dog acted normally and was being lazy laying in the dirt. It was completely dark by the time we finished cooking. We kept the fire going just to keep small critters at bay. We could here them around us going to the creek and walking around. Our dog is pretty lazy and decided to get in the car to sleep. My husband was standing next to my chair finishing his food when I heard what sounded to me like a teenage boy hoots and hollers coming from below us like on the highway. My husband didn’t hear it a first until I said something about it as it was still going. We listened in complete silence. My husband turned to me and said that wasn’t human. Then the scariest growl, howl I don’t even know how to explain went off about 100 yards from behind us. My husband almost dropped his plate. It lasted only 5-10 seconds before whatever was at the bottom of the hill answered. Behind my husband up another hill where power poles run , another faint howl/ scream went off. We were in shock and could only stare at each other until it went silent. We both knew that was nothing we had ever heard in these woods and it was time to go. We’ve heard coyotes, wolves, fox, bear. This terrifying sound was none of the above. It was communicating with more of them. Coyote will do roll call on then howl/yapping. This sounded nothing like that! My dog refused to get out of the car at this point. We rushed in the dark to pick up everything an soon was making our way down the mountain to get home. We haven’t been back, and to be perfectly honest I haven’t been out in the woods since. Something I loved to do in a daily basis with my doggie. Too afraid and the sounds of that night still haunt me. We were at the camp site for exactly 3hrs 47 mins."
75096,Report 75096: Possible sighting and tree shaking on S. Fork American River 30 miles NE of Sacramento,Class B,2022-10-26T12:00:00Z,38.80643,-120.9699,2022,California,75096.0,"I was very hesitant to make a report, but was encouraged by a friend.  So here it is. I am an avid equestrian. I am now in my 60’s and ride strictly for relaxation. I trail ride 4-5 days a week.  The area I ride is a large rec area called Cronan Ranch.  It is strictly for bikes, horses and hiking with miles and miles of trails.  No motorized vehicles allowed.  The American River borders the rec area. When I ride I almost always go by the river to give my horses a drink.  For hikers/day walkers this particular river access point is the closest to the Pedro Hill trail head parking lot.  But still a long walk to the river with the return being all uphill. In the summer you will almost always find people at this access point enjoying the river.  There has been since I have been riding here over the last 3+ years  a picnic area with several large heavy duty wooden picnic tables. It is a awesome spot with shade and pit toilets nearby the tables.  But it is a tough trek for the average person who might not be fit or small children.  I often ride alone with my dog and lately I bring my other horse along to get exercise.  I pony/lead him while riding my horse.  Because I am older and ride alone so much I try to be very aware of my surroundings for both predatory animals such as bear and lion but also human predators. The latter is not a strong issue here but still wise to be aware. On this particular day I went out later in the morning than I normally do, getting to the trail around noon. There were a few hikers coming back to their cars but very few people and cars around this time of day. I rode about a 6 mile ride and did not see another person the entire ride which is somewhat unusual. I rode to the river to my favorite point for my horses to get a drink where the bank is less rocky.  After the horses watered I decided to go over to the picnic area and take some photos.  I had bought some new camera equipment that I wanted to experiment with and I thought I would use the tables to set up my tripod.  To my surprise the tables had all been removed!  I honestly don’t know if this is significant to the story or not, but it struck me as very strange because it would have been quite a monumental task to remove these very heavy tables. So I stood there just letting the horses rest while a took just a couple of pictures with my phone.  The first pic I will post will be a picture I took looking towards the river.  You will notice the two large trees with the gap looking towards the river.  The river is hard to see as there is a small hill/mound between me and the river.  This photo is strictly for reference. After taking the photo I put my phone away and prepared to head back. I had abandoned the idea of trying the new equipment. As I still stood there facing the river, some movement caught my eye and I turned my eyes toward the movement. What I saw was “something” that was obviously darting into some cover to avoid being seen.  I caught only a quick glimpse but the part of the body was the buttocks and leg as it ran and ducked.  It appeared to be reddish brown in color.  As we all know our minds are very capable of quickly assessing what our eyes see - or at least attempting to.  My first impression was oh it is someone down at the river possibly skinny dipping who didn’t know I was there.  The reason I thought it was a person was the movement.  It appeared to be upright and moved and acted like a person wanting not to be seen.  However, I quickly reminded myself it was dark reddish brown, so not likely naked especially with the water in the 40 degree range. Let me say this..I cannot say the reddish brown was hair.  I do not see details like that at that distance to say definitively.  So my next thought was oh it must have been a bear.  Now from the time I saw this and all these thoughts went thru my head was only seconds. Maybe split seconds before what happened next.  Had I only caught this glimpse of whatever it was and that was it? I would have rode on and never thought about it again.  But within a second of jumping into this cover which consisted of some low tree branches and brush,  I saw a small group of trees that suddenly began violently shaking.  The branches or trunks were being pushed back and forth crossing over each other by a good four feet and again, violently being shook. I stood there watching in shock and wondering what the hell was that!  I decided to ride up the trail that paralleled this spot and get to a higher point to see if I could figure out what it was.  I kept my eyes peeled for any movement.  The area had bushes and large rocks, but I knew if this was a bear it was open enough that I would eventually catch sight of him.  It is unusual behavior for a bear to climb a tree for safety, and most bears do not wish to share space with humans.  They normally just run or walk away.  They do not normally crouch down and hide.  So my thought was still that this could still be a bear.  After all Bigfoot is not and should not be anyone’s first thought and it wasn’t mine.  However, when I could not see any sign of anything I was totally mystified and thought that I might backtrack and get closer to the spot and see if anyone or anything was hiding.  Because whatever it was I felt was hiding.  But since I was alone and unarmed I decided to just leave. The more I contemplated what I saw the more mystified I was.  I came home and told my husband the story and he was also shocked and mystified.  So I decided that I would go back the next day and see if I could see any evidence that might explain what I saw. The area as I mentioned before was very rocky and even my horse at over 1000 pounds did not leave much of a track if any.  So I wasn’t really expecting to see a track.  But to my surprise there was a somewhat sandy area near the sighting and I noticed a footprint that had distinct toes.  My first thought was that it was likely a human footprint because this was a popular area and despite the cooler weather and very cold water someone might take off their shoes.  But decided to get down and look closer.  To my shock the footprint was much longer than my boot! While not very wide it was dramatically bigger than mine.  I wear a size 9 (woman’s) and I was also wearing boots which are bigger yet.  I took a photo but unfortunately photos often don’t do justice to the definition that I could see with the naked eye. After finding the footprint I proceeded to the area where the tree(s) was where it darted into.  What shocked me the most was the tree.  What I thought was a group of trees was actually one tree. The diameter of the base was at least a foot or more.  The tree had obviously at some point due to what appears high water levels during a record storm been under water.  The waters had sheared off the top at about the 12 foot level.  After the water receded the tree recovered and grew new branches. It was these branches that were being violently shaken back and forth.  This was not just shaking the tree. The branches were grasped as though with two hands and flailed back and forth.  When it let go of them they snapped back into place. This animal had to reach the 8-10 foot range at least and brutally strong.  While bears are VERY strong and do push on trees, their paws are not very suited to grasp two branches at once and push and pull them apart.  Also why would a bear going from running away to immediately stop and shake the tree.  I’m not saying that is not possible but doesn’t seem probable.  I did not see any other evidence and due to the fact that I did not see the head of this thing I stay openly skeptical as I think everyone always should.  But that is my story and you can take it for what you wish."
75290,"Report 75290: Bigfoot-like Howls and Stalking at North Battle Creek Reservoir, Lassen National Forest",Class B,2022-07-19T12:00:00Z,40.59781,-121.6476,2022,California,75290.0,"This happened mid July 2022.  My name is John. I am a 66 year old man. My wife and I are finally retired and planned on going camping for a week at a time. We have been wanting to go up to north Battle Creek and fish for a lot of years. We have fished it in the past but we wanted to stay for more than a day at a time.  I have been a hunter my hole life. I hunted deer, bear, pig and have have filled my tags every year. So I know how animals react to different situations. And I can identify all species. Due to health reasons we had to wait until early July to make our first trip. We made reservations to get the camping spot we wanted which was closest to the lake. It was hell waiting for the day to come. The day we left was mid July. It was only a two hour trip from our home in Northern California to north Battle Creek. We left about ten in the morning. The road going in there was a dirt road about nine miles back in the woods. We didn’t see any wildlife on the trip in. Which I thought was strange. But when we drop into the valley where the lake was I told my wife and oldest son Shane that we were dropping in to Sasquatch valley. This was on a Sunday and people were leaving. So there was only a few people still camping. We found our camp site and set up. It was so beautiful there. It was in the 100s at home when we left and only 85 at the lake. Wow, what a relief. The day was so nice we stayed in camp that day and put our kayaks at the boat ramp .  We have a very good dinner that night and turned in right after dark. On Monday their was only one other group camping besides us. They were about 80 yards away. I got up around 4:30am and sat around the camp until it was light enough to see. I got my gear and walked down to the lake put my things in my kayak and took off. The fishing was great. I got my limit. I was the only person on the lake. About 10:30 I headed back to camp with my catch. Everyone was up and I told my son to go clean my fish (family joke). We sat around the rest of the day talking and enjoying the beautiful day. We saw some cows at the east side of the camp ground. But didn’t think anything of it. The day was very uneventful. We had dinner which wife is a great cook and went to bed. It was nice and cool at night in the 50s. Tuesday morning comes I am up again at 4:30am. I was sitting at the table when I heard a very load yell or howl. I could not come up with what it could have been. Everyone else was still asleep so when It was light enough I walked down and took off fishing in my kayak. As I was fishing I started hearing more yells or howls coming from the west side of the lake. Then I heard it from the north side of the lake. Then I heard a lot coming from the east side of the lake. I must have heard ten different yells or howls that morning fishing. I went back to camp after it all stopped with my limit of trout. When I got back to camp my wife was up and I asked her if she heard the yells or howls and she said she did and said it was the black angus cows. But it didn’t sound like any cow I have ever heard. This was different. So I sat down and told my son, when he got up, hey, clean those fish. Well first he is not a boy he is 49 and 6’1” 245 pounds of muscle no fat at all. He heard the sound also and didn’t think it was a cow.  He is the oldest of nine boys. He had his dog with him her name is Penelope. She is a little dog about ten pounds. Late at night the people at the other camp started to make a lot of noise yelling and fighting. They threw everything in their trucks and left very very early. My son said he couldn’t tell what was going on over there. But when I got up they were gone. We talked about it all day because it didn’t sound right. The rest of that day was normal. Nothing else happened until it got dark and we went to bed. Then it became a epic night of biblical proportions. A night that will live in infamy in my sons mind. We all went to bed that night and he got in his sleeping bag and was reading a book. Me and my wife fell to sleep quick. But not long after we fell asleep his dog started to shake and she was growling low. That’s when Shane heard something very big walk up to his tent fast and stop then walk half way around it. He yelled get out of here. What ever it was walked a way fast and very heavy.  He said it sounded like a very big man with over size boots on and very heavy and on two legs. He said when it walked up he had his reading light on and when it stopped at his tent he very slowly turned his light off. Before he yelled. A few minutes later he heard his dog growling again and start to shake again. He heard the heavy footsteps and again it stopped at his tent then walked around it. He pumped himself up to confront who ever it was. When he was pumped up enough he jumped up and run out of his tent with his book light and his book in his hand to confront who ever it was. He turned his light on and shined his light about all of three feet but there was no one there but he could hear it walking away again. He yelled for me but I didn’t hear him. Now he was getting very worried it could see him but he couldn’t see it. So he got back in his tent and zipped up the door this time. A few minutes later it started to come back again his dog was shaking again and growling. It came again to his tent and stopped. He sat there listening. It walked around his tent then walked off again. The rest of the night he tried to listen to see if it would come back but finally fall asleep. I woke up at 4:30 and went fishing again nothing looked any different. I didn’t know what had happened that night yet. So I went fishing and got my limit and came back to camp about 8:30. My wife was up so I had coffee with her. When my son got up a few minutes later he had a very weird look on his face. He started to walk around his like he was looking for something. I helped him look for tracks but only found some deer tracks about 30 feet away. So I told him he has more fish to clean. Then he started to tell us about what had happened last night. I told him I didn’t hear anything. We talked about it all day and I told him it couldn’t be a deer they walk slow and quiet. It wouldn’t be a bear they walk slow and would have went to the kitchen for food and if you scared them they most likely not come back that quick. I told him you must have had been a Bigfoot visit you. Dam and I missed it. He didn’t believe in Bigfoot before that night but now he is starting to. I have never seen him so scared as he was when he came out of that tent in the morning he must have been shitting twinkies all night. After that night we didn’t see any more cows until Friday night when people started to come back in camping. But the next night on Wednesday night I figured on scaring him a little so I put fishing line on the back of has tent then ran it to my trailer door hooked to a stick. That night I got up at 12:30 and started to pull the line but he was asleep all ready so I went back to bed. A few minutes later something walked between my trailer and his tent and I heard the stick hit the door . Then it must have stopped and backed up a bit because the stick hit the floor and made a noise.then it started to walk again and the stick hit the door again.and broke.The next morning I went to pick up the line and it was way over behind my trailer not even close to where I had  I figure it was after the fish heads my son had put in the fire pit. The rest of our trip was as normal as could be. But when I got home I started to look up Bigfoot sounds YouTube and I found that exact one. It was 16 sounds of Bigfoot in the Serras, the 7th sound. So I went up to our corner store and was telling the lady that works there her name is Lisa what had happened. And she said the same thing had happened to her 5 years before in the same place. My neighbor had something happen to him up there too. So I hope you can make sense of all this . You can use our names I am not afraid of what people think. Thank you, John and Shane"

44401,Report 44401: YMCA camp guest has a possible nighttime sighting and hears strange vocalizations in Estes Park,Class B,2014-02-09T12:00:00Z,40.33838,-105.5728,2014,Colorado,44401.0,"Visual Incident: I was spending the evening at a 2 bedroom cabin at the YMCA in Estes Park. It had been a cold, snowy day, and I had gone to bed rather early (around 8 pm.). I awakened at 2:30 and got up to look out the bedroom window, through the curtains, just to check on the weather, see if stars were out, etc. I noticed that the basement lights were still on in the rather large, two-story 3-bedroom family cabin. This cabin was about 75 yards directly SE of my cabin (in back of me). I assumed the lights were still on since children may have been playing games that night, and simply forgot to turn out the lights. I looked out the window of about a half minute with this thought on my mind. I didn't see any movement inside the cabin basement, so I assumed the family had retired for the evening. Just as I was about to close the curtain, I saw a very tall, rather large, dark figure stride past the entirely of the basement, across the snow. The stride of this figure was very deliberate and determined. It did not waiver. It did not rush. The figure had long legs, and was mostly all legs. Its torso was solid and straight. It did not look human, I did not discern any clothing on it. I was puzzled at first, thinking, ""Who in their right mind would be outside in this weather, walking in the deep snow (about 1/2 foot or so deep) outside past the lighted basement of this cabin? The figure emerged from the right side of the cabin and was heading to the left side, which would have been toward the direction of the road and the next set of cabins (about 50 or more yards away). There were no other lights on at the time, but the snow held its own illumination in the dark. The basement back-lighting created the perfect silhouette for the striding figure. I only saw it swing its arms, it was not carrying anything. After I watched it pass, I closed the curtain (this episode lasted about 20-30 seconds) and then it occurred to me it had resembled images of what I have been informed about regarding sightings of Bigfoot. i did not have Bigfoot on my mind AT ALL prior to this incident. The image remained in my mind for a good while, so I got up and checked all the locks on the doors, just to feel more safe, since I was staying alone in the cabin. Auditory (Vocalization episode) The next day was especially snowy, almost like a white out. The snow was VERY thick and it was easy to get stuck, as the YMCA plows were working as hard and fast as they could to clear the narrow roads throughout the campus. It was very difficult to pass safely down some of the roads. I had just come out of the Mootz Crafts Center, and had gotten my car stuck. I was fortunate that some kind male guests spotted me getting stuck and helped to push my car out of a snow bank. They left quickly and went back inside the lodge nearby. The snow was falling quickly and heavily, and I was beginning to worry I might get stuck again. I was standing outside my car, trying to determine the best driving route to take, when all of a sudden from the back of the woods, nearby what I would determine was the Livery Stables, came a very loudly projected guttural (like from the deep part of the back of a throat) type of cry-moan. It lasted several seconds (about 4 seconds or so). I looked around to see if I could see anyone, but no one was out at all. The weather was far too severe. I stood by my car, opened the car-door, which made a squeak, and the sound uttered once again, almost exactly as it had the first time. Same loudly projected quality, carrying from somewhere back deep in the nearby woods. This time, I felt intimated and frightened. This sound did not match the sound of an elk, or a mountain lion or a person, or a kid being silly. ""The bears are all asleep,"" I thought. The message that I perceived from it was ""I am here. I can see you. This is my territory."" I quickly got into my car, closed the door and managed to pull away out of the deep snow, leaving the YMCA campus. it was a very eerie experience,and I can still feel the chill going up my spine as I think of the impact of those howls on that very snowy day."

Initially I heard what sounded like something clearing its throat but it was a very deep sound that was like nothing I've ever heard. 20 minutes later I heard what sounded like a rock land close to my tent and a few seconds later I heard another one land with a thud, neither sounded as if they rolled as the ground was damp from snow melt. Just after 11 pm I heard something come from the tree line behind me ""wooooo"" ""wooooo"" from two separate locations as if there were several and they were talking to each other.

It is Thursday 08/23/18 and we are just getting to our vehicle from a harrowing hike. We were hiking the road at Kenosha Pass on the east side that takes you to the twin cones above tree line. We began our hike at noon and hiked up the road. We reached the twin cone tree line area at 3:30pm. It was a beautiful and uneventful hike until we were headed back down the road. My daughter had said she thought that she had heard a tree knock and I was being silly and took a rock and knocked on a large rock off of the road and then tossed the rock about 5 ft off of the road. Literally 2 minutes later we both heard multiple loud tree knocking and rocks were whizzing past our heads. The stench was unbearable-like nothing I have ever smelled before. My 21yr.old daughter began to scream and cry as we were under attack by someone or something. I was so startled that I just stood there frozen as this dark figure was staring back at me. I couldn’t move. My daughter grabbed my arm and we took off. I had an air horn that I depressed 3 times as we were running away and that seemed to deter the rock throwing. The rock throwing continued for 5 more minutes as we ran down the hill. We were almost to our vehicle which was parked off the dirt road when we heard a loud guttural whoop off the road abit and we just kept running to the car so very very afraid! We made it back to our vehicle at 6:15pm. I will never return and we are not okay with this. This needs to be investigated please.

He has a bad back and doesn't walk far. We had walkie talkies. I went on ahead where the sound was coming from. I was talking to my husband on the walkie talkie. When I went up the hill in the wooded area  I could hear limbs cracking like someone walking nearby. I saw a rock outcropping area. I felt like I got zapped by infra-sound. I took a picture in that direction of the noise and child like sounds. My phone went dead but my w.t. I had my was still working. I was disoriented and did not know which way to go so husband clacked rocks together making noise so I would know where to go. I was in a daze. I found my husband, went back to cabin and charged my phone to look at the pictures I took, and there he was standing behind a tree, looking at me. It sounded like there was more than one.

They were 8 and 10 years old at the time. We go there quite a bit because it's far enough away to avoid the Denver crowds that flood local trails and parks but close enough it's not a days drive to get there. I have a spot near Tarryall Reservoir I have camped at several times before. It's a few miles off the main dirt road up a jeep trail and during the week there are usually not many people there. I like it because it's on a ridgeline overlooking a small valley. It’s at the end of the Jeep trail, so on the way up and once I’m there I can easily tell if anyone is in the area or coming up on our camp. We got there on a Thursday morning and I didn’t see anyone on the way nor hear anyone down in the valley below us. I had heard bigfoot stories like everyone else but never thought about it or gave them much credit. I figured it was like alien abductions or something. Weird stories that happened in people's imaginations but not real. I do know it wasn’t on my mind when we arrived. We set up and hung out the entire day around camp. The plan was to stay 3-4 nights. We didn't have a fire because there was a fire ban at the time. That night the kids went to bed as soon as it got dark. I went to bed around 11:30 pm or so. I was lying in my sleeping bag for about 20 minutes messing with my phone to see if I could get coverage and play some games. I could hear coyotes start to howl and bark down in the valley below us, where I believe they had a few dens. In the middle of this coyote chatter and barking I hear, about half a quarter mile in the valley below,  this startlingly sound I have never heard before. I have spent years in the mountains. I have heard just about every animal sound there is. With the exception of coyotes, an occasional owl, ranchers cattle, and very rarely a screaming mountain lion most animals stay quiet at night. I heard two deep “WHOOOOP” WHOOOP” sounds coming from about a quarter mile in the small Valley below. The howling from the coyotes instantly stopped and remained silent. At first I thought maybe it was some drunk campers messing around. I had driven through the valley the day before and had seen no one there. Again I hear another series of loud whooping calls. I am running through my head what animal it could be. A bear? A mountain lion? Some sort of crane or bird? I hear it again. Did some ape escape the zoo or and get loose in the mountains? I start hearing what sounds likes someone beating two large pieces of firewood together. These sounds go on for another good 10-15 minutes. After it was over I stayed awake for several hours waiting for the noises to return. At the time I am thinking some idiots came in late to camp and were screwing around in the woods. The next day I walk down to the area I heard the noises come from, to check to see if anyone was there. Not a soul. I thought maybe whoever was there had packed up early and left. We spent the rest of the day at camp and hiking around. Later that afternoon, before dinner I shot some of the rifles I had brought. Amazingly my kids had slept through the previous nights noises and I didn’t tell them about it. I didn’t want to scare them for no reason. The kids went to bed around 9:30 and I stayed up. I figured I would stay up a bit later to see if the sounds would return. About midnight I decided to turn in and get some sleep. I lay awake in my sleeping bag for quite awhile. I still couldn't sleep. Eventually I started to nod off thinking nothing was going to happen that night and whoever had been messing around the night before was gone. I am guessing it was maybe 30 minutes into a very light sleep later that I was startled awake to the sound of two very deep, and loud “WHOOOOP” “WHOOOOP” sounds. This time the sounds were much louder because the sounds were coming from about 70 yards from our camp near the jeep road below us. I am both half scared and half very pissed. I quickly jump out of the tent. I'm now thinking the jerks from the night before have decided to make this personal and have been stalking our camp and think its funny to wake us up in the middle of the night. I never go out in the woods without a rifle and a good light. (I have run into idiots out in the woods before). I heard the whooping noise a couple more times while I started to walk down the slope of the ridge about 25 yards. I was thinking if these people were armed I didn’t want to engage in gun fight in the middle of my camp. I scanned the tree line with my rifle mounted light looking for movement. Each time changing positions after each scan. As I moved a bit further something off to my right and about 30-40 yards away went crashing through the woods. I know what somebody running through the woods sounds like. Whatever this was, it was very big and very heavy. I am thinking “what the heck, is Shaquille O'neal with them? It was running very fast and covering more ground than an average person could. It was also snapping branches and small trees like they were just grass. I could hear the heavy pounding of its large foot steps. At this point, my heart is pounding in my chest as I high tail it back to the camp. I don’t know if this person is running away or trying to flank me.  I was now debating in my head on what to do. Wake the kids (I have no idea to this day how they slept through this) and break camp and leave knowing they will be scared to death when I do. The down side to that is there will be no one to watch our backs as we pack up and I get them up, we’ll make a lot of noise loading the truck, and the trip out puts us down the jeep trail where I was hearing the noises to begin with. I elect my second option. I find a spot in the trees and shadows where I can observe camp and silhouette anyone approaching against the skyline without silhouetting myself. If anyone comes up the hill I will hit them with the light and confront and engage them if I have to. I figure anyone sneaking around my camp at night doing these things can’t have good intentions. I didn’t sleep the rest of the night. I sat waiting with my back against the tree the entire time. I never told the kids. I made up some excuse why we had to leave early that morning and never explained why I was so exhausted. Though the idea of bigfoot was in the back of my mind that second night, for whatever reason my logical side wanted to explain it off as some assholes playing games in the woods. Over the next week, after we got back home, I couldn't shake both the question of what those noises were and was there a possibility that it was a bigfoot. I didn’t really know what a bigfoot would sound like so I started searching google for “bigfoot sounds” That's when I came across this video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuDRpYLsP5c At point :22 of the video I found the exact noises I heard that night. I have listened to it over a dozen times since. I also did some more research on the area. To my surprise I discovered that not only does the area have many reports of bigfoot sightings and encounters but that it is listed as one of the top 10 places to encounter bigfoot in the United States. I also found out there had been a documentary filmed in the area a few years before and featured in the film was Observatory peak; which I could see from my camp a few miles away. There have been so many sightings in the area that the nearby town of Bailey has since placed bigfoot crossing signs along their small town roads. Now when I go up to that area my mindset is a bit different. I look over my shoulder a bit more and I search the tree lines for anything that might be watching me. We went backpacking on the other side of the mountain last year. It was hard to sleep because I was waiting to hear those whoops again. I don't know what it was for sure that night but I don't think it was human. I will be back up there this June. We will see what happens. "

My wife was spooked and we turned around to go back. As we neared the spot where the droppings were I spotted a  single foot print on the uphill side partly hidden by branches. I took pictures using my water bottle and shoe(size 10) for comparison. I wanted to spend more time but my wife and dog were very agitated. I spent 5 minutes searching for a rock or log or anything that would fit in the form of the print thinking it must have been a rock to have left such a deep, clear impression. No luck. We left in a hurry."
69394,Report 69394: Family hears loud wood knocks at Deer Lakes outside Lake City,Class B,2021-06-12T12:00:00Z,38.02372,-107.193,2021,Colorado,69394.0,"I want to share an experience my family and I had near Lake City, CO on June 12, 2021. We have visited Lake City for several years in a row, spending a week there each summer. One of our favorite places is Deer Lakes, about 15 miles southeast of Lake City off Hwy 149. We always spend several evenings out there fishing, cooking out, watching wildlife. Also found in that area are two ponds known as the Upper Mill Pond, nearest Hwy 149, and the Lower Mill Pond another mile or two down the road. On our way to Deer Lakes this visit, we stopped at the Upper Mill Pond to fish, but we saw a cow moose and two calves just below the pond eating in the runoff creek. (We almost always see moose near Deer Lakes) While we were watching the moose from the cab of our truck, we heard the undisputable sound of a wood knock. At first, none of us thought much about it, until we heard another one. I was in the driver seat, furthest away from the pond and moose. My daughter was in the backseat on the driver's side while my wife was in the front passenger seat nearest the pond and moose. The girls thought the sound came from the direction of the pond but I thought it came from the other direction. The pond, and road to Deer Lakes, sits in a valley between two ridges. The tree line on the east, or pond side, is only about a hundred yards away from the road while the tree line to the west, or opposite the pond, varies, in some places a few hundred yards from the road and other places not far off at all. My daughter and I got out of the cab of the truck to listen after we all heard the second knock. Then she and I both believed the sounds were coming from the west tree line. We waited, listening, and heard another knock, this time seemingly from a different position from the first two knocks. In a bit, another vehicle stopped to watch the moose. When they arrived, we heard another knock. A third vehicle drove past and we heard still another knock as it went by. In all,  we heard what I would guess to be 8-10 knocks, from at least three different positions, but all on the west side of the road. My family and I talked about it. It was possible that there were a few guys in the woods making the sounds. Maybe one guy knocked on a tree, then another heard it and knocked back. That's possible. However, what sealed it as a bigfoot for me happened later that night. After we heard the knocks by the Upper Mill Pond while watching the moose, we went on to Deer Lakes where we planned to fish, but our lines were too tangled. We did get to cook out though. As the sun went down, we left Deer Lakes but drove further away from the highway, waiting until it got very dark before we went back to town so we could se the stars really well. Just off Hwy 149 on the road to Deer Lakes is a staging area for people to park trailers to unload their ATVs. There is also a forest department bathroom there. That is where we parked to stargaze. As soon as we got out of the truck and shut the doors, we heard a knock from the east ridge of mountains. This tree line is several hundred yards from the road. It was not yet pitch dark. We could still make out the silhouette of the mountain against the backdrop of the sky, but it was too dark to make out any individual trees. I can't imagine any reason any person would be up on that ridge, at that time of night, in the dark, in the cold, just waiting for the possible chance that someone would stop at that staging area and get out of their vehicle so they could hoax them with a wood knock. I believed, for sure, at that time that bigfoot were in the area. In full disclosure, I am a bigfoot enthusiast. I watch all the tv shows, I watch videos on youtube, I have been a member of forums. But I live near Amarillo, TX where it is flat, dry farmland. There is no bigfoot hunting around here. I do always keep my eyes open when we visit the mountains or wooded areas, but this is my first experience of anything that I would contribute in any way to bigfoot. On a related note, a few years ago on an earlier trip to Lake City and Deer Lakes, my family and I were getting ready to leave Deer Lakes. I had to visit the men's room before we drove back to town, so my wife and daughter were walking up the path from the lakes to the parking lot. They heard what they described as an incredible crash, very loud and sudden. An adult male moose was in the upper lake eating when the crash occurred. This moose was frightened so much that he raced out of the water and into the woods, scaring my family terribly. When I came out of the restroom they were at the truck and asked me if I heard the crash. I had not heard anything somehow. They told me what happened and I instantly thought of bigfoot pushing over a tree in the woods up from the lake. There was no way for us to know for sure. The girls certainly didn't want to go into the woods to investigate. So we could possibly have had two bigfoot encounters at or near Deer Lakes. I am almost positive we heard them knocking on June 12, 2021. Thanks for your time. Sorry for rambling on so long about something probably insignificant to most people. But it was my first encounter and I was pretty excited about it. Let me know if you have any follow up questions. Tyler Allison"

I caught my first fish within minutes of arriving.  When I brought the fish to shore I heard 3 distinct knocks coming from behind and above me. There is a rather steep, high (30 ft?) slope along the access road near the boat ramp. I turned around thinking it was people walking down the road.  Nothing there...  I threw the fish back and recast.  I caught another within a few minutes.  As i brought this one to shore, I heard another 3 distinct knocks from the same spot and again turned around to see if someone was there.  No one! This boat launch/pond is about 4 - 5 miles in from the main road and the only houses around were on the other side of the pond, the opposite direction of the knocks.  I am pretty sure it was an encounter with Sasquatch even though I did not see or smell one.  The knocking was too ""human"" to be an animal and there were NO people around."

It was between 4 and 4:30 pm while I was driving that I noticed something running on someone's farm land. There were cows gathered in a pasture near the house. The creature was running in their direction but at a long even stride. I was probably about 150 yds away on the highway. It was brown/black in color and was the same all over. The stride was long, maybe about 3 1/2 to 4 ft. between steps. The creature looked at least 6' ft tall. It was the first thing I thought of as it was on two legs and all the other animals were on four. It looked out of place. No one else was around as far as I could see. The creature was running along the fence line. Which should be mentioned is that CR42 runs the southern edge of the Ocala National Forest where sightings have been seen. On Sept. 4th I had to pick up tickets in Deland for a trip. I took the same road but passed the farm because of traffic behind me. I wanted to photograph the area but couldn't."

I thought nothing of the SUV until this tall creature stepped onto the road and in two steps had crossed the lane I was driving in and was into the left lane and my view of it was then obstructed. It was completely covered in thick hair, all the way to the pavement. I couldn't see any feet and it was about 1/8 mile away so I didn't see any facial features. The head did not bob up and down as it walked. It just went straight across the road. I have never seen anything move so quickly. I've seen lots of animals cross the road in that general vicinity because there are not many houses or much development, and I have NEVER seen that. I did not believe in Bigfoot and teased my husband because he believed. I will never doubt another sighting report. The hair of the chest was slightly orange in the bright sunshine. It moved so fast I was unable to see it's face but I saw the right arm swing back and the left arm swing back and then it stepped out of view. I kept driving towards it and the SUV and I thought I might flag that SUV down and ask if they saw it but when it got close to me, but decided not to. The hair kind of stood up above the head. I would say it had a sort of flat forehead and kind of a pointy head. The hair seemed to be standing above it's head but there wasn't any wind. I would be happy to show some BFRO person exactly where this happened and explain it to them if someone wants to contact me or come here for a visit."

We were driving along a road that we have been many times. It's a nice little stretch of road with a great view. The land is beautiful with lots of natural Florida woods with swamp areas. There are also many orange groves in this area. It's not uncommon to see turkeys, hogs and occasional deer. The pasture land has cows on it from time to time. When this sighting happened there were no cows around. It was about 12:15 pm. The weather was over cast and it was going to rain at any minute. No other cars around. We passed one after the sighting down the road when we turned around to go back. We have had a ton of rain in this area lately. As we were traveling down the road we came up on this swampy area in a very large oak hammock. My 17 yr old son was the first to ask if me and my mother saw that? My 72 year old mother said yes but what was it? I said I saw it too...we keep driving for about 2 minutes we said nothing then my mother said turn around and go back. We all saw something and we need to go back and look. So I turned around and went back. But it was not there as far as we could see. We pulled up to the area and just sat there. All of us trying to figure out what we saw. We all saw a human like figure standing out in the middle of the marshy swampy area up to it's waist in water. The figured appeared to be a dull brown color. It was wide across the shoulders with hair and looked like moss hanging from it. It was standing up with it's long limbs away from it's body. The head was kinda down. The shape of the head was different. My oldest son described the head as different from a human. We are not sure what exactly it was doing. In the past we have seen cows out in this marshy swampy area. My Mother was trying to justify what she saw hating to admit that it was beyond strange. But she did admit at how very strange it was. I turned the truck around and we headed home. We talked about it a little more and then just let it die. We had a very stressful morning after coming from an appointment to see if my son had cancer. He did not and we were all so dazed seeing that was over kill. Very emotional day."

Then I saw that it was a creature standing  trying not to be seen and as still as can be. I couldn’t speak, I couldn’t process what I was seeing and then the words left my mouth... “Honey” I said to my husband, “I just saw a Sasquatch by the side of the road crouching down”.

I didn't even believe in bigfoot before this.  I saw a big white furry animal standing straight up like a human crossing over the stream. We were traveling fast on the road so we couldn't just stop.  I told my husband I just saw an animal as I was in shock about what I saw.  He didn't see it as he was driving.  It took me two days to realize I just saw a bigfoot.  I think I was in shock about what I had seen.

I called an individual and on the phone with them while I’m still watching it. At first before I started recording I noticed it and for a second I thought a hiker or hunter. But it’s posture and how it moved didn’t look right. To me it looked hunched over or like it’s shoulders we’re rolled forward. I showed a buddy and he agrees with me so idk. Found a dismantled deer very close by. Head was missing and front legs were ripped off. Their was a document sighting on BFRO about 1 mile or so from here.

We were in some super thick pine wood area that had a ton of hog sign which was right by the river and swamp area. We had just found a big sign of uprooted area from hog and we decided to sit for a second and see if we could hear anything. After a few minutes we heard a pretty big limb snap and I saw what I thought was a buzzard fly off, so not sure if it was the buzzard that snapped the limb or the result of the tree snapping which spooked the buzzard into flying off. A few minutes after that I heard what sounded like a person slamming a baseball bat in a tree 3 times (knock knock knock) very loud from around 100-150ft away and about 5 seconds after that another (knock knock knock) which sounded around 300-400 yards away. Our initial thought is that it was other hunters possibly taking down a tree stand since it’s the end of the season. With us thinking it was other humans we walked through the dense woods to the road and expected to see a truck parked along the side of the road on our way back to my truck. We did not see a single othe vehicle the walk back (and even drove  the opposite way and no cars). And there’s no way given the location in the terrain that you could get to this spot other than by car. I know what woodpeckers sound like and unless the woodpecker was the size of a Pterodactyl it was not that. The first set of knocking was so loud there was no way it was anything I am familiar with. Given the fact there was no other cars in the area I honestly do not know what else could have made those noises."

We wanted to explore some Florida forest land. We happened upon the “Rock Springs Run State Reserve”. We drove onto a dirt road, and parked off to the side. We got out and just started walking around. Right away, we saw a lot of vultures and groups of white tail deer. The area was buzzing with wildlife and sounds we didn’t recognize. We wanted to walk deeper into the trees, which would take us down to a lower terrain, but even with our hiking clothes and shoes, it turned out to be too much for us. We’re very healthy and active, but it didn’t seem like a fun idea. There were just too many wet, swampy areas of ground, and it turned out to be almost impossible, and we weren’t sure if we wanted to be struggling through alligator territory. We made our way back up to a dirt path, and that’s when we started hearing the banging sound. At first we thought it was a person out there doing something. But then the same sound started coming from another direction, maybe a quarter mile from the first one. It sounded like a they were hitting trees with a baseball bat, or a big piece of wood. It continued to go back and forth from one spot to another. It was one of those things that didn’t seem weird at first, until you stop to think about it. No animals do that, and why would people go way out there and begin hitting trees in the swamp, and then take turns doing it? We just couldn’t fathom what the purpose would be. We listened then walked back to the car and left."
74678,Report 74678: Possible 1AM sighting by commuter on forest road 17 miles west of Daytona Beach,Class B,2021-07-20T12:00:00Z,29.16675,-81.29897,2021,Florida,74678.0,"July 20th 2021. I was coming home from work and was travelling south down highway 11 in DeLeon Springs FL. It was about 1am and was hot and humid night. Normally I don't take this road home, but I was curious if I could see any deer along Blackwelder road late at night, as I was interested in hunting at a property on that road. I was in my pickup truck and it does have a bright light bar on it, so as I approached the wooded section of the road, I turned on the lightbar so I could see more of the side of the road, so I could tell if there were deer along the side of the road. I was travelling at about 60 MPH. Right as I flipped on the lightbar, and it shone down the road, I noticed a large creature moving across the road on two legs. I was a good distance from it still. I gradually slowed down from surprise at seeing it. It cleared the road in about two steps and disappeared behind a group of trees close to the road. Once I reached the point where I thought it crossed, I was going probably 30 miles per hour. It didn't seem to notice the guard rail at all, just went over it in stride it seemed. I could tell right where it crossed because there where big wet footprints on the road. I went up to the boat ramp parking lot and turned around to see if I could go back and see it again. As spooked as I was, I wanted to see it again to confirm what I saw. I slowly went back, keeping my lightbar on. As I passed the area, I could see the place where I believe it went into the woods. There was an area where it looked disturbed at the tree line, like something had just walked into the woods there. There was no sign of the creature. As I approached the footprints, I compared them to the stripes in the road. One footprint was on the dividing line down the middle. It appeared to be about 8 inches wide and maybe twice as long as it was wide. This observation was done while traveling maybe 10 mph so I could be wrong. It was much larger than a human print. I was very spooked by the experience and it didn't even cross my mind to take a picture of the prints. This was the first time I saw such a creature so my mind was not thinking about documenting it! Here is how I would describe what I saw. It was tall and had reddish brown hair, tending toward brown. The legs looked darker under the knee joints, looking back that was probably cause it was wet. The hair appeared to be long and shaggy. As it crossed the road the arms swung slightly, especially when going over the guard rail. The creature never looked towards me, it was looking towards the other side of the road at the tree line. If I had to guess, it was probably close to 7 or 8 feet tall. It was much taller than any living thing I had seen before. Its chest was large as well, almost like a body builder. I only saw it for a couple seconds as it crossed the road so that is the best I can remember. I really wish I had my dash camera installed at that point. I quickly put one on a couple days after that! Hopefully I will see another one day."

It was made in three separate calls getting louder than the last one. The last call was very loud. The first call almost sounded like a owl hoot but as it got louder I could tell it was coming from Chito park. There’s no way I could hear an owl call that far away and the last two were dead on/textbook Bigfoot calls. It happened at 10:30p.m. As the local temperature shifted."

We went hiking the day before and the ground was frozen solid from the weather. The following day we went hiking and it rained the night before. It was very cloudy all day and still pretty cold but the ground was thawing out. We decided to hike the Benton-MacKaye Trail off Highway 515. We started at 8:45 a.m. and followed the trail around to an open field and decided to take a quick break. While on  the break, I yelled as loud as I could twice and the echo was impressive. We continued following the trail for another 1 1/2 hours until we decided to head back. On the way back around the field, we noticed a huge footprint. It was obvious it was a footprint because you could see the toes in the clay. The clay wasn't hard nor was it wet and slick. We passed it on the way and had no walking troubles or saw the print. There were footprints around other than ours, however, we didn't see anybody from the start of the trailhead and throughout the hike.  We looked around for more and discovered 4-5 more tracks the same size, others that looked similar but less defined. It was a very deep print, looked to have 4 toes. It seemed to be walking down the hill towards the creek."

I went just a bit further to where the trail split and sat down to wait for deer before I got to my spot I saw another turtle that had been cracked around like taking the chocolate off the outside of a reese's cup. After setting in one place I started to hear oooop it was different tones in five different spots, 2 down below me to my left rear, 2 off to my right along the road and, 1 further down almost to the end of the marsh. The loader of the ooop was from the one at the end of the marsh and to two to my left. The 2 along the road sounded as if lower tones and up in the trees. I stayed there for about 15 minutes listening, some of the sounds vibrated through the valley. I stood up and headed for my rig when everything went dead silent no sound from anywhere but what I made. I walked along the trail for about a 100 yards I heard a crack as if a baseball bat hit a bat with a wosh, wosh, wosh and hitting the brush. Because I was hunting deer and nothing larger I continued on my way. I felt as if I had went the other way I would have seen something."

My wife woke me up around 1:30 am. She was giving me a hard time for the smell in the cabin (she thought I was passing gas). I told her it wasn't me. I had the window open and the fan was on blowing the cold air on me. There was this stench coming from outside. It was the most horrible smell I have ever smelled in my  life. It was a mix of nasty fecal matter (diarrhea) and body sweat/odor. I immediately shut the fan off and the smell started to go away. I didn't even think about going outside until later on in the morning about 10:00 am when we were eating breakfast. We hadn't mentioned anything to our kids but my son said he didn't sleep well the night before. He said he heard something outside of the cabin and thought it was probably a deer but he kept waking up feeling like something was staring at him through the window in the living room. Every time he would wake up, he'd look at the window. He said he thought for sure something was outside of the window staring at him. If indeed there was something or someone outside of the window staring at him then they would have to be at least 7 - 8 feet tall because the window is about that high off of the ground outside of the cabin. I didn't know if this incident was worth mentioning but I thought I would share it anyway. I did go outside and carefully searched the area around the cabin for any tracks but couldn't see any but our own and our dogs. Our dog was inside of the cabin sleeping in her crate in, the kitchen. She made no noise through the night."

The truck may have awakened me when he pulled in. I laid back down and few minutes later I heard brush breaking a couple of hundred yards up the hill, I thought it must be a bear or an elk. Ignoring the breaking brush I tried to go back to sleep then while still awake I heard a clear distinctive wood knock, very clear like a bat on an oak tree. I listened for another half hour or so and heard occasional brush breaking, I then fell asleep. I was then awakened at approximately 3:00 am by breaking brush that sounded much closer than before, followed by one clear knock from uphill and north of me 10 seconds or so later another clear knock further up the hill but to the south (two separate locations) I got up a little freaked out and drove north to Malad, Idaho"

I've grown up in Idaho around 18 years. I've hunted,fished and did all outdoor things like camping etc..  All over Idaho I have been outdoors and seen about every wild animals tracks,sounds and sign I thought was in this state. Before I found what I did I was a skeptic but not a believer  till this day.. I was living in Oregon at the time and had came back to visit family for the summer and spend my birthday with them, I was 24 at time. I went camping with 3 friend's that day. We got there around 2-3 in the afternoon. We set up our tents started a fire and we just sat around the fire talking until around 5. Then we decided to hike to the south east point of the rivers bend nearest to us. The hike there we had to go through lots of willows, brush,trees etc.. On the way there we ran into a cow moose and it had a calf moose with it. It was an intense stare down as I was not even 15 feet away from it and I could see it's hair on its back intensely sticking up as I started to move me and my friends around her. We got around here and ran into a young bull moose and found an old fallen down cabin. By the time we were done exploring around there we moved forward to the rivers end of the bend. I was at the front walking up on the bend point, it was thick with willows up until 15 feet from the flowing rivers water. That 15 feet was just pure sand all at the tip of this bend. I started to walk to the river's edge when I seen some huge prints walking out of the water up on to the sand bank about 8ft out of from the waters edge and then it walked slowly back into the water. It was one of the biggest most bizarre tracks I've seen and how they moved in and back in the water was just weird. I counted 10-11 tracks coming out of the water and back in the water. I wear size 12 shoe and my foot next to its foot made mine look small. It was approx 19in long and it looked just like ""a huge human footprint huge"". Its strides were over double mine and Im 6ft. I showed my friends and we looked for more tracks but that's all the tracks we could find was the ones coming from the water out of the water and into the water by that time it was starting to get dark and we needed a start the hike back so we started the hike back. It's something I've never seen and will never forget. That day I recorded the tracks and took pictures with my foot next to its foot but I of course lost the phone snowboarding in Bend the winter after. Its kinda creepy the unnatural sounds I've heard all over the mountains and woods across Eastern Idaho but never thought about bigfoot cause I had never found any FOR SURE tracks. PS.. the red line is the way we hiked and the black line is where it came in and out of the river."

The weather was a little foggy with a light rain. I had stopped the truck to look up a small ridge about 300 or so yards away.  I saw what looked like a very large Bigfoot standing at the top of the ridge near a tree.  I told myself that it was probably just a large stump that looked like a silhouette of Bigfoot on the ridge.  I even pointed it out to my 12 year old son, that that stump looked just like a Bigfoot.  We both laughed and agreed that it did. We continued up the little road for less than 100 yards, and found that it was a dead end.  We turned around and on the way down I looked back to where I saw the stump, and it was gone!. Less than 3 minutes had gone by. I stopped the truck and told my son that the stump was gone.  We searched the skyline and couldn't find it again. To this day, I really do not know what that was on the skyline, and I am not convinced that it was in fact a Bigfoot (I am a beliver), but it was something that I can not explain."
61107,Report 61107: Archery hunter describes possible stalking incident outside the town of Headquarters,Class B,2021-11-08T12:00:00Z,46.75905,-115.8545,2021,Idaho,61107.0,"I was archery hunting in Idaho not far from Headquarters Idaho, actually between Township Saddle and Township butte, when I encountered something that I have never experienced before in the mountains. I heard something heavy running ahead of me to my left as I was walking up on old railroad grade that has been used by 4-wheelers. My first impression was it may have been an elk, but I didn't see what was making the sound. I had walked about 1/4 mile from my partner and was closing in on an area where we had seen elk earlier in the week and thought I would try to push ahead to get into the area I had seen the elk. I was walking very quietly when I heard a sound that I thought was a bird flying overhead. I looked up since the sound came from in front of me, when I heard something hit a tree and then the ground behind me. As I turned around, I noticed a branch on a small tree behind me that was moving as if something had hit it.  Before I could walk back to the tree which was only about 15 feet behind me, the branch had stopped moving. There was no wind and it was very calm, and very silent. When I got to the tree, the only think that I found was a large chunk of bark that was laying on the ground. I found this to be unusual since it came off a large tree such as a ponderosa pine as the bark was about 14 inches long, about 6 inches across and about 2 1/2 inches thick. This area has been logged in the last 40 years and there were no trees in the area with a girth which would have produced bark of this size. At this point, it was getting late in the evening so I decided to head back to the 4-wheeler and my hunting partner. I called him on the radio to see where he was. He said he was waiting for me at the 4-wheeler, still about a 1/4 mile away from me. I found nothing else on the trail which would have produced this sound and was wondering if this could fall into the phenomena of others who have experienced similar situations. I was a bit cautious as I walked back down the trail but heard or seen no other anomalies."

After loading the kayak after our paddle, we drove ½ mile to the campground, only to find that it was closed for the season. Not wanting to find another campsite, we drove around the campground to the Tule Bay boat launch parking area, which was still open. We parked our vehicle, unloaded our tent, sleeping and cooking gear and began to set up camp, carrying things into a designated site that would normally be accessed by the campground road. I was a bit concerned about camping in the site after the campground was officially closed, but figured that as it was already getting dark, it was unlikely that we would be confronted by a ranger. It had been raining and was getting cold, and my wife wanted a campfire to warm up from our paddle to Upper Priest Lake. I didn’t want to start a fire, as I was still uneasy about camping there and concerned that a fire would attract attention to us. After setting up the tent and getting things situated, we heard a whoo call to the north of us, across the road. I had the distinct impression that it wasn’t an owl, but a person whooing for someone in the dark woods, like someone trying to contact a hiker who was late getting back to the car (though there were no other cars in the area). The call was quite loud, louder than any owl I have ever heard. Too me, it seemed like it was coming from something (a person) with large lung capacity. By this time, it was dark and we couldn’t see anything beneath the tree canopy outside of our campsite. While my wife worked on starting a fire with wet branches (unsuccessfully), I arranged our sleeping gear in the tent. Suddenly, we heard a WHOO call that was much closer and much louder. This call made us nervous as we both felt it was made by a person who was creeping around our campsite in the dark messing with us. But we had heard no vehicles drive in, saw no headlights or flashlights, and it was too dark and overcast for a person to drive or walk around the woods without a light. My wife has better hearing than I do, and heard what she felt was an answering whoo from some distance away in the forest. Grabbing a flashlight, I walked 75 feet or so back to our vehicle to get my 9mm pistol. There was no question that this wasn’t an owl. The call was much too loud and gave both of us a fearful feeling. I could feel the loudness of the call in my chest. We noticed that our dog had no reaction to the calls, remaining in camp and not acting scared, but I sure felt that way, even with a firearm on my hip. After the last loud call, we didn’t hear anything more the rest of the night. No vehicles drove into the boat launch parking area and we heard no people or animals about. In the morning, I looked around our campsite but couldn’t see that anything had been disturbed. Later back at home, my wife researched owl calls online, but couldn’t find anything that sounded like what we heard. Whatever had made those calls around our campsite that night knew we were there and had a lung capacity much larger than an adult human male."

My husband and small children were fishing at the loud creek. I'm an avid birder. Obsessed. I must know every call I hear. And that evening, I heard a call that sounded like an old fashioned crank police siren. It was echoing through the valley and came from a higher altitude. Howls of the same timbre and pitch, but slightly varying length. I thought it was an owl I must not know. Wolves and cougar don't sound like that. My dog didn't bark. She hid under the table. I also considered that maybe some kids were playing with an old police siren. But then I realized there was no way kids could have been way up near the ridge with something that heavy, plus, no one else was up there. When I got back into cell reception, I searched through owl calls and found nothing similar. But I found that call on the BFRO site. It was the Ohio howl."

I got up and went and looked and there was something on the road above us that was staring down at me don’t know what it was but it was there. This last weekend August 8 I heard three Whoops or long group calls over the sound of my music when I turn my music off I heard nothing I would like to give a verbal description of what I encountered so if you’re interested call me.

I don’t know how to start this off but here it goes: I am a 35 yr male disabled combat veteran (Iraq/Afghanistan) I’ve hunted this land for the last 5 years ish. It was the 9th of October and I had camp set up. Wife was getting off early and the kids were in school. They were coming to meet me there in the afternoon. I decided to go see if I could locate a small pocket of elk and shoot some grouse. I took my SxS down a normal trail that I somewhat frequent looking for my last 2 birds. It’s a old log road that dead ends. Immediately shot 1 soon as I got off the SxS. Got him and figured hey it’s a dead end, I’ll walk this and see if I can find fresh elk sign. I can show you on OnX where I was and can explain the terrain. Anyway, walked down maybe 1/2 mile at the beginning I kept jumping birds but always opposite of where I was. I went to the left the jumped 50-60 yards other side... get to a good opening and see a few wolf tracks. Big pile of bear shit. Decided to head back to check on my dogs and wait for the fam. Walking back was dead quiet as in awkward quiet no chirps no nothing, not like when I walked down. I got almost halfway back to my side by side and heard a knock... I know what a woodpecker sounds like.. I am not a believer (well idk now). So I thought maybe another hunter was in the timber so I speak out loudly “ohhh tree knocking huh!!!""  Then 2 knocks, I started laughing “Sasquatch is that you.."" silence for probably 10-15 seconds then 3 knocks no special order just odd timing knocks.  I make a joke of it “Have u seen any grouse I need one more” no answer, few seconds later knocks 2-3 maybe 4 .. I joke “ knock twice if your in New Hampshire (joking quoted anchorman movie) no knocks .. So I look thru my binos, not cheap shit, vortex viper 12x50... I looked for at least a min. One knock while I was glassing.. Started to feel really uneasy. Out loud said, ""Alright dude it’s not funny, at least wave a hand so I can see where you are! Again, I am grouse hunting with my 12gauge pump and don’t want to pepper someone when they're hid and I try to shoot a bird!"" Quiet for probably 30-45 seconds. I am glassing (thinking maybe someone put a blind up or something) but nothing. I unload my bird shot and put my 2 buckshots in followed by a slug. I tell them they're gonna get it and they need to show them self. Nothing, Was about to walk up the direction and just didn’t feel right. Kept my buckshot in and started to walk fast for the next 20 mins to my SxS. Got to my ride and still dead quiet... OK my area, potlatch land (timber company). I rode from camp 8.7 miles. Friday mid day. This is a dead end trail. I did not see anyone all day. No tracks, no tire marks, nothing. I know I was the only one out there. Went back to camp waited for my family. Told my wife and she said “You grew up in these woods. I don’t think you're crazy but I wasn’t there.” I am not crazy. I spend probably 7-8 months of the year in this area, never anything like this."

We were there for about an hour listening to the quiet and birds and other little critters, when we heard what sounded like someone hitting a home run with a wooden base ball bat. The sound came from the southeast of us, maybe about 100 yards away. We both look at each other and we agreed that was a tree knock. We continued playing our game. I noticed that after this the birds stopped chirping for a while. It was very quiet, very quiet. Then at  3:14 PM we heard another knock. This one appeared to be about 50-75 yards north of the first knock.  At this time I told my husband let's hurry up and finish our game and walk over the direction the knocking came from. We finished the game then walked about 20 yards at this time I decided to do a howl and then I did one tree knock. Within 5 seconds we heard a knock back. This one came from the same direction of the second knock but sounded farther away. At that time we decided we should go back towards the truck. As we started walking back, we heard a fourth knock this one came from the west on the other side of our truck. We walked back, past the truck and walked about  20-30 yards but heard nothing more."

The wind was light though.  About 5 minutes later it happened again but the knock sounded different and a bit lower. Within 10 minutes the Alaska truck drove by me with just a driver.  He headed down elevation from me. I continued to glass this area without a sound for a good 5 minutes. I heard a vehicle coming up the hill and that person stopped to talk to me.  He was a friend of mine from my old home town in California.  Small world.  I knew he liked this area and was happy to see him.  We started to compare our hunting apps on our phones. Come to find out he was camped about 1.5 miles from my camp. We talked for a few minutes and then a loud knock like I heard before.  A bit closer and near level to us.  He stopped mid sentence for a second and turned to the direction of the sound but kept talking. A truck came by with a family in it and stopped to talk. I told him the snow situation and he headed up.  He returned within 5 minutes and headed down the road to lower elevation. We heard 1 more knock lower and like further away (not as loud) after the truck passed us.  My friend said, ""What the hell is that??""   I joked, ""Bigfoot!""  He immediately said it is someone splitting wood. When we heard 3 more in the next 20 minutes I told him that wood cutter sure takes his time between splits. Then it happened....a knock behind us with a different tone and it seemed farther away..  Then another below and to our right but not as loud as the other knocks. Things went quiet for 10 minutes. We said see you later.  He headed up the road toward the snow line. It didn't take long and he was back and drove by me with a wave.  I have not talked to him since then. Within 5 minutes of him driving by me I heard 3 distinct quick clacks or knocks directly behind me up the hill. Like rock not wood. Then 1 faint wood knock below me.  I stayed for about 15 minutes in silence, then left. "

We were camping in the bed of our pick-up truck underneath a tarp.  During the night I awoke to the sounds of a large animal walking past the truck.  My first thoughts were that it was a moose because the impacts of its feet/hooves were those of a heavy animal.  I started to raise up to look and my fiance grabbed my arm and asked me to stop because she thought the animal would hear me.  The interesting part of this is that she is hearing impaired.  She was not hearing the animal walk by, what she told me later is that she heard the animal make a noise that she could not attribute to any animal she had ever heard.  She said she felt the sound more than heard it.  I should note that I never heard this sound being emitted by the animal, all I heard was the impacts of its feet.  After the animal walked away I laid down figuring I missed a good chance to see a moose.  Approximately 5 minutes later I heard three very distinctive wood knocks.  I had never heard this sound anywhere in the outdoors before this night.  The first time I heard this sound other than my encounter was on your Finding Bigfoot TV show."

The first was in July or August of 2002. It was one of those hot, and humid days of summer. Temperatures reached around 100 that day. So my then boyfriend, five year old daughter, his Rottweiler, and me decided to go to the river and swim at one of the many sandbars on the Embrass as some call the Ambraw. So our location was into an area that you would not see people just walking around or being out in. Very secluded very off the beaten path. We were swimming and eating lunch and hanging out when all of the sudden the dog starts going freaking nuts like I never seen. So I go up the incline on the beach towards where my truck was parked to see if maybe it was a farmer that had driven back there for some reason. The incline was steep enough that I could look across the grassy weedy tree area to the edge of a bean field where the truck was parked without anything of me being seen except for my head. When I looked over the edge of the bank right there in front of me, maybe 20 yards away, crossing through the under brush was something that my mind could not grasp. A thin black 7 to 8 foot man like creature. I was so in shock I just dropped down the bank. My boyfriend said what was it? I answered Sasquatch. Let's go!"

This just happened two days ago. I saw what I never thought I would see again, and how different this one was. Me and my friend was coming back from a road trip south when we decided to go down to a place on the Embarras River.  I like to fish and swim at what's called Spencer's Bridge. This used to be a county road that used to lead to a bridge that crossed the river, but the bridge is long and the area floods so much, no one uses it except for people fishing and swimming. I was going really slow because it had just been grated from the last flood. When in front of me I saw a fast dark moving object, it ran on all fours towards the tree line . When it turned south I could see that it was running on all fours as a ape would but fast. It stopped and turned towards us and you could see that it was dual colored, white on one side and brown on other, different yeah. It was too far away to get any more specific on the coloring but this one was much more heavier and hairier. Couldn't really see just how tall he was but his mass was a lot bigger than the last one I seen but that was in the dead of summer He turned and took one last look at us and disappeared into brush. This would of been about 5 miles from where I saw my first one."

The first name of the witness has been changed. Stan - Jim, can you explain what happened? Jim - When I was about 16 years old, myself and two friends were parked by the woods, weren't drinking or anything, which is an important factor there. I actually saw a hand come around a tree, like you were gripping a tree, or something, but a big furry hand. And being a kid I thought it was a werewolf, the first thing I thought. And I told my buddies and they looked but didn't see it a first. Not even a moment later a big, I didn't know what it was, a big furry head stuck around the corner, peeked at us, and went right back. It didn't charge us and it didn't move. And then we took off from there like wildfire, just flew out of there. But, that is something we never really talked about because we never knew what it was. Stan - What year would this have been? Jim - That would have been in about 1974. Stan - And in summer? Jim - Yes, it would be middle of summer. It was just one of those little Forest Reserve cutoffs where you pull-in, and your car is kind of almost in the woods. Stan - How tall was it? Jim - I would have to say eight foot range. The hand was up there high, that is what caught me off-guard. Stan - And what color was it? Jim - It was a blackish-brown, I just remember seeing a big hand. You would almost mistake it for a gorilla-type thing. It is something that is not natural in Illinois. Stan - And were you able to see the face? Jim - Yeah, have you ever played peek-a-boo with the kids? You know how you do that? It was kind of like that, it stuck around the corner and went right back. I just remember it wasn't a person, eight foot tall and it was all furry, but it wasn't a gorilla face. We thought it was a werewolf, because we were all kids."

I was still in a heavily wooded area. As we were driving something darted out in front of me, perhaps a block or so ahead, it ran across the street from left (north) to right.  I thought it could have been a person, but it ran across the street really fast, like someone with those fancy prosthetic legs.  As I approached the area, I slowed  down to see if there was someone there, but no person was in sight.

As I approached a hill that was just east of the Hagaman turnoff I noticed a tall reddish brown creature crossing the highway going north.  It was at least 7-8 feet tall and was in the standing position.  As I approached the area that I saw it cross I looked in that direction and it was no where in sight.  I want to add that there have been many sightings in this area.  It is in Macoupin County, Illinois and both of my sightings were in an area known as ""Hagaman Bottoms"".

I quickly stopped my vehicle to look at what I just saw but at that point my headlights were past the figure and I couldn't see anything.

47469,Report 47469: Memory told of possible vocalizations and footprints found near Atwood,Class B,2015-01-02T12:00:00Z,39.8352,-88.47835,2015,Illinois,47469.0,"The following incidents occurred between the years 1984 and 1986 around our woods which is located just south of the intersection of E300 N Rd 300 and county road 1425 Northwest of Atwood Illinois. At the time we lived in the 15 acre woods which is at that location. The Lake fork river runs just behind that woods and there is a bottom land just north of the woods which floods every fall. At the time I was a teenager and hunted, fished and trapped along a several mile stretch of that river. The encounters we had were not visual. The first instance was about 10pm on a winter evening when I was going to let our poodle out before turning in for the night. There was only what I could describe as a combination of a Scream/howl which came from just on the North side of the house. Our dog was so frightened it would not go out of the door. He was not afraid of anything and to see that fear in him was shocking. The volume of the howl was immense. My mother was home and heard it as well. Even from inside a well insulated Illinois home it sounded as if it was right next to you. I had the door open and it felt like I had been hit in the chest by the sound. The second instance was just south of that woods about a half mile down from where the river bends. I was returning from hunting about 5pm in the evening and heard the exact same howl. It came from the smaller wood which is right next to the river just south of our woods. The 3rd instance was a series of footprints along the bank of the lake fork river. Just to the west of the road intersection mentioned above, the lake fork passes under a bridge. Just south of that bridge the river bends and flows east. I was fishing along that bend on a spring day about 10 in the morning. I felt that there was something not right and then realized that there were no animal sounds. Typically there are all sorts of sparrows and red winged black birds, but there was nothing. I looked down as I was walking and noticed that I was walking next to a line of footprints in the mud. I wore mens size 12 hiking boots and these prints were 5 toed and 2"" wider and 3"" longer than my boots. They were very fresh with dirt still loose on the edge of the track. I looked up and down the river but did not see a thing. The river banks in that area are steep with tall grass. The forth instance was while deer hunting on the east side of the large woods just to the north east of that bridge. I had gone out bow hunting and had set up a blind on the east side of the woods. I had walked from our house and was set up in a blind in full camo by 45mins prior to sunrise. Just before light I heard the same howl which I estimated came from about 50 yards away to my north. It was so powerful that it shook me. I waited for several minutes and it howled again. Only having a bow and not a gun I literally walked backwards the few hundred yards back to the county road with an arrow knocked and ready to go. Not that it would have done any good. You could tell by the volume of the scream/howl that this was a very very large creature. The 5th instance was around 10:30 at night in the back of our house. We kept a large horse tank in the back where we would dump and burn trash. It was approximately 35 yards behind the house. I was taking the trash out and had just dumped it when I heard a ""Hmph"" from the edge of the tree line which was about 10 yards away. I head another ""Hmph"" and then something large taking off down the side of the hill towords the bottom land, I headed quickly in the house. The next morning I checked the area and could see the same size prints mentioned above. I couldn't see them clearly as before due to thick ground cover of leaves. The Howls around our house were heard by my mother. I do not know of any other people in the area having the same instances. at the time there were only 4 families living in that area. Us, my uncle who lived across the river, a family that lived in the house by the bridge and another that lived just east of the road intersection mentioned above."

49182,Report 49182: Memory told of a possible childhood encounter at Georgefield Barracks,Class B,2017-01-24T12:00:00Z,38.76417,-87.60555,2017,Illinois,49182.0,"In 1953 I was a 10 year old girl living in George Field (Barracks), IL. George Field was a WWII air base for pilot training & the barracks housed airmen and brass. After the war the Barracks were converted to civilian apartments & my family lived in one. George Field was in an extremely remote area between Vincennes, Indiana & Lawrenceville, Illinois. The Wabash River was east close to Vincennes and the Embrass River was west - the rivers approximately 20-30 miles apart. The Barracks were surrounded by miles of corn and wheat fields. Often during the night I heard high pitched screams like a woman being attacked or killed. My parents told me the screams were panthers – I never saw any panthers. My sisters and I walked the corn and wheat fields as often as we could. Old timers told us to be careful of the “Grassman” which I later learned was their name for Big Foot. I thought Grassman was like the Wizard of Oz Scarecrow. One night my parents went out and left me with my older sister (who has since passed away). She was always teasing, aggravating and pulling pranks on anyone foolish to fall for her drama! That night she came close and said to me “Judy, there is something outside the window. Seriously, there is a monster outside came to the window – listen, you can hear it.” To shut her up I moved to the window and listened. (Our windows were usually open because we had no air-conditioning) I could hear something large moving around and saw a large head in the shadows. It walked around all the windows trying to look in and went from the back of the house to the front. Meanwhile, our middle sister came home – I knew she’d be coming in the front door where the monster was. I gathered all my nerve, opened the front door, turned on the porch light and screamed to my sister there was danger out there. I found myself looking eyeball to eyeball with the “Monster”. I am now 71 years old and know it was Bigfoot, which I didn’t know at the time. It had honey blonde hair and beautiful amber colored eyes. We startled each other, but it had an “Oh Shit” look on it’s face. My sister who had just returned home came running toward it and it turned to leave. My sister and I looked at each other for a second and “Bigfoot” was gone – disappeared instantly. Neither I nor my two sisters ever talked about it – we all forgot it – never told our parents or anyone. My memory of this incident never came back. 61 years later I started watching your T.V. show “Finding Bigfoot” – I’ve always had an interest in these creatures. It was like someone threw a switch and I remembered. I asked mys sister if she remembered anything and it came back to her. She remembered me screaming and also her chasing this “Bigfoot” thing. She said she chased it because I was hysterical and scared to death. I asked her if she ever told our parents or anyone and she said “no, she had also forgotten about it.” How can this be after 61 years? I think we were both so terrified our minds simply suppressed what we’d seen and your T.V. show was the trigger that restarted my memory."

He had an encounter of something huge and making an un familiar noise he said he had never heard before. He is a 70 year old man and great guy. I recall laughing and making fun of him. Then the tables turned, I was in the woods alone hunting in the 2015 hunting season.I was in my stand and had several deer come in but they seemed very skidish. I drew my crossbow down on a nice buck and pulled the trigger. My arrow seemed to find its mark. I allowed about 45 minutes to go by and it began getting dark. As I climbed down out of my stand I began hearing some unusual noises. Kind of like I screaming growling noise. Now I'm soon to be 50 years old myself and as my father in law said to me. These were sounds that I had never heard before in the woods or anywhere else. I called my father in law and told him I had a deer down and asked if he could meet me out in the woods to help me get the deer out. He told me he was in Terre Haute Indiana, and that it would be close to an hour before he could even get home. I was too embarrassed to tell him I too was feeling pretty uneasy. I tried to keep him on the phone but he had to get off the phone.so I began tracking the deer I found really good blood. And was sure the deer didn't go far. As I started down a small hill I began hearing these noises again. It was as if I could feel these screaming growling noises in my body. I kept hearing what I thought may have been falling tree branches or something. I looked up on this hill side 30 yards from me and seen a sillhouette of something huge. I quickly headed out of the woods and continued hearing the noises all the way out. I called my father in law and told him about my encounter. He laughed and said you mad fun of me. We returned the next morning to find the blood trail  where I left off and we knew the deer had to be close due to the amount of blood. And then it was as if the deer just vanished.. We began working in circles to find nothing. There was a steep cliff to the east of where we found the last blood. We looked down torward the creek to find nothing. But the smell in the woods was as it was the night before. A very strong pungent odor. Kind of a cross of something dead and the urine of many different types of animals. I felt eyes on us the whole time we were out there. We went back several times without success. Then in April I went out to the same location mushroom hunting, I found that the woods was  very quiet. I didn't find any mushrooms so I headed out through the North end of the woods to look at deer sign. When it hit me, the smell it was so strong , I began hurrying to get out of the woods as I got to the edge of the woods to an area we call the  grassy area and there it was a foot print. A single foot print it was the left foot and was very large . The print was a good one very detailed you could see the toes and everything.I wear a size 13 and this print was way bigger than my foot. This area is about three miles from the Kickapoo state park in Vermilion county Illinois. I have never been frightened in the woods in all my life. I spent my whole life in the woods hunting most of every species in our area. I coon hunted in the dark by myself and never been as frightened as I was with this encounter."

What ever it was just stopped and stood there. Then it went back into the woods fast. Mom ran back inside the house with me by the wrist. She locked the doors and loaded a shotgun.

My friend was also in a hammock/tarp southeast of my wife's tent. After setting up our sleeping arrangements, we started a fire with some fell wood that we found laying around the site. Once the fire was going good, we say down and reconstituted some dehydrated food that we hiked in. We drank tea and ate until our bellies were full. Afterward, me and my wife went to bed, while my friend stayed up and played on her phone. After a few minutes, she went to bed as well. To be perfectly transparent, I want to share a detail which may be of use to critics, but I know better as it relates to my story. Where I had my hammock, walnuts occasionally fell from the tree and hit my tarp and rolled off onto the campsite grounds. This was a common event and one I'm used to hearing as an avid hiker. I'm no novice to forest sounds and behaviors. The night progressed and the fire burned out. I remember poking my head out of the cocoon and looking at the fire to see how dim it was becoming. Because the campsite was so remote, I knew it would soon be pitch black. I remember a walnut falling the tree and striking my tarp. It rolled off into the darkness and found its resting spot. The fire grew dimmer and dimmer until I grew bored of watching it. I zipped myself within the cocoon and fell asleep. Sometime later, a loud thud woke from my sleep. ""Maybe another walnut,"" I thought. Only it wasn't. It couldn't have been. Nothing ever hit the ground. Nothing rolled away off the of my pitched tarp. My heart raced. As I said before, I am an avid hiker/camper and I always look out of my hammock and under my tarp to see what's in the cap, but this time was different. I froze and couldn't move. It was like an involuntary fear that I've rarely experienced. I stayed that way until I calmed down, but never mustered the courage to look outside of my cocoon. The next morning, the first thing my wife tells me was that a bi-pedal creature was walking around her tent last night. My friend said, ""Mine, too!"" I tell them, ""Something slapped my shelter."" I go on to explain that it wasn't a walnut that fell on my tarp, because it never it hit the ground. My wife then tells us both that she heard two howls several minutes later and that they were about 15 minutes apart. According to her, the howl sound like a sign that paused at a very high pitch then broke into two small howls, then paused and two more small howls. That repeated itself another time. Me and my friend did not hear not, likely because we had fallen back to sleep. We left that campsite knowing we had an unexplainable experience. Although my friend is hesitant to believe it was the big guy, she does not deny that something with two legs was walking around her that night. As for me, I remain convinced that something slapped my tarp. My wife believes it was because I was a man, while her and my friend were female. Regardless, something with two legs entered our camp, in the dead of night, in pitch blackness, and left us unharmed, but fearful to look outside. We all shared that sense of fear and dread that we felt, but left the park not seeing the big guy, but at least two of us believing we were in close proximity to it."
67486,Report 67486: Possible vocalizations after midnight from cornfield near Wonder Lake,Class B,2021-01-09T12:00:00Z,42.38553,-88.35001,2021,Illinois,67486.0,"I was walking down my street and heard what sounded like a guy off in the cornfield yelling, approximately 600 feet away. It was sort of a grunting yell, very deep and it echoed through the neighborhood.  It sent the hair up on my neck and scared me a little because the only thing between me and the yelling was a row of houses. This is not the first time I've heard what I think might be a Bigfoot in the area. I have heard what seemed to be three of them sort of locating each other the week before Thanksgiving.  Again, I was out walking late at night in my neighborhood, around midnight.  I heard a fox call at the end of my block but that sound was cut off by what sounded like a woman trying to imitate her from a little further away. Then a few seconds later, a ""man"" let out a yell about 3 blocks away.  This yell was a deep guttural long yell, too long to be a human.  It made the hair on my neck stand up and it also echoed through the neighborhood.  Not a few seconds later, a faint ""howl"" came from what sounded like across the lake.  By this point, I had gotten back to my porch and entered the house to find all three of my cats wide eyed and standing in the middle of my living room.  Out of curiosity, I decided to go sit on my porch to see if the howls continued. The sequence of howls and yells continued on for about 20 minutes. First the ""woman"", then the ""man"", then the faint one across the lake until they were far enough away that loud vehicles drowned them out and I went back inside.  I wish I'd have thought to use my cellphone camera to record it."

71815,Report 71815: Law enforcement officers find and follow fresh snow tracks 33 miles NE of Moline,Class B,2018-02-14T12:00:00Z,41.71918,-89.91718,2018,Illinois,71815.0,"My name is Jerrod Reynolds. Years ago I was one of the biggest critics and thought that bigfoot was a spoof. I grew up hunting and fishing in central Illinois. My father who is a USMC Vietnam Vet taught me at a young age to hunt and track and pay close attention to my surroundings. After High School I joined the USMC infantry where I served two tours. One tour was Iraq in the Al Anbar Province where I walked point. My job was to read the lay of the land and look for anything out of place that was not natural to the surrounding terrain. The second was counter piracy operations on the coast of Africa in 2009. I am now 33 years old and I am a Police Officer and a Swat Operator in North Western Illinois. The first agency I worked for was right on the Rock River, and 3 miles from town is the Big Bend State Park which is over 1000 acres of wetland and forest. On Feb 13th 2018 around 11:00 PM I was given information about a stolen four wheeler which we recovered. During that time I was given information about a snowmobile that was stolen along the snowmobile trail right on the Rock River in between the town I worked for and the town a couple miles north of us. By the time I arrived on the river, it was now after midnight. Since the location of the possible stolen snowmobile was technically in the county jurisdiction, I was assisted by two county deputies. It just so happens that one of the deputies whom I've been friends with for a long time and had a bigfoot sighting of his own when he was a young man from 1981 which is currently on your website. This Deputy and myself have worked together as police and swat for 3 years by this time, and we have a good working relationship where we can feed off each others movements and know when something is up just by our demeanor. We knew where the stolen snowmobile was ditched so we made the plan for one Deputy to walk the snowmobile trail from the North, I would go directly along the river, and my friend would come in from the south off the snowmobile trail. We figured given the location that we would all converge on each other and one of us might come across the snowmobile at some point. There was a lot of snow on the ground this time of year and we knew we were in for a hike. As I walked along the river I could see the river was frozen over and I came to a tree line that ran East and West and was used almost like a water way for field drain off into the river. As I approached the tree line I heard a loud crash and running through the trees. My first instinct was that I kicked up some deer that were bedded down. The thing that stood out to me was the sound was like a heard of bulls crashing into the back of a stock trailer. The foot falls where very loud like whatever it was had some weight on it. At this point I thought nothing of it and continued walking. I walked around the tree line to where it stopped in the field to the west. I immediately found tracks that did not make since to me. I should know better given my background but I decided to walk into the tree line and investigate. What I discovered, I was not prepared for. I found tracks that looked like a human foot. They were about 15 inches long and there were three sets, two large sets and one small set that were about 8 inches long. Like many times before overseas, the hair on the back of my neck stood up and I could not put my finger on it, but I knew something was off. \ As I stared at the tracks trying to process what I was looking at, my buddy sounded off wanting to know where I was, and there was a mild hint of concern in his voice. I said ""I'm in the tree line, I have something to show you"". He replied, ""I have something to show you too"". As he entered the tree line my friend whipped out his camera and we began taking pictures. The foot prints were distinct. You could see the heel and the ball of the foot as well as toe imprints. I could tell from the tracks that they were running. Some of the tracks had drag marks on the toe portion and had some wisp marks from the hair which made course, distinct marks in the snow. When I finally accepted what I was looking at, I knew that these were big foot tracks and I had come feet from seeing them first hand. Unfortunately I did not see them with my own eyes, I just heard them. By then I had an adrenalin rush and wanted to keep following the tracks. My friend knew it was a bad idea and said we need to back out now. Looking back on it he was 100% right. The tree line led straight to the river and it was a perfect pinch point for an ambush. We backed out of the tree line and went out into the open field. There we discovered more tracks they were the same as ones in the trees, but since it was a corn field that was harvested the previous fall we could determine that the tracks which were in a straight line had a five foot span between prints. We could measure it since the corn rows were on 30 inch rows when they were planted. We were able to put together that one of the bigfoots went out of the tree line which we believe was to scout ahead to cross the field to the West and go to another tree line which would lead directly to the state park. The tracks went a little north but stopped as if the big foot observed the deputy coming from the North. The tracks then went South until they stopped facing the direction my buddy was coming from the south. Then turned around and ran by me straight into the tree line. When the tracks went back to the tree line we found the tracks from the other two. They appeared to be panicked and we could tell they were running almost in circles. The little tracks would disappear then reappear again. That would tell me the little one was being picked up and carried then put back down. At one spot where the tracks were going in circles and the little tracks appeared again, we found a little spot of urine. The tracks then went back east to the tree line and met up with the other set of tracks. We knew we needed to get out of there, so we took a few more photos and got out quick using a bounding method that way both our backs were not turned at the same time. The other deputy that came from the North, who we told about the tracks and seen a couple of them himself, thought we were full of it, but he was sure in a hurry to get out of there and went back north to his squad car. Later that night I was still in disbelief as we went back to the my Police Department. My buddy asked me, ""In all the years of farming and hunting, have you ever came across anything that didn't make sense?"" I told him a few years ago right around the same time of year before I was a cop, I was checking cattle on the same river about 4 miles east of where we were that night. I was on the four wheeler and the ground was froze, but there was no snow. I was checking the cows in a 400 acre field the the river wraps around. I found a cow laying in the middle of the field. When I got close to it I realized that it was dead. I know from growing up on the farm that coyotes eat from the back end and tear everything off the bone. The hide on this cow had not even been touched and it was not ate on at all.  At first I thought It must have been sick and died that night.  When I walked to where the head of the cow was I noticed that the chest was ripped open and everything inside the cow was gone, it was an empty cavity. I found it odd but not even thinking, I figured it was coyotes. I remember dragging the cow off to be disposed of and it was froze and stiff but the head was flopping around. I realized that the neck was broke but then again, I thought nothing of it. When I got off duty that night I was not able to sleep, and remember shots of adrenalin running through my body. Since then I am a believer and I know that bigfoots exist. My fiancé and I recently purchased 53 acres of timber property right next to the state park just south west of where the tracks were found. I have heard stories that there has been sightings on this road in the years past. So in tradition we named our property Squatch Valley Farm.  and we are not ashamed to admit that we know they exist. Having said that I purchased for my fiance and I, two Marlin 45-70's just in case. Since that night the tracks were found, my buddy and me have both switched police departments. We work for the same agency now and as luck would have it we are on the same shift. Also we still have the photo's from that night."

About 1:00am we both were asleep and were woken by a loud hollering noise. It was a very deep howling noise but it wasn't a dog or coyote. The howling noise was very long and very close to our camper. Whatever it was made the howling noise twice and something off in the distance mimicked it both times. There was no barking afterwards and the noise was too loud and too deep to be a human. We both stayed awake for awhile and didn't hear anymore noises.
65589,"Report 65589: RECENT: Knocks heard in daylight near Spurgeon Hollow Lake, 10mi N of Salem",Class B,2020-06-12T12:00:00Z,38.71342,-86.04386,2020,Indiana,65589.0,"My Fiancé and I decided to hike the Spurgeon Hollow Loop Trail in Washington County Indiana. The Trail is a 9-mile loop starting at Spurgeon Hollow Lake looping north towards Delany Creek State Park then continuing east and south connecting to the Knobstone Trail. (The Knobstone Trail is rugged state-maintained trail that winds approximately 60 miles through the Southern Indiana hills). The trail then turns west diverging from the Knobstone Trail to return to the trailhead at Spurgeon Hollow Lake. The Spurgeon Hollow Trail is situated in the middle of the Washington-Jackson State Forest. The Spurgeon Hollow Trailhead is reached from a county road a few miles off state highway 135, then a half mile off the county road down a dirt/gravel lane crossing through a couple of dry stream beds. We arrived around 1:30 pm on Friday June 12, 2020. It was a sunny day with low humidity in the upper 70’s (which is why we chose to hike this day). From the trailhead the path continues for a quarter mile or so and parallels the lake on your right and steep thickly wooded hills on your left. At this point, the trail splits to begin the Loop. You can go left up the steep hillside (several hundred feet climb) or continue on your right along the Lake. On this initial Trailhead path, I heard two distinct knocks. We had gone most of the quarter mile. I heard the first sharp knock. Then a second or two later, the second knock. Both in the same general area – up the steep slope to the left. I stopped at the looked, but could not see anything because of the dense vegetation. There was no other sound. The knocks were sharp and moderately loud. They sounded like the report of a baseball coming off a bat. There were no other people on the trail. No one at the Lake. My Fiancé stopped and looked back at me. I asked her if she heard those knocks. She of course made fun of me and said “Oooo it’s a Squatch”. She hadn’t heard anything. We continued on. We took the left trail up the steep slopes and for the next 6 miles went up and down steep inclines and declines. Crossed several creeks. Then about 3 hours later, the trail turned left diverging from the Knobstone Trail heading back towards Spurgeon Hollow Lake. The trail at this point parallels a large creek bed at the bottom of hills. We had gone a mile or so (about 2+ miles to go to reach the Trailhead). There was a knock. A very loud, very sharp knock. We both stopped dead. My fiancé’s eyes were wide as saucers. She said “that was loud”. I laughed and said “so what do you think that was?” The knock sounded again like the crack of a baseball coming off a bat. A huge baseball and a huge bat! It came from the steep hill top above us. We scanned the ridgeline, but could not see much. It was just too thick. I heard the brief sound of something moving in the brush up high, but that was it. My Fiancé said “Let’s Go”. I asked her “don’t you want to stay and see if something else happens?” She said “No I want to Go”. So we starting walking. A couple of times I would stop and scan the hills. She would say “Just keep walking”. We returned to trailhead with no further incident."

62352,Report 62352: Group of fisherman with a possible sighting of whitish/grey creature outside Neosho Falls,Class B,2017-04-17T12:00:00Z,38.176,-95.3465,2017,Kansas,62352.0,"One night while fishing with 2 friends on a creek outside town, it was nearing 11:00 pm. pitch black night. Fish were biting decent. But to pass the boredom my one friend found 2 sticks laying on the bridge.  In a humorous way he started beating them together. To join the fun I made a very odd whoop sound just for giggles. He put the sticks down and we went back to fishing. A couple minutes passed by and we heard what seemed an identical echo to the absurd noise I made. The sound was roughly half mile across a field and in a patch of timber on other side of field. I first thought it was another fishing friend playing a game with me so I made another whoop back. It was quiet for approximately 5 minutes. Then it whooped back again. To keep the fun and none the wiser I whooped back again. We waited. Then it made a whoop back. Only it was clearly out of the timber in into open field. Startled I told my friends that its on this side of the river which was just quarter mile down the creek we was fishing on. Still not sure what was talking back I whooped again. Then it proceeded to whoop back after I would wait a few minutes and be 50 yards closer every time. It oddly reminded me exactly of calling in a Spring time tom turkey. So I told my friends ill do it a couple more times but if it keeps getting closer I'm going to stop. And it kept getting closer every time it whooped. I finally told my friends it's probably 200 yards away. There is a little ditch draining into the creek between us and it so I felt safe but we were was startled enough that we packed everything we were fishing with on the bridge. We put our stuff into the buckets to leave in a hurry but we stayed on the bridge. I remember that this night we were not armed, oddly. So I told my friends if it comes closer imma reel my pole up and ""whip the shit out of it"" hahaha. Then right after that I got a bite on that pole. I hooked it reeled it up and got it on the bridge. It was a carp maybe 5 lbs. as all 3 of us are looking at this fish I just caught debating on keeping it or not the whoop returned. Only it was no more then 50 yards away just across the ditch from us. That was enuf for us. We put the fish back, grabbed our poles and buckets, grabbed our fish and loaded everything into my truck. We then stood by the vehicles with doors open lights on and ready for immediate escape. We stood with flash lights pointed on the only opening in the trees along the ditch. We could hear the thing walk 100+ yards up the ditch, cross over and walk back down towards us. With lights on we knew the footsteps were about to be right through our beam of light. Anxiously waiting what we saw puzzled us all together. it appeared to be the top of a head, maybe 4 inches of it. Hairy but it was whitish grey. This thing has been quiet for about 20 minutes at this point. It walked by with only showing the top of what I assume was its head. Headed to where the ditch met the creek and stopped. We could feel it staring us down, looking at us. Then out of nowhere it let out the biggest loudest cleanest whoop not 20 yards infront of us. It was down on the bank behind tall grass but we knew it was looking right at us when it did it. At the instance of the last whoop we flew into the vehicles, started them in gear and tore out of there before the starters stopped turning. We went up the road to the open field and blacktop to discuss what the hell just happened. We then went home and I told my ol lady what had happened. She was thinking we were crazy. We grabbed the gun and went back near where we were fishing, hoping to see it again. It was silent from then on. The next day me and one of my friends went back out in the daylight to see what had happened. I walked up to where we saw the head top and realized, it was a steep bank down to the ditch. Right where we saw the head top was a tree laying down. roughly 18"" starting to decay but still firm. I stood on it and asked my friend, who was standing in the spot we saw it from, if he could see me. He replied ""no"". I stretched my hand way up as far as I can. He yelled, ""I can see your fingers."" I cut hedge posts for a living so I am well aware where 7' stands next to me. This thing was over 7' tall. I told my cousins about it and they didn't believe the absurd sound I made but a few days later they were fishing in the same spot we had been and they heard the sound. It came from the opposite direction where it came to us from but they instantly new I wasn't lying, and mind you I was born in Missouri and moved to Kansas and I am an avid hunter and fisherman. I have never heard anything so preposterous of a sound as that night, but it only mimicked my exact sound, which puzzles me even more."
46334,Report 46334: Guy exploring creeks finds tracks then growled at by large dark figure 10mi northeast of Russellville.,Class B,2014-06-18T12:00:00Z,36.91533,-86.73543,2014,Kentucky,46334.0,"On June, 18, 2014 I set out to find where two creeks merge back in the woods. On the left of a old wagon road i noticed a 17 inch footprint at the edge of the road/path. A few feet farther another 7.5 inch footprint next too a tree about 3 feet high on the bank overlooking where the creeks merge. Left my casting material in the truck; therefore, decided to walk back after taking pics.  Sunday afternoon the 22nd and after a few days of rains went back a different way. While walking next to the woods in a corn field i heard something trailing me in the woods. Determined it was somewhat large with all the noise it was making breaking  branches and logs on the ground. Went past the location where the creeks merge and doubled back. Walked towards the creeks and noticed a footprint in the field. The toes section was gone but the other 2/3rd of the foot was still there. A small print was on the back right side of the adults heal print about 2.5 to 3 inches long. Placed my backpack next to the print because no others around. The farmer had cultivated the field. Walked to the creeks and chased something into the creek. It was large by the sound of the splash, like a belly busted splash sound. It ran off and started making growls. It would do a growl  then a second later do another growl. Then a few seconds 5 to 10 seconds of silence then another set of two growls. Did this for eight sets of growls and then i did a whoop, after that whoop... silence - not another sound. Spent days looking for growls like what i heard and on Legends Beware a video taken on 12/July/2013 at the counter mark of .18 and especially 1.40 is the growl. I have been back and left peanut butter but no other tracks except a lot of deer tracks.

He called me to see if I would be interested in riding on his friends property on four wheelers, I told him yes and showed up. We arrived at his friends farm with 3 four wheelers plus his friends quad which made 4 quads total, time was 21:00 eastern time. There were 5 of us that went riding 4 males one female which was my friends girlfriend. After riding for an hour on this guys farm we went to this place they call *******, its south of Berea off of US25.  Its easily a few thousand acres of undeveloped land.  We ride with no incident for an hour or so, around 2230 at night we decide to head back to the farm we left earlier in the night.  As we were heading out we stopped so everyone could catch up because some had utility quads and some had racing quads, as we waited was when the first incident took place, as we sat we heard a branch snap like it was being deliberately snapped to let us know we were not alone, it was about 50 yards to our left in thick brush, we sat there quiet and just waited to see what would happen next, I have hunted deer before and it did not sound like large game traveling thru brush, it was a single snap, no brush or leaves moving like when a animal walks, also you heard no noise at all, dead silent, insects stopped making noises, you could hear a needle drop. We decided at this point to move on, it was a strange incident but not alarming yet...  We rode up the trail about a quarter mile to half mile and stopped at a clearing in the woods to just talk, we were all present, we spoke abit about that branch and just other general things when out of no where a large, extremely large log was hurled from up the hill next to my friends four wheeler at the base of the hill, the log was a good sized log, I stood up and looked up the hill but as soon as I did this massive lime stone slab was hurled toward the same friends four wheeler and barely missed him, at this point you heard loud thumps and branches breaking like something was running down the hill with alot of weight, at this point everyone started their four wheelers and we sped out of there.  We haven't gone back since.  I am not a believer, I thought sightings were hoaxes before that night but now I cant explain what that was and I'm not ruling out the possibility that it could have been bigfoot."
50318,Report 50318: More strange incidents reported from an old Farmplace near Blaine,Class B,2015-10-21T12:00:00Z,38.05344,-82.5446,2015,Kentucky,50318.0,"This is a follow-up report. It is about the 50 lb. dog food a week, and the x tree marker I found by my deer stand in early fall of 2015. First the dog food. I moved my game cam to see if I can figure out why so much dog food is has been missing. No surprise there. Just pics of me and the dogs. What is surprising is I haven't had to buy any dog food for around three weeks! Again this is down from a 50 lb. dog food bag a week to a 50 lb. bag bought over three weeks ago and the only thing changed is the camera. The other thing is what some call a tree marker. I found this in early Oct. When I went to check on my deer stands. It is made out of two large branches that cross to make a x shape. It also has a twig in the middle that is y shaped upside down. One end of the big branches is stuck in the roots of one tree and the other end is supported by the branch of another tree. The other branch that makes the x has one end stuck in the ground and the other in a branch on another tree (the one with first branch stuck in roots) with a smaller branch put in to hold it. When I first found the x marker the leaves had started falling and I found three of different colors and put them on center twig half way down the y. The next week they was gone. Ok no big deal. Before leaving I put an apple in the crook of the tree the x was on out of reach of deer and placed three more leaves on the y twig, made sure they would stay by breaking the y's end. The next week I went back and no leaves and apple is gone. Maybe some other critter got the apple, I don't know, My game cam is still on dog food. Anyway I left another apple a jar of pb and tied on a piece of blaze orange string on the x. This time a couple of weeks go by and some friends and I go riding and I asked if they would want to see the x. It was night, we rode to the x, apple was there but the peanut butter was missing. We looked around and couldn't find it. I said look for tracks, none found, so we checked out the x and my friend found a hair on the x marker. We went back home and she pulled the hair out of her pocket so we could check it out. It is an inch long and curly but the weird thing is its clear looking. I still have it and pics of the x marker, however what gets me is when I went hunting on the 21st of Nov. I went to the stand by the x marker (10 ft away) and the jar of peanut butter was on my stand with the lid on it and 2/3 missing!! I am the type that has to see or have real good proof of bf before I believe. However a lot of strange stuff has been going on around here and I wanted to share."
50746,Report 50746: Possible aggressive behavior at new rural cabin site near Stanton,Class B,2015-12-22T12:00:00Z,37.53918,-83.46014,2015,Kentucky,50746.0,This is the second incident I've had at my family's property in Stanton Kentucky. The first one was scary and all (had a rock thrown at my dads truck and made a huge crash in the dark) but this one has basically scared me away from my parents house at night! This was right before Christmas and we had record high temps close to 70 so I was hanging out on their front porch. Last time I was there I smacked some wood planks together and got a response so I figured I would try again. So I stood up and grabbed a piece of wood (we just built their deck so there are pieces laying around) and hit the hand rail of the deck 3 times very slow. I waited not even 15 seconds and got 3 hits back. I was shocked because it sounded like it was no more then 50 feet away. My mom and dad keep a big spotlight style flashlight right by their front door because I refuse to get out of the car without them shining the light for me lol. I'm a chicken I know. But I ran and grabbed the light and started shining it along the woodline and saw tree branches moving... There was no wind so I know something had to be there. Well I went back in freaking out and sat on the couch... I waited about a hour and went back out and was just standing there and heard footsteps off to the side of their house. Again no more then 50 feet away. This time I didn't get the light because I didn't want it to run away... I sat out there for probably 15 minutes and something walked basically back and forth the whole time. I tried to take a video with my phone but it just sounds like someone breathing...
57777,Report 57777: Early morning visitor forces couple to flee camp near Gilbertsville,Class B,2017-06-28T12:00:00Z,36.92799,-88.12511,2017,Kentucky,57777.0,"This is my Facebook post. Copied and pasted. Occurrence was inside Land Between the Lakes National Forest, Hillman Ferry Campground at Campsite B 43. Well. I made sure we secured the most backcountry spot where you can dump camp. I wanted away from loud people. So it is empty and quiet; covered with plenty of trees. So at about 4am, I wake up, instantly. I ask my wife what's the matter. She simply whispered she was scared. I ask about what. She said she heard noises out in the woods. Now normally, I would ask her to go back to sleep, that there's nothing wrong. But this time. Suddenly, about maybe five or six owls start hooting. And they're going non stop, back to back. Then the coyotes begin howling with them. And then every bird wakes up and begins their story. They go on continuously for about thirty seconds. Suddenly, they all stop. And so I know this is completely unusual. Then we hear it. Clump, Clump, Clump, Clump. Branches were breaking, wood was cracking with each step. And I'm like okay, that's a biped. But a human, unless it was intentionally trying to be frightening, wouldn't be tromping around. And an adult would know and expect people to have firearms. Also, the terrain would be too difficult to simply decide to go for a stroll in the woods in the middle of the night, with no guarantee to meet somebody to scare. During the day, the forest is too dense for hunting. I know there are no bears, I know it's not a deer, or any other woodland creature that is common here. So. It keeps getting closer and closer. So I cough really loud. No change in its cadence. It sounded like how I would sound walking through the woods. Heavy and sweating, full of complaints. These steps were loud. So I get out. The flashlight is in the truck. I go to the truck and rummage around for it. And I'm naked, carrying a knife in my mouth, searching through the vehicle. So I find it, and then start searching the treeline. I see nothing. But the steps stop. So, I start up the vehicle and point it towards the woods. I turn on the high beams. Nothing. I get out, turn off the lights. Start to head back to the tent, and then suddenly: Boom, boom, boom. It runs off. Tree limbs were breaking, trees were swaying. And I could hear it exhale as it ran. Sound like a combination of a boar and a man. And so, if you're familiar with Land Between the Lakes, there's a huge dogman or big foot phenomenon here. Tons of stories on YouTube about here. So I don't know. We both experienced it. Pretty crazy."
61097,Report 61097: Passenger has a possible evening sighting in Sandy Hook,Class B,2018-10-18T12:00:00Z,38.0311,-83.1815,2018,Kentucky,61097.0,"My husband and I are visiting family in Sandy Hook. On the evening of the 18th, at about 7:30, we got in the car to make a quick run to Sandy Hook. It was very cold, (it was already dark as well), so he started up the car to let it warm before we took off. As we were waiting, he called his grandmother -- because of the call time on his phone, we know what time this all occurred. While he was talking to her, his low fuel light came on, and they wrapped up the call at 7:45. We pulled out of the driveway and headed down the road. He was going a little faster than normal because we were a little nervous we'd run out of gas if we dilly-dallied too much. As we got into the curve about a quarter of a mile from my mom's house, I spotted something in the hollow ahead of us. It was almost out of the range of his headlights, and by my calculations, about 75-100 feet away from us. Now this all happened very very quickly, but because I am observant, especially when it comes to spotting deer crossing the road, I was able to make this observation within a couple of seconds. What I saw first was presumably an animal standing on the edge of the opposite lane. I leaned forward and scrutinized closer. Just before I could scream out, ""DEER IN THE ROAD!"" the creature began to walk very quickly, and at that moment I realized it had two legs, not four. At some point I started screaming, ""Turn on your brights! There's something in the road!"" All the while, I'm looking at this thing which is very big in stature, thick legs, thick abdomen, and (again by my calculations) at least 7 ft tall. It was the color of a tree, specifically the trees in that area, so like a grayish-brown, very earthy-tone. The area where I assume a face would be was lighter in color, but I couldn't tell what color. I know this because it turned its head and looked straight at our car. My husband saw movement and he saw what he described as a strange shadow, but he did not see the creature. Only I saw the creature, and in fairly good detail. Again, it happened so quickly though, I didn't get to see feet, hands or facial details like eyes and mouth. One thing I thought was interesting was the direction it was coming from. It was coming from a very tall and steep mountain, and when it hurried across the road, it must have gone off a very steep cliff, as that is the only place it could have gone. This cliff drops off onto Pruetts Fork Road, which is also very wooded and secluded. After we came back from our errand, we drove slowly and tried to inspect the area, but came up empty handed. That night, the neighborhood dogs were behaving very strangely, barking and howling all night long. One of them even acted as if he could see something in the distance, and began to growl and stalk before he took off to chase it. It was a very weird night."

I believe they have always frequented the hardwoods across the street, but since the recent logging of thousands of acres of pine in the area they have taken up full time residency across the street. There is a large swamp that butts up to the hardwoods. The night of January 21st, 2017 was the most incidental of all so far. After making some calls on my front porch I got a wood knock from the woods across the street. My dog ran toward the activity and barked for a long time. When I heard his collar stop jingling and the barking stopped I got worried and went into the woods with a large limb. I beat against a large oak and yelled ""I want my Dog!"". I heard a woodknock close by then a chest beat and a bluff charge through the brush. Then a tree push down. I yell roared ""I want my Dog!"" and beat hard against the tree. I saw eyeshine ahead I I told him to back away so my dog will come to me and we will go home. He did and my dog came out and we went home."

As it got closer, it started to walk faster.  As a life long hunter, I at first told her not to worry, it's a squirrel or something.  As this creature got closer, my ears and experience told me that this was a biped, only 2 feet crunching through the leaves.  My wife was so freaked out that we had to leave immediately before I could investigate more. Fast Forward to 2006, I was driving to work one night for the 2300 job in East Deerfield, MA.  I remember I was running a little late, so I was probably speeding, and the time would have been 2230ish.  It was raining lightly.  In West Charlemont, at the end of so-called Tea Street Extension, there is a bridge that carries the road over the railroad tracks. This is about 2-3 miles (the way the bird flies) from the encounter above.  What I saw was something standing perfectly still behind the guardrail.  It was about 6, maybe 6 and a half feet tall, had long brown hair all over it's body, and was stock still.  I drive this route almost daily (or nightly, in my case) for over 12 years, I know what belongs and what doesn't.  This did not belong.  I turned around and went back, and it was gone.  Being late for work, I turned around again and went to work.  I have never had any doubt that I saw a Sasquatch.  I haven't reported it because I don't want people to think I am a crackpot.  I just recently told my father about it, who told me to look into any organizations such as yours."

I am 64 years old and have been hiking and camping ever since I was about 12 years old and I have seen and heard many things in the woods.

You can watch the 8 min video on my blog if you like. www.hikingwithtom.com I always record our adventures on video but this time I decided to run an MP3 recorder all night and get the sounds of the night, I did get what I think was a bobcat walking up to my tent but around 2 AM I was awake again because it was very cold and hard to sleep. I was only half awake when I heard a real loud noise but not awake enough to really tell what it was except that it was a good ways off, I knew I was recording audio so I noted the time so I could find it on my recorder and went back to sleep, or at least I tried too. When I got home I found the sound on my MP3 recorder and it sounds a lot like a wood knock but judging by the amount of echo and how loud it was from so far away It had to be something real big that made that noise. I do not think even Babe Ruth could swing a bat fast and hard enough to make that sound.    The sound is int the video my blog. www.hikingwithtom.com  It sounded like it was a good half mile a way..

Approximately half a mile on the Cheshire Harbor Trail, close to Rockwell Rd, my wife and I heard a clapping sound.  We stood in place for a few moments, listening to the sound.  The ""clapping"" was non-rhythmic, sometimes there was one or two, other times there were many ""claps"".  In between the ""claps"" there was sounds of something walking, breaking fallen branches as it moved.  The sounds were about a distance of 100 feet from our position on the trail, within a thicker patch of woods.  We listened for almost a full minute and then decided to continue on the trail, moving closer to the source of the sound.  When we reached the area where we believed the clapping sound to be coming from we listened again and heard nothing and had seen no movement.  Further down the trail I attempted figure out the sound.  I did some tree knocking and banged rocks together, but only when I clapped my hands did it most closely match the sound my wife and I had heard.  It was a sound that I have never heard before and it has sparked my interest into figuring out what animal made this noise."

We hiked over one large hill and the wind was lessening but we realized the whistling was closer and then there were whooping noises and calls along with the whistles. The calls were going back and forth and I realized we were surrounded. We kept talking loudly hoping to scare off any animals and kept my bear spray in hand for the next mile or so.

We think he was alerted to the fox and coyotes that were making a little noise. They normally make more but they weren’t as active. Some of the cows and dogs on the farms surrounding us were making noise like they normally do also. We quit talking and about 2 minutes after that a gut bellowing howl, roar and scream type of sound came from across the street from our house on the ridge. About 15 seconds after the first sound the same type of howl started up again then it went quiet dead quiet. The fox and coyotes went silent along with the dogs and cows and they normally don’t. They will keep on til the wee hours of the morning. I got my coyote call out and attempted to get the thing to make the howl again but it wouldn’t. I tried to get the coyotes to make noise but they wouldn’t even call back to my call and that’s what struck me as weird. I’m an outdoor guy. I’ve heard coyotes, bobcats and bears.

These things were 12'' long and the stride between steps was measured at 8 feet! The line of prints was straight, just like you see with other evidence of a bigfoot trail! It was INSANE. There were no other prints around, I followed these about a quarter mile into the depths of the woods and off the beaten path. The snow was up past my knees at some points but how could I stop following this epic trail! I could see some prints more clearly than others, I could see toe outlines and the heel in a few!

I am from Connecticut however I have spent years in desolate oilfields across the U.S. including places like West Texas, the upper Peninsula of Michigan, and the Everglades of Florida. I have a vast knowledge of wildlife as I have always taken an interest to it and spent years IN the forest. My point is, what I experienced this day has shaken me to the core as I know my encounter was nothing ""normal"". In the Northwoods of Maine in a town called Greenbush, (population 1,400) I purchased 80 acres of wilderness with virgin forest on the back half of the lot. (meaning not even loggers have been there, it's that desolate.) I had rented an excavator and for this entire day I had been cutting a road through swamp, hills and forests to a high hill I call Hope Hill on the virgin most desolate corner of my land where I want to build my cabin. I had made it halfway and in the swamp I realized I was out of fuel. I shut down the machine and get out. I step down onto to road and was admiring my work and just relishing in the whole idea of pioneering this new path. Suddenly about 50 yards into the tree line I hear a bang with a stick on to a tree. Like someone was hitting a wooden bat against a large tree trunk as the percussion was unmistakable... At first I thought ""Oh crap there is a moose"" because it is mating season for them and they are known to ram their antlers against trees to intimidate their foes. Suddenly, the sound happens again. Now I am certain this is no moose as no branches are breaking, there is movement, no grunts, nothing... Just this wooden thump just through the trees where I can't see. I begin walking further away because I'm obviously freaked out. Again, but now 2 knocks... I grab a large branch I had just ripped down with the machine and smacked it against a large tree trunk. Immediately I received a knock in response. I wait around 45 seconds.... I knock again, BANG it knocks right after me again... I knock again 5 seconds later, it responds again right back.... Now I am shaking because I know what I presume this creature to be. It's obviously strong because the bang was very loud. Intimidating... I knew there was a certainty I was interacting with Sasqauch. I went back to my trailer on my qaud which was parked about 200 feet down the trail. I FLEW home. I calm down, now I am questioning reality and am quite, scared I guess. This is my land, I'm only halfway through making the road, these are my thoughts, so I decide to ride back... I knock again. It responds. I take my phone out. Turn on record on video, I knock, it goes away... Almost as if it knew I was recording. Regardless it was incredibly perplexing. I got back on the quad and went back home knowing for sure what I just experienced was legitimate. I brought a feather bead string thing from a dream catcher and brought it out there as a gift. It's been 3 days. I haven't gone back to see if it's still there."
67335,"Report 67335: Knocks heard near Spectacle Pond, 27 miles east of Bangor",Class B,2020-11-12T12:00:00Z,44.78159,-68.2283,2020,Maine,67335.0,"Background:  I have spent a large part of my life in the woods between Eddington where I grew up and Deblois where my Grandfather built a hunting / fishing camp in the 1920s – everywhere in between hunting, fishing, camping and hiking.  I have walked those woods since I was 4 years old and I’m now 61 – I know the deer, moose , bear and other wildlife of those woods.  I built my camp on Spectacle Pond in Osborn in 1988.  I have spent a lot of time in the years since exploring the woods and waters around the camp over the years and know the area between Route 179 and Route 193 better than most and within 10 miles of my camp, better than anyone.  Since 2008 when I retired from the U.S. Navy, I have spent one month every year at my camp – 2 weeks in May, fishing and 2 weeks in November, hunting.  I have spent many days and nights in the most remote areas of that part of Maine. On the evening of November 12th  2020, my wife and I had returned to our camp after an afternoon deer hunt, it was dark by the time we got back to camp and settled in for a routine evening with getting the camp warmed up, supper, a couple hands of cribbage and talking – we had been in camp for 10 days.  At around 8:30 my wife decided to go to bed as we planned to hunt the morning.  I picked up my book and was reading until 10:30.  The only light within a half mile of my camp was the single gas light in the front room of the camp which I was using to read – the nearest people were 0.5 mile away in their camp back toward Route 9.  I decided to call it a night at 10:30 and wanted to relieve myself before I went to bed so I went outside across the porch, down the front steps and walked approximately 15 feet to the back outside corner of the camp.  Within seconds of standing in that spot there was two very loud “THWACK” sounds just inside the woodline which is 15 yards across the back yard.  It took me by surprise as I’ve never heard that sound before completely by myself in the woods.  It sounded identical to someone taking a large stick of firewood and hitting a tree in full swing.  I could easily replicate that noise as in knocking snow/ice off firewood against a tree, but with force.  I did not have a flashlight with me as the diffused light from the gas light inside the camp gave me enough point of reference to get back inside so I didn’t think to bring one with me.  I stood there perplexed as to what I had just heard and trying to make sense of it, when it happened again…”THWACK” but this time a little farther away – maybe 25-30 yards, but still quite loud.  This repeated itself 10 or 11 times over a period of maybe 2 to 3 minutes, each time a little more distant than before.  I remained standing there as I was still trying to figure out what it was “THWACKing” these trees.  After the hitting of trees dissipated, I returned to the camp and locked the door – I didn’t (and still don’t) know what it was but I knew it wasn’t a person, moose, deer or bear!  Of note, there was absolutely no light as in a flashlight from a person.  Additionally, those woods are extremely thick with dead spruce and fir – lots of blowdowns yet there was absolutely no noise – no snapping branches, breaking twigs. Nothing – Silence.  I can tell you first hand that nobody could walk down through there in broad daylight, much less at night without a flashlight without snapping branches and making a lot of noise. I spent an additional hour in the camp that night reflecting on what I had heard and trying to attribute it to something that made sense – there was none in all of my experience.  I went to bed and when we got up Friday morning, we decided to hang out at camp to get a start on packing and cleaning as we were closing up camp and leaving on Saturday.  I walked into the woods during daylight where I heard the “THWACK” noises the night before but found nothing where I expected to see some type of sign.  Needless to say, I didn’t tell my wife about those events until Saturday morning as we were getting ready to leave. I still have no idea what it was and it was so dark, I didn’t see anything but I can tell you that I’ve never heard or experienced anything like that in the many years I’ve spent in those woods and the 30+ years I’ve owned that camp."
75382,Report 75382: Fishern reports knocks and trees pushed over on lake 30 miles NW of Lewiston,Class B,2022-08-01T12:00:00Z,44.32852,-70.68238,2022,Maine,75382.0,"During the Spring/Summer of 2022 I discovered a new favorite remote trout pond not far from my camp. This pond is roughly a 1-mile hike to access. Hiking trails are present however in the roughly 20+ times I visited this pond I saw a total of 5 other people. Two pairs of hikers, and one other lone fisherman. This pond is notorious for wind so I would only visit it on calm days. The more I visited the pond the more I noticed odd occurrences. I personally had never heard a tree fall in the woods until I started going here. Just during my visits to this pond, I heard five tree falls. Although it should be noted that I saw none of them. In addition to this I heard an innumerable number of tree knocks during my visits. My visits here started in April and ended in August. The activity grew greater as the summer progressed. I noted how odd the coincidence of the tree falls was but thought nothing of it until one of my final visits. The peak of the activity was during this visit in mid-August where I heard two tree falls. This peaked my attention off fishing and on to what was going on around me. I noticed on this trip that every time I paddled to the north end of the pond, I was met with tree knocks. This continued until I noticed the mid-section of a birch tree leaned up against another tree on the water's edge. I had paddled up and down that pond at least 100 time over the course of the spring/summer and I had only now noticed the birch tree. I felt as though it had to have been placed there while I was on the south side of the pond. As I was examining the tree from my canoe, I again heard tree knocks again. I then paddled back to the south end and fished there until light began to fade and got ready to hike out. Near the pond large rocks block the trail to ensure no ATV cannot drive directly to the pond. On these rocks sat a perfectly intact birch tree skin. I am not convinced a person couldn't have done these things. However, given the proximity of my experiences to another sighting on this website I felt I should report them. I never had any weird occurrences while hiking in, out, or around the pond. Only when I was on the pond fishing."

This is in Hillsdale County in Osseo, Michigan.  I had just crested a small hill when about 200-250 yards in front of me I saw a very large, reddish brown creature on two legs run across the road and into a very thick and wooded area.  This creature literally cleared the road in what appeared to be one huge step.  The sun was shining bright and it's reddish brown hair really stood out.  It appeared to me the thing had been running and maybe slowed down.  As it came out into the opening and saw me it leaped or ran across the road into the heavy thicket.  It was traveling from west to east.  As I approached where it had crossed it had already disappeared into the thick woods and brush.  I didn't look for tracks because I was so taken back by what I had just seen. Up until this time I had never believed in bigfoot or sasquatch.  Whatever I saw that day was no human or any other animal I have ever seen before.  It was very large and probably stood around 7 or 8 feet tall.  It's body mass was proportionate to it's height as well.  I really feel that I saw a sasquatch."

We got out to check out an area, see how the river is, all of a sudden we hear a real heavy sounding animal moving through the thick Tag Alders and brush on the non riverside of the road but right as that goes silent we hear another big creature on the river side, it goes from just making enough noise for us to notice that there is 2 big animals that seemed to be traveling together and it seems like we had interrupted them crossing the road so the one that was like 30 to 40 feet away suddenly does what I can only imagine was a bluff charge through the thick brush just knocking every Tad Alder and branch down with authority. Then after about 20 feet it stops and a few seconds later we both hear a tree getting just ripped down with force. It then like went silent on us, I was trying to see in the thick brush to get a visual but i never did get to see it, but i could hear it trying to hide in the straw grass. I could hear it swaying I believe I threw some rocks to try an illicit a response but there was no rocks it could of thrown back and that pretty much it the river had prevented me from just going in after it. Ross wanted to leave and I didn't swim across and investigate like I should have, its been a big regret. We were supposed to go fishing so we left. It seemed too intelligent to just be a bear and if I had interrupted a bear and cub I would think my aggressive attitude I used for that investigation would have gotten me attacked, had it been bear. It was 40 - 50 feet away tops."

56552,Report 56552: Possible ongoing activity experienced while hiking a trail outside Gladstone,Class B,2016-11-26T12:00:00Z,45.89259,-87.04828,2016,Michigan,56552.0,"November 26th, 2016. A friend and I were taking a walk out at Days River Trail on the outskirts of Gladstone, MI.  in the Upper Peninsula. We arrived around 7 p.m.  My friend didn’t want to be there in the dark but I am an intuitive medium and I have no fear of the dark with the things I deal with. I have been to Days River Trail many times during my lifetime but only within this last year has this place been an interest to me to see what it feels like at night. We decided to walk the outer trail once we cross the bridge over the river. We took a right after the bridge and before we hit the corner we looked up and saw this light, high up to our left, up over a small ridge. It was a bright light, shining but not moving at all. Still. We took our mini flashlights and were trying to see what it was or where it was coming from and then started talking loud and it did not move, not at all. We kept walking, not long after the first corner we heard something walking to our right which is on the river side and it would have been down an embankment. It was definitely on two feet not 4. I grew up in the country and know a lot of what animals sound like.  My friend was worried and asked me what I thought, I didn’t want her to run so I said I think it’s a deer let’s keep moving.  We got farther into the woods and started looping in the inside trails and it was a beautiful night, not too cold and somewhat clear out. We came to a place where there is a bench and a fire pit. We stopped there for about an hour and just talked since we don’t see each other often. Both of us felt like we were being watched but not in a dangerous way. I usually “see” things wherever I go since I am an intuitive/medium. I couldn’t “see” anything this night just had a feeling of being watched. As we left and started walking the trail around the other side of the forest, (we would be eventually coming out to the left after the bridge.) We could smell something that was skunk like but not really. I can’t describe it.  Bad body odor? skunk?. That smell stayed with us for a bit then disappeared. As we got closer to the bridge we were both feeling like it was time to go, it was close to 10 p.m. now and BTW we were the only people out there. Typically no one walks out there alone or in groups at night.  (Just for FYI reasons to there is a meat packing plant across the road from the entrance to this trailway.) We crossed the bridge, and started hearing this “crying” noise that made the hair stand up on the back of my neck. I had never heard anything like this. I am 50. I grew up in the woods. I feel like I know animal noises. This was something different. It kept calling or crying until we got to the beginning of where we started. I felt like whatever/whoever it was didn’t want us to leave.  My friend thought it was a wounded animal. At first I did too but after listening and deciphering I know this was something completely out of my scope of what I know. I started doing research the moment I got home. I am convinced I experienced the all elusive Bigfoot. I found audio from others on Youtube that matched exactly what we heard. I went back a few days later alone during the day around 1 p.m. I decided to go directly to the left after the bridge and made my way to the area about where the  calling or crying would have come from. I stopped at this very large tree and just stood there patiently waiting. Maybe 10 minutes after I got there, I heard it again, this time it seemed farther away and less of a crying and more of a whistling , to me it felt like whatever this is was just letting me know it knew I was back. I didn’t stay long because in my intuitive vision I saw a cougar/mountain lion and know that they have been seen out here before and caught on camera. So, I thanked whatever was out there for letting me “hear” it again and went on my way to document this experience."

Our house borders the Huron National Forest the figure was half way down a hill looking in our direction it moved very quickly in a half moon circle and crouched down near a tree. We walked toward the figure I noticed it was still near the tree bent over slightly almost like it was trying not to be noticed. We both ran back to the garage and talked about what we saw and decided we didn't know what it was mostly because of its size and the way it moved. When we got back to the garage we both said how hard our hearts were beating it was truly a scary experience. My daughters name is Madison we talked about it for a long time that night and tried to come up with an animal it could have been but could not. The next day I called my friend Jeff he has experience in this field we walked the area and seen a lot of deer activity and droppings it was thriving with wildlife.

My driveway is fairly long over 100 yards and wooded on both sides and makes a slight turn. I had a flashlight with me as performed my task. When I was returning my light was trained on the ground before me watching were I was walking. I looked up and saw something moving away from the entrance to my garage (my main door was open). I could see in the lights from inside my garage that it was at least as tall as I (6'+) and was a brownish color. I shined my light at it. It moved purposefully but not hurried, quickly but not in fear. It was upright but I don't recall seeing legs, although my light was at the upper portion of it. As it moved it almost glided (without the usual bobbing a person would make) and it was silent as it moved. I didn't notice any facial or distinguishing features. As it went behind my camper I stopped in my tracks for a moment to determine what it was I actually saw. I believed I caught a trespasser trying to rob me. I rounded the corner of the camper and shined the light at the edge of the treeline of my roundabout, and it was there again, the same form, but it moved into the treeline almost looking as it faded into them, no sound not a twig snapping. I never saw any eyes or face. I ran in to grab my rifle and told my girlfriend to lock the door behind me as I went out to where it disappeared. The area was full of dead fall trees and other brush. I tried to traverse it but had extreme difficulty in doing so, let alone without any sound. My neighboring property is a hunting cabin.  A hunting party had just returned from dinner and saw me with a flashlight and rifle clamoring through the woods to their property. Fortunately open mindedness and cool heads were abound. I explained what had happened, my neighbor stated it could have been a Black Bear walking on his hind legs looking for the garbage. It seemed plausible (I know there are bears around my house) but that explanation never did sit right. With no tracks, the form taller than a bear even on hind legs would be. I didn't see a snout and it wasn't barrel shaped more thin and human like, gliding instead of the typical wobble a walking bear does, and the total absence of sound when entering the woods. I was more convinced it was a ghost more than bear."
59590,Report 59590: Possible vocalization outside Rock MI near western edge of Hiawatha National Forest,Class B,2018-05-30T12:00:00Z,46.06728,-87.15701,2018,Michigan,59590.0,"We,(FIVE OF US) planned a three day investigation on private property, some 126 acres of private property near Rock, north of Escanaba Michigan, U.P. Arriving in a predetermined site, some half mile into the described property near the Hiawatha National Forest, the working campsite was set up in a clearing, surrounded by forest and swamp land. Drone footage revealed our location to be in a remote area with opened swamp land, wooded habitation for local wildlife and full of game trails. Large cats, coyote, black bear, wolves and deer comprise the common larger wild-life in this area. Several digital cameras were set up or used during our visit to this area including GoPro, Panasonic video cam, HD drone cam, digital photo cams, trail cam, digital audio recorder and IR night vision cam and a digital SD card megaphone loaded with various sasquatch vocalizations gathered before the trip. The first night, Wednesday the 30th of May, 2018 was mainly uneventful, though I went to use a tree earlier in the day behind our campsite and happened to look down to my right and smack in the middle of a game trail were two large footprints. The prints looked older with some leaves and debris in them. Frank and Bart made a cast. During this first evening, Frank and Bart heard some physical movement in the wooded area directly behind the camp, Frank searched the tree line along the edge of the site and believes that he observed ""something"", through the IR camera, though it was not captured due to a ""battery issue"". We all entered our tents sometime after 1:30am or so. The second night, Thursday, May 31st, was a completely different experience. I still do not understand why a group of ""first timers"" with no personal Squatch research experience, schooled only by what we read about the subject and view on You Tube, would have such an incredible event happen to us. I will say few words about this experience, my partners will share their own perception of what took place. We all entered our tents some time after 2am on the second night. Ignorance and inexperience account for me not turning on the digital audio recorder before turning in. After all, we were going to sleep, nothing had happened earlier, and thinking of the next day's possibilities, I completely let everyone down, but learned a lesson. consequently, we did not capture the audio of something huge that came near us within 50+ yards or so of our camp. ""CLOSE, LOUD AND LONG""!!! A little after 4am, (we check our watches), a long and loud yell or howl, lasting at least a good 10 seconds, pierced the night, immediately followed by a pack of coyote, yelping, inter-mingled with shorter yells/howls from whatever was ""shaking"" up the forest, woke us all up in complete surprise and amazement. The length of the vocalization exceed the capability of a wolf by 5+ seconds or so. The yell was definitely not a wolf. It did not seem like this could really happen, BUT IT DID!  Once the coyote stopped their yelping, EVERYTHING went silent! no critters to be heard for sometime after. - DB Bart's testimony: MONDAY  night,  arrived set up camp, soot steps behind me, felt like something behind me, Frank looked behind me with night vision he was a bit shaken and said he saw a face. looked again with new batteries and face was gone. TUESDAY NIGHT; large scream 75 yards to south coyotes went crazy with 2 short screams. nothing I ever heard, lasted about 10 to 12 seconds om first long scream/howl,,,,,,, WEDNESDAY : am, discussed what happened in am at 4:20 determined it was bigfoot and length, distance and intensity of the owl/scream......in pm met with bigfoot expert and had lot of answers to questions...... THURSDAY;  woke up and someone noticed bones about 30 feet away. they were over a foot long looked like bones from a deer and were snapped clean and looked bleached from sun. this bothered me. someone had to of seen this sooner. all words are from journal and not to be changed or polished............. Bart Frank's testimony: Shortly after arriving at our camp site Dennis found a foot print. It was the left foot. I was able to put my fingers into the indentation of the toes. It seemed the fourth toe was missing. We also saw a light impression of another and possibly a third print not far away.  First night we were there We were sitting around the fire and Bart said there was something to his left and behind him I slowly got up and looked through the night vision camera and thought I saw a face between two small trees then the camera died. When the camera was working again I could not find it again. This was possibly 20 foot from me. I found no foot prints in that area the next day. We later went to sleep. Bart and I got out of the tent about 4:20 to go pee. We heard what sounded like a whistle it was a tone like a bird we heard earlier but sounded different. We could hear no other sound , birds or frogs.  The second night we were awaken by what I can only describe as a yell that was so loud sounding like whooooo about 10sec long with coyote yelling at the same time in the same location there were 4 or 5 short yells 2 or 3 sec that quickly followed then total silence. This sound was perhaps only 50-75 yards away That was the only time we heard coyotes at our camp before or after. We found 2 bones maybe 40 or 50 feet from our tents there were no other bones to be found so the kill was not there. In the picture you can see how one bone was broken. Frank"

So I scope in on it and I realize whatever it was, was hiding behind a tree looking around it. So my buddy’s start scoping in on it to. Then it proceeded to crouch down low to the ground and look around the other side of the tree.

It was black and at the distance I couldn't make out what it was. The closer I got I assumed it was a bear. But then it stood up and very quickly ran into the ditch and stood in the brush and looked at me. I couldn't believe what I had just saw. Long arms long legs, dark black and about 7-8 ft. tall. It was big and fast. I looked at it and I got the impression it was nervous the way it was acting ... Being a mile from my truck and having 2 of them to the front and back of me and the nervousness I was feeling I decided it was best to head off it was a long walk out."

I was walking alone through the Lost Forty scientific natural area near Dora Lake MN on this past Wednesday the 3rd of June 2015. Around 12 o'clock noon. Just last week as I was taking pictures of the 350 year old white pines with my camera phone. My Dad was back in the car and he honked the horn and yelled at me to come back as he was getting impatient as always. I immediately heard strange unexplainable sounds after he honked the horn. I believe he startled whatever it was back there because the sounds were getting louder after he honked the horn. I was deep in the forest and you could hear a pin drop. The sounds I heard were absolutely unexplainable for me to write down. It sounded like there must be a 500 pound woodpecker back here banging into some trees. I didn't think anything of it because nothing really scares me. I carried on, taking many beautiful pictures of the untouched white pines deep into the Lost Forty scientific and natural area. 15 minutes after my hike,I heard a tree starting to loudly crack and fall within 20 maybe 30 feet from where I was standing still. Startled, I looked all around 360 degrees to make sure it didn't fall on top of me. Just less than 20 to 30 feet away this GIANT birch tree flung back up into the air in its original upright position. The path was curved so I couldn't see around the next corner on the ground. I had less than 5 seconds as my mind was running through all the possibilities of what just happened. I have never been so afraid in my entire life and nothing ever really scares me. I thought it may be a bear at first but that tree was so big I almost ruled it out right away. I immediately ran for my life in the opposite direction as fast as humanly possible about a quarter mile back to the car. I was afraid whatever it was had been chasing me. It wasn't thank God, because halfway to the car I had to stop and catch my breath for about a minute. It seemed like I ran forever and I thought this was the end of me. As I was running back to the car my Dad heard me running through the forest huffing and puffing, and he thought I was just messing with him. He told me that ""I looked like I had just seen a ghost and, what the hell just happened?"". I drove away from that place going about 80 miles an hour. Couldn't barely breath for a half hour. I have never heard or seen or experienced anything like this in my whole life. I did not personally see it, but it saw me and must have climbed up a large birch tree causing it to bend down and crack as the creature fell to the ground. As I described the event to other people and some locals throughout the week, some said it was not a bear. They told me to watch your show on tv. I am watching your TV show for the first time now while I'm typing this. I have never seen your show before today. And as I see those people in your Base camp episode. I'm realizing I was only a half hour drive away from most of those incidents. We have a summer home in Blackduck MN. I was up there for my annual fishing trip, I live in Rockford IL. So I am very far away from where it happened right now. If you are looking for a sasquatch I suggest you head to the Lost Forty scientific natural area (SNA) in Northern Minnesota. I'm never going back there alone. Maybe for the right reasons if there were people with firearms with me. And I hope you guys please contact me by phone right away.This was only a few days ago so every detail is fresh in my mind still."

At about 330 this morning I heard three, deep, loud, one toned type of noise and then I heard what sounded like a tree knock.

46676,Report 46676: Soldier reports possible vocalizations during a morning group run at Fort Leonard Wood,Class B,2014-10-01T12:00:00Z,37.4504,-92.5415,2014,Missouri,46676.0,"I am a Soldier stationed at Fort Leonardwood, MO.  Every morning we do physical exercises such as running.  That morning we did a 3.8 mile run on the ""Engineer Trail"".  The Engineer trail is a giant 3.8 mile track that has about 10 acres of land in the middle of the circle for land navigation exercises, and towards the back of the track opens up into a giant forest that feeds into Misty Mountain and the outer section of the post.  That land behind the track is 100+ acres I'd say.  On the morning of 1 October, 2014 around 0600- 0615, we (about 15 Soldiers) started our run individually, so we were spread out being some were faster than others.  About midway through the track, we came across a barrier.  A tree about 3-4 feet in diameter that looked to be healthy, not rotten, and relatively in good shape was laid across the track.  We haven't had any crazy wind storms that could've knocked it over, but at any rate myself and other soldiers didn't think anything of it.  As i continued on my run, I encountered another tree that was knocked over but it looked as if someone, maybe some soldiers, had drug it off the road.  Same diameter as the other one, but almost as if someone didn't want us on the track.  I continued on my run and about a mile and half I reached the the back side of the track where it meets the woods that go towards the eastern side of the border of post.  That's when I started hearing a yell that kind of sounded like ""whoops"".  It must've been around 200 feet away.  I immediately stopped running and started listening.  That's when I heard around 5 different ""whoops"".  I say around 5 because each time I heard it, I had to change the position of my head each time I heard one.  3 were from inside the circle of the track, and about 2-4 were on the border of track on the backside.  Being that I was out there alone, (I was in the lead of the pack of Soldiers) I didn't want to encounter what I was hearing I started running to get away from the back side of the track and back towards the civilization side with a quickness.  I know what I heard immediately being that I google, youtube, and watch a lot of documentaries on bigfoot.  The thing was when I got back to the start point, I didn't want to mention what I had heard in fear I might be made fun of or something.  So when the rest of the group caught up and finished.  They immediately started talking about the sounds.  A few of them even mentioned ""bigfoot calls"", with a seriousness.  Most people when they talk about bigfoot, you always get the guys who are sarcastic and snobby.  Well this group of Soldiers we all agreed, there was a family of them out there talking to each other out there on the track. On top of that, I have encountered this odor before when me and my wife will go ride trails on the 4 wheeler, a musky odor.  The entire run, all I could describe the odor as is like a musky/ sewage smell the entire route.  We have ran that route several times, and normally all you smell are the trees and weeds around.  This time it was completely odorless almost to a gagging kind of way.  I wouldn't think twice about saying me and the soldiers I ran with that day encountered a family of sasquatches."

I parked my truck by the picnic table. I turned off my truck and got out looking at the stars. It was just a moment and I noticed a whooping call it sounded like a monkey at the zoo. I listened for a good 20 minutes the call was the same a whoop whoop then a pause for a short time then another whoop whoop. It sounded like it was coming from the heavily wooded valley below me.

It scared me so bad I immediately grabbed my things and high tailed it out of there. I am an avid outdoorsman and night fisherman. I know the sounds around lakes, ponds, and woods at night.

My family and I as well as our neighbors have heard wood knocks come from that area. My son and I were both spooked by a very loud roar like noise one evening, and one night seen a large creature moving through the field. March 2017 Update: My wife and I had just put our boys to bed and returned to the living room to watch TV about 10 minutes later our dog started barking in an aggressive manner on porch which got my attention as well as my boys who got out of bed . I invited our dog inside house and took my spot light out and I came across a large set of orange glowing eyes at least 8 foot off the ground. I motioned for my wife to come out to look at it my oldest boy came out with her. We watched for at least 2 minutes or a little longer as it would look from behind the oak it was trying to hide behind. I began yelling at it saying things like we see you then it ran catching it's full side view. Nothing else unusual however my wife boy and myself were very startled at the size and speed of it as it ran away. We commented to one another about the size of it's arms very massive.

57305,Report 57305: Man living off grid hears strange occurrences including knocks and whoops at Goose Creek Lake,Class B,2017-04-13T12:00:00Z,37.5965,-90.4935,2017,Missouri,57305.0,"Hello I live off grid inside Goose Creek Lake north of Farmington, MO. Its actually French Village, MO. but inside Goose Creek Lake community. And I am on the north side of Goose Creek Lake, Stone Horse Lane. Last night 04/13/2017 I had just turned off my generator for a peaceful night of nature while I sleep. As I laid in bed I noticed that all the crickets, birds, frogs all stopped sounding or making noise. After about 20 or so minutes I heard what sounded like tree knocks but it was just one knock and I did not hear a reply. The direction in which I heard this sound was right next door on another lot beside mine. I thought to myself was that just what I thought it was a tree knock. I became frightened and I could hear my neighbors shed creak like something big pushed against it. I heard this for several minutes then it went silent again and still no sounds of any birds, crickets etc. The only reason I know it was a tree knock is because I've studied bigfoot since I was a kid, watching stories etc. Then I started hearing russling sounds coming from next door on same side I heard the knock come from. I could hear something pressing against the gravel driveway they have over there. At one time I thought I heard a growl and chewing sounds. After a terrifying hour or so I could hear what ever it was walking but it did not sound like a person, a animal walking. After a few minutes I heard a whooping sound but I did not hear a reply to it. I would appreciate it if someone can call me maybe come out here because today I went looking for signs of what it could have been and found a foot print in the gravel road just feet from where I heard all the noise the night before. I also took it upon myself and took pictures of the print with a tape measure. I then called security about the matter and they came out and I showed Randy the foot print. It measured 17"" by 6"" I am concerned that I may be in danger."
58937,Report 58937: Homeowners find fresh snow tracks of a possible adult and juvenile north of Forsyth,Class B,2018-02-12T12:00:00Z,36.72415,-93.11722,2018,Missouri,58937.0,"Dual track line - MANY photos taken and measured - immediately after heavy 6"" snowfall on the night of Monday 15 Jan 2018. The night of Monday 15 Jan 2018, was dark - the night of the new (dark) moon. The overnight low temperature was -1° F, and the wind chill was -7° F, and there were six (6) inches of snow on the ground. At around midnight… we heard a “THUMP” outside our bedroom window. Just beneath our window is a large plastic storage box for BBQ charcoal. The BBQ grill (covered with a winter tarp) is approximately 8 feet from the storage box, with an area between for use by summer grill masters. The “THUMP” was the sound of something striking the side of that large plastic storage box - a sound we’d heard numerous times in the past when working around the box and accidentally bumping or kicking it. Despite the sound being a very familiar one, and one which we instantly recognized, it was “out of place” for the middle of the night and both Sharon and I awoke instantly. I said aloud “DID YOU HEAR THAT?” Sharon answered “YES I DID!” I felt the bed tremble several times very slightly… similar to when a heavy truck drives by on the road out front… and I said aloud “I HEAR FOOTSTEPS!” At that point I considered grabbing my handgun to deal with a potential intruder, but the sounds and the vibrations were not repeated. We listened for a few more minutes then went back to sleep. The next day, Tuesday 16 Jan 2018, the temperature never climbed over 12° F, with light winds, but a wind chill that remained at-or-below 0° F. We stayed inside nearly all day, only venturing out on the east side of the house briefly to check temperatures in our out-buildings. Mid-afternoon Sharon asked me if I’d been outside in the yard. I told her that I had not gone out at all except to check the well house earlier. She stood at the bedroom window and pointed to a line of large, widely spaced footprints outside… and said that it appeared that we HAD been visited by an “intruder” during the night. We went out to find TWO lines of tracks coming toward the house from the west, then curving south alongside the house just outside the bedroom window. One of the line of tracks was footprints that were 13”-14” long, 5” wide at the heel, and 7” wide at the toe. Some of those tracks clearly showed individual toe prints. All were smooth, with no pattern or marking and no break between heel and the remainder of the foot (as would be found with a boot or shoe). One of the line of tracks appeared to be smaller footsteps - presumable a juvenile - with clear toe prints showing in some of the footprints. At times the juvenile tracks showed dragging toes side-by-side as if the walker was partially lifted upward so that both feet dragged marks in the snow, side-by-side, before resuming walking. At other points the smaller juvenile prints appeared to indicate that the walker had hopped repeatedly two or three times on one foot, then “jumped” or been lifted, dragging both feet for a distance of some 8 feet, and then planting one foot and resuming stride, or hopping onto the other foot. We believe that one of those hops or jumps resulted in the juvenile bumping the storage box which woke us inside the bedroom, and prompted out vocal comments. Those comments would have been very clearly audible just outside the window. Beside the plastic storage box located beneath our bedroom window the two lines of tracks became a single track (apparently the juvenile was lifted by the larger adult). The stride length of the larger prints averaged 5 1/2 feet as the tracks approached the house. Both lines curved, turning south close beside the house (this is the point at which the juvenile prints appear to show lifting, dragging both feet, and hopping). At the point where the two lines of tracks changed to a single line of large (adult) footprints - presumably due to the adult having heard our vocal comments inside the bedroom, and reacted by lifting/carrying the juvenile. At that point the stride length of the larger prints grew to 6 feet in length, at some points nearing 7 feet apart. There is no indication of running at any point in the larger print tracks, either before or after the closest approach to the bedroom window and the plastic storage box. There were no toe scuffing or heel scuffing as are made by a human attempting to run in the snow. There were “brush” marks behind several of the large (adult) footprints. Close examination of those mark revealed they looked like they were made with a whisk broom with a very light touch. Individual traces could be seen clearly… and it is presumed that the marks were made by dragging hairs that hung from the legs of the creature that made the tracks. The line of large prints made a line heading directly for the roadway - obviously quickly moving away from the house and our voices inside the bedroom. The tracks crossed the road (and were later obliterated in the roadway by multiple visits from the snowplow on Tuesday), continuing at an angle across the yard on the other side. Approximately 100 feet into that other yard, the stride length of the large print tracks slightly reduced, and the smaller (juvenile) prints reappeared. We presume that that larger creature (adult) put the smaller (juvenile) back on the ground. The two lines of tracks continued in a straight line another 300 feet toward a dense treeline. I contacted RON BOLES with the Bigfoot Field Research Organization (BFRO) who had been involved in investigating the traces of activities we have had on our property for many years. While he was unable to visit in person, he arranged for another BFRO Investigator to stop by on the morning of Wednesday at 8am to photograph the prints. Sadly many of the prints in our yard were slightly degraded by wind-blown snow dropping from overhanging trees that eroded the sharper edges of the prints. The track of prints in the neighbor’s yard across the road was not degraded due to an absence of overhanging trees to shed snow. Temperatures later on the day Wednesday, then on Thursday, melted enough snow to remove all but a single handful of prints in the deepest snow in the neighbor’s yard. Those prints, however, were degraded by tracks from stray dogs which appeared to find extreme interest in the line of strange tracks. By Friday virtually all snow had melted and no evidence of the tracks remained."

I know it wasnt a bear. Having said that I don't know what to think. I am attaching a google doc that has pictures of what we found... So this last Saturday at about 12:30 my hunting partner and I went to Smittle cave conservation area to scout and see what conservation has cleared. We crossed a creek bottom to where there are small food plots. Once we crossed to the other side of the field we saw something on the trail about 150 to 200 yards off. even from that distance I could see it was big. I noted a head by a limb that I judged was maybe 5 or six feet of the ground. what we saw then crouched and sort of swayed a few times before taking off to the right and stopping. not being sure what we saw we crossed into the next field and discussed what it was, we turned around and went back to the field we had seen the creature and it was gone. We crossed back to where it had been and found a large fresh footprint. I put my foot down next to the print. I wear a size 10 1/2 and the print is way bigger than my foot. We estimate it to be 16 or 18 inches long.  In that same area we found broken trees that had been pulled up and then wove between other trees. What does that? Also the limb we thought was maybe five or six feet off the ground was more like 8 foot maybe 9. What we saw was big and when it moved it almost glided. It was dark gray with brown hair, it was bipedal. I couldn't make out facial features or say 100 percent what it was. We were too far away."
65870,Report 65870: Possible daylight sighting near Missouri River and Katy Trail outside Hartsburg,Class B,2020-05-14T12:00:00Z,38.4125,-92.1855,2020,Missouri,65870.0,"Thursday, May 14th 2020. 10:30 am. South of Hartsburg MO. About 1500 hundred ft south of town on South Bush Landing Road. Hartsburg is a small community of around 100 people. The area is on the bottoms of the Missouri River. A bike trail called ""Katy Trail"" runs North and South through Hartsburg. My wife was taking care of her 93 year old mother and I decided to drive down to the river and look around. There were a lot of people riding bikes on the trail because of the pandemic going strong and no one could work or shop. It was a sunny warm day. I was driving south slowly when I looked up ahead on the road and I saw a big figure moving across the road in a very fast pace. Not running but, walking in big fast strides. It looked like vert big person, tall, thick, and brown in color all over. I thought it was weird for a guy to be walking across a farmers field coming east from the river and heading in a straight line to the bluffs. Farmers will ride their ATVs when they are in the fields checking on things. I thought it was wearing a heavy brown coat with a cone shaped hood. There was fresh planted soy in the fields and I could see this thing from head to foot. When I first saw it I was about a 100 yards away. I was driving slowly. By the time I reached where he crossed the road he had covered at least 200 yards and walking away from me. I had no camera or binoculars with me that day. I turned down a farmers dirt track road to head toward the thing. When I merged on the road and drove toward it, it turned North and headed toward Katy Trail. I never got any closer to him than the 100 yards and that was because it was moving very fast, swinging its arms. I drove on back to my folks house after that. "
66063,Report 66063: Fisherman describes large animal sounds in James Reed Memorial Wildlife Area,Class B,2020-08-08T12:00:00Z,38.521,-94.188,2020,Missouri,66063.0,"Several times a week I go fishing at the James Reed Memorial Wildlife Area just south of Lee's Summit, MO. It's about 900 acres plus 10 lakes to choose from for fishing and a area with walking trails. Each lake has a level, mowed area about 20 feet wide all the way round it. It is wooded and brushy between lakes plus there are also open meadow/fields scattered around. Animal life is deer (lots of them), fox, possums, rabbit, racoon, squirrel, turkey, geese, golden eagles, cranes, vultures and many smaller birds. During the week there aren't many people there fishing so sometimes I'm the only one. I prefer fishing at the lake that is farthest from the main entrance. I think Google Maps shows it as #9 but it has a name. The first week of August, 2020, I was there fishing for bass and had worked my way half way around the lake when I came upon a very large pile of scat in the mowed walking area. It was well formed and shaped like human feces.  I estimated its size as 16 X 14 inches and about 5 inches high. My first thought was an obese person had somehow managed to completely empty their guts. There are horse riders allowed in the area but I've never once seen their hoofprints around the lake in that area not any horse scat.  The pile did not resemble in any way what a horse does. The last week of August, 2020, I was the only person there and there were no other cars in the parking lot.  I was near where I'd seen the scat.  When I fish I move slowly and quietly. I was on the southwest side of the lake when I heard what I thought was a hoot owl. It hooted three times with no space between hoots. I've never hear an owl do that. I walked and fished for another 100 feet or so and was facing the water when in the trees/brush behind me I heard a deep HumphGrrrr sound. Both sounds were ran together and I could feel it vibrate in my chest. I immediately turned completely around thinking that there was a huge dog nearby and I wanted to make sure it wasn't sneaking up on me. The sound lasted about 3 seconds and even after I couldn't hear it I still felt it vibrate in my chest for a few more seconds. I looked as far back into the trees/brush as I could and saw nothing. I wasn't scared but I felt that I needed to leave so I left and went home. I was there fishing on Sept 8 or 9, 2020 (can't remember which day this happened). Same lake, same time, about 11 AM. I was on the northwest side of the lake casting for bass and I was the only one there. Earlier there was a young man fishing but he left about 10 AM. Except for the occasional bird and locust it was quiet. Suddenly in the brush behind me I heard what I can only describe as a small chimp making sounds like Cheetah the Chimp. I would guess the source of it to be closer than 50 feet. I heard it for perhaps a second or two then it stopped suddenly like someone had flipped a switch. I turned completely around and looked as far back into the trees/brush as I could. I even looked up into the trees on both sides of me and saw nothing. I moved a little faster and quickly worked my way around the lake to the parking lot then went home. That was as weird as the owl and growl I'd heard. This place is about one half mile outside of a city which is a suburb of Kansas City, MO. I do not have any mental illness, I do not drink, do drugs or smoke. I am a retired University teacher. Do you or anyone else have a possible explanation of what I saw and heard? I am really curious and want to know.  Now when I go fishing there I'm looking into the brush around me and up into the trees as I walk."

It was 3:30A.M. I drive an hour to work and get there by 5 so that’s why I was up so early. All was quite and peaceful. Heard a owl off in a tree line. Then about 5 minutes later I heard off in the distance something I had never heard before. I hear coyotes all the time. I’ve heard a bobcat screaming before, but this was far different. It sounded like it was quite always off whatever it was, but sounded very big and deep. The only way I can think to explain the noise was like a big burley man yelling AWWWWWWWW for about 5-10 seconds long. Then nothing else. It caused a neighbor dog down the road to start barking but didn’t seem to phase my dogs. The direction that the noise came from is about 2-3 miles of a combination of timber and farm land, then becomes a big river bottoms and the grand river. I don’t think whatever made the noise was 2-3 miles away, maybe a mile. I have never heard anything like that before in my life and I’ve been a outdoors guy my whole life. I’ve watched different Bigfoot shows hear vocalizations on them and that’s the closest thing I can think of that this sounded like. However I feel like recorded things on TV doesn’t give you the same feel of the power this thing seemed to have, it sent chills down my spine. If it would of been closer I definitely would of gone inside for a gun."

I had been fishing for a couple hours. I was the only one there. The sun had gone down and it was starting to get dark. It was right around 8:30. I witnessed a large rock come from the tree line on the opposite bank and land in the water. It made a big splash. The rock itself was quite large and flew through the air every bit of 20 feet from the point where I first saw it. I am 6’3 350 lbs. a strong guy. But I could not throw a rock that large anywhere near that far. I never saw whatever or whoever threw it. All I know is that something caused that rock to fly through the air. I instantly was confused and fascinated. I stood there for a minute thinking I would be able to see something move in the trees. I didn’t and thought it was a good idea to leave.

Dogs don’t want anything to do with it. There has been two different sounds they make. All we want is answers. They sound like wolves but different. I don’t go hunting before daylight and I come in before dark. When we tell people they just laugh and call us crazy until they hear it."
50297,Report 50297: Horse boarder hears possible vocalizations late at night west of Belgrade,Class B,2015-11-26T12:00:00Z,45.7922,-111.3637,2015,Montana,50297.0,"I used to own a horse boarding facility which was/is located about 3/4 of mile south of the West Gallatin River and about 4 miles north of Belgrade, Montana on the south side of I-90.  One night at around 11 pm I was outside just before going to bed and I heard what I thought was a very loud screams from a woman west of me toward the river.  I was ready to get in my truck and investigate the screaming but the screams were not human.  All of the horses in my boarding pens were snorting and looking west toward the river.  My Australian shepherd dog was also acting very strange; growling and his hair was standing up.  A large number of whitetail deer lived along the river and routinely came down to my place to feed on any hay left over on the ground.  They were a real nuisance. I did not see or hear anything else but I will never forget that sound and the way the horses were acting; similar to smelling a bear.  Even the next morning, Butch, my dog was continually looking toward the river and acting very wary."

Forest (Rattlesnake Wilderness) for the past few weeks. During the past several nights we have been having encounters with some sort of animal which we first thought was a bear. However, durring the daylight hours we have been finding many young trees literally being broken which we have numerous pictures of. We are camping in an area which is 9 miles up a dirt road near the Sheep Mountain trailhead. Several of the broken trees that we have been finding are very close to our campsite while others are up and down the road. There has not been any strong winds in this area for well over a week but yet these trees are broken several feet up from the ground which as anyone well knows, is not normal. We keep hearing something large and heavy walking through the brush and rocks have been thrown at one of our tents. We are all very much in the belief that we are being visited by a sasquach."

We camped by the first creek bottom on the North section of Dutchmans Trail.  We turned into our hammocks about 7:30pm and soon everything started.  I heard a lot of moving about on the other side of a nearly dry creek bed around 8:00 pm.  The movement was a large animal by the sound of the larger branches breaking.  The animal came across the creek near a spot we had been using as our latrine.  I turned on my headlamp and yelled out ""go on"" thinking bear or something.  The movement stopped but then started closer to the camp so I yelled out again.  Then I got a bit scared when two rocks were smashed together ""bang, bang (pause) then bang bang"" again. This freaked me out a bit so I yelled again.  Then above me on the hillside I heard something being thrown through the woods and landing further down the small valley we were in.  Then the day birds started chirping in an arc across the hill side.  Not long after an owl started hooting quite far away.  Dogs started barking all over the forest and the owl stopped.  Then I heard a wail deeper in the woods and it seemed like after the wail the woods went back to normal.  I have spent a lot of time in the woods but this chain of events that went on from 8:00pm to around 12:00 am has unnerved me a bit.  I knew of these creatures but half believed in them but I have had an experience that has changed how I feel in the woods at night."
49148,Report 49148: Appalachian Trail Hikers find possible tracks and hear a late night howl near Franklin,Class B,2015-06-29T12:00:00Z,30.0326,-83.52959,2015,Florida,49148.0,"Shortly after laying down for the night during a backpacking trip in the Nantahala Wilderness, we heard a howl that lasted 10-15 seconds, with a change of tone for the last few seconds. This howl could not have been mistaken for any other animal and sounded very similar to recordings of other howls. In the next 2 hours we both heard random whoops also.  The next day while hiking we came across several very interesting signs along the trail. The first was spotting what looked like a game trail that crossed the hiking trail. Upon closer inspection, the tracks in the well traveled trail clearly were not made by bear or any other four legged animal.  The footprints on the trail had left deep impressions where the heel contacted the ground and footprints much larger than my foot were also seen.  The distance between the tracks was approximately 5 feet on average and the depth of the tracks where the heel had sunk down was 3 plus inches.   The ferns and weeds in the trail that had been pressed down were still green and flat which made me think the tracks had been made within the past couple of days. I followed the trail in both directions for approximately 150 yards and the footprints remained consistent in both directions.  After traveling the hiking trail further down the ridgeline for close to mile I spotted another trail that crossed the hiking trail. The footprints here were identical to what we saw at the first trail. I took pictures to gauge the depth and length of the prints.  I found a stick on this trail that had blood on it.  I regret not keeping it for evidence to see what type of blood it was.  The location of both trails had some similarities: both were located in gaps along the ridgeline and there was an unusually high amount of limbs and trees wedged in tree forks at both sites.  One other strange observation made along the trail was finding 3 large white mushrooms placed upside down near the trails. One of these was on a rock and another was found on the trail while following the footprints.  The area where we found these signs was the direction where we had heard the howl the night before."

I was at the trailhead of Dutchmans Creek at 9 in the morning during a week day about two weeks ago. Mine was the only car at the trailhead until after 10:30 with only logging trucks passing through every 30-45 minutes. I was walking down Dutchmans Creek, enjoying the solitude and quiet of the forest when I turned a bend and heard a loud wood knock at my two o'clock and was answered by another at my 10  o'clock within one second of the first. It threw me off because it sounded like an answering reply. I walked back up the trail and hung out for about thirty minutes just listening relaxing before I choose to head back down the trail. As i approached the same bend in the trail I again heard a wood knock at my 10 o'clock and then a second at my 5 o'clock. Extremely weird I thought, and again within one second of each other. I decided to walk back up the trail towards the second knock. There's an atv trail near the trailhead I walked up until I heard another wood knock around the same area I would have estimated the second at my 5 o'clock would have been. I waited for about fifteen minutes without hearing or seeing anything else. I decided to walk back to the base of the trail head and within twenty foot steps back down the trail I heard something huff at me from over my left shoulder. It came from inside a deep ditch but I didn't see anything there. I've had deer huff at me before when I've gotten close and they spotted me, I'm sure bear huff as well to threaten/challenge something but what got me was that I heard and saw no movement at all throughout this entire time. I walked back to the trailhead, waited 15-20 min and then snook back towards the same spot. I was completely quiet; no rustling from my clothes, boots didn't rustle plants and no crunch from dried leaves or twigs. As I approached I heard what sounded like a guttural baby moan or call. This occurred in high brush on the other side of the ditch to my right. The sound occurred every hand full of minutes and I would creep closer to see if I could spot it. Though the sound would change the direction it was facing there was never any movement in the brush and though I always carry when I'm in the woods I dared not enter into the thick brush, especially since I couldn't identify the animal that had huffed at me nor what type of animal was making the cries from in the brush. I didn't feel spooked until after the event when I thought over what had happened. I enjoy the woods, tracking and following game trails and though most of my experience is in Florida swamps with hogs or deer I couldn't identify the guttural moaning or see the thing that huffed at me."
50074,Report 50074: Possible encounter scares a camper from his hammock while in the Uwharrie National Forest,Class B,2015-10-25T12:00:00Z,35.46955,-80.08778,2015,North Carolina,50074.0,"To begin, I am 34 years old, I have a degree in Biology, and I have spent my entire life in the woods mostly by myself and have grown accustomed to the noises animals and the forest itself makes. I go backpacking and backcountry camping year round. I am not an expert but I have experience in the woods. My wife, two dogs, and I were camping in Uwharrie National on October 23 -25. Friday night we heard a lot of noises ranging from coyotes far away to leaves rustling just outside our site. I just purchased a hammock and wanted to try it out in the woods. So Saturday I set up my hammock 20-30 feet into the woods just outside our site. Our site is on the side and near the entrance of the campground and the most secluded with the woods to its back; this is why we choose it. So I go to bed in the hammock Saturday night facing the campground and the woods behind me, and all is well until 2:30am, I wake up to branches breaking behind my head. The branches sounded like they could have been as close as 30 feet to as far away as 50 feet to my right. Imagine if my head is 12 o’clock and my feet are 6 o’clock, these branches were being broken at 11-12 o’clock or over my right shoulder. At first I thought it was a deer or a bear passing by but I know what they sound like as they walk (a couple months ago I was face to face with a mother bear and her cubs), but I never actually heard distinct footsteps and as the breaking didn’t move in location I became a little freaked out. I’m lying in the hammock trying to explain what is going on and nothing is making sense. I never made a noise to scare it away and didn’t shine my headlamp. Then I hear a noise that is hard to explain come from about 1 o’clock or over my left shoulder. I can only describe this as similar to the noise a deer makes when it’s alerting other deer to danger, but if a deer were to make this noise it would have to be 20 feet tall. It was deeper than any noise I’ve ever heard come from the forest. Deeper than a lion’s roar and as long as a human’s sigh. The branch breaking continued for about 15 minutes until I start hearing the alternating branch break and what sounded like a large bird flapping its wings one time. I heard ‘snap whoosh, snap whoosh, snap whoosh’. About this time, I hear my wife coughing and before we went to bed she said that her stomach was feeling a little upset, I thought maybe she is sick. I muster up the courage to get out of the hammock hoping that in doing so I will also scare away the animal. I go up to her and she’s fine, now I have a dilemma, I don’t want to go back but I can’t stay in the tent because my sleeping bag is in the woods. So I go back and I pick up a branch, snap it and throw it in to the woods three times. Then I urinate all around my hammock. While I was doing this the branch breaking had ceased. I get in the hammock and seconds after turning off my headlamp the breaking begins again. I listen, while getting more and more scared, to the breaking for a couple more minutes. I shine my light into the woods and the breaking stops, I turn off the light and it starts back. I waited a couple more minutes and turned my light on again and the breaking stops, I turn the light off and it starts back. I’m lying in the hammock completely terrified at this point and decide the only thing I should do is retreat to the tent with my wife and dogs. It was like torture to be in the hammock. So I quickly grab my sleeping bag, walk to the tent, get in, and lay down. We both heard the branches being broken for about 15 more minutes, then we heard one large break that sounded like a 4 inch log being broken in half that echoed through the woods. It was almost as if they were saying ‘And stay out’. I was so terrified and my adrenaline was pumping so much that I couldn’t sleep for about an hour. The next day my wife and I look around the area for any sign of foot print or the branches themselves. I didn’t find any sign of activity. We did find a grassy area with three large rock piles. Two of the piles were old and had trees growing out of the pile, one was newer with nothing but small vegetation growing on top. One thing to keep in mind is that the area is frequented by campers so there are few branches, especially large ones, on the ground for anything to step on; and there are paths all through the area and as we all know animals will always take the easiest route when traveling. Something else we thought of is Saturday we both went to the bathroom deep in the woods, we thought ""what if we encroached in their land?"". Before I was skeptical but now I know there is something out there and this experience has truly changed my life."
67540,Report 67540: Gold panner reports rocks thrown in frequent sighting zone within Uwharrie National Forest,Class B,2014-04-15T12:00:00Z,35.25048,-79.86721,2014,North Carolina,67540.0,"This happened around 2014 in the Thickety Creek community of Montgomery County, south of the county seat of Troy. A friend at church asked me if I could come down and check his creek for gold. He knew I liked to do some gold panning as a hobby. We never settled on a day or time, I just told him I would come by one day when I got a chance. I ended up getting off work early one day and decided to run down and wash some rocks. So, I parked at his gate and grabbed my backpack at gear and walked about 200 yards from the road. To my left is the creek with about 4ft banks and a steep mountain to my right. I walked down looking for a place to easily get down into the creek without lots of brush. This area is well known for huge Timber Rattlers. So I find a spot next to a huge flat rock that I end up using as a work station. After a couple hours of panning I stopped to take a break. I always freeze a 2 liter bottle of water and drink it as it melts. I’m standing there drinking the water and I hear something fly through the trees above my head. My first thought was “I’ve never heard a bird fly through the trees and hit limbs and leaves like that! Why is it doing that?” So as I stand there puzzled and confused I hear more commotion coming through the tree tops! This time my eyes focus on the sound and I see a rock about the size of a Jr sized football flying over my head and on the bank on the other side of the creek! As I stand there stunned, racking my brain try to make sense of it, I unsnap my 9mm and shout in that direction “You stay over there and I’ll stay over here!” Needless to say I packed up and left, feeling like I’m being watched the whole time! I threw my stuff in the back of my truck and hauled buggy out of there! I don’t know of any animal in the woods that can throw a rock that big that far! I was so effected that I gave up gold panning and hunting for the most part! I never told the land owner or anybody else for that matter for a few years. I still don’t tell many folks. I feel like I have to keep inside or people will think I’m crazy."

69464,Report 69464: Large trees shaking 15 miles SW of Asheville,Class B,2016-06-15T12:00:00Z,35.2725,-82.65414,2016,North Carolina,69464.0,"I live near Asheville NC. I own a landscaping & Irrigation company. I grew up about an hour east. My parents had 30 acres that was surrounded by 6,000 acres of game land. I've played in the woods, hunted, and camped my whole life. Plus my business also allows me to be outside year round. I was starting up a irrigation system in a large gated & wooded golf community in the mountains of Arden NC basically 15 mins from Asheville. This community joins Pisgah National Forest, approximately 300 square miles of forest. This was around April or June of 2016. I was standing in the back yard facing the control box which is attached to the house. So my back was to the woods maybe 25 to 30 yards to the tree line. And I hear this large crash. The same sound a large tree makes as it falls through other tree limbs when its falling. I turned quickly to see a massive Beach tree rocking back and forth. Leaves were floating down but no tree was falling. I've been in trees this size. I'm 6'2 250 pounds. There is no way I could make this tree rock like this. But i didn't see what did it. So watched for probably 30 or 45 seconds. Nothing happened so turned to finish my work. Then it happened again but a different tree. This time I knew something was up. Bears don't jump from tree to tree like that. So I walked to the edge of the yard and watched for a few minutes. No movement in the trees. The canopy is really thick here. The only way I could have really seen anything that was hiding would have been to walk to the bottom of the tree and look up. But I wasn't about to do that. So after a while I walked back to the control again but I walked backwards. Seems silly but I felt whatever it was it was watching me. When I reached the control I turned to face it. Then turned back to the woods again quickly to see if I could trick it or catch it jumping. But nothing happened. So I started working again assuming the show was over. Then it happened again, a third big tree was rocking after the loud crash. At this point I was freaked out so ran to the truck and left. Rescheduled the job. I've been in the forst my whole life. I've never been afraid in the day time. Bears don't do that. They climb up and down. Cats don't make loud crashes if they would have they would have run after the first one. What ever did this has to be huge. I couldn't make those trees rock if i wanted to. Plus it was watching and waiting for the perfect time to jump so I wouldn't see it. Bears here aren't that worried about being seen. They know they can't be hunted in those developments. You have to make them leave. This was something different. I wish I had the balls to walk to the base of the trees. But I don't. I was afraid. I've been training to handle myself. I always carry a gun. But this wasn't something I could handle. I just know ."
59757,Report 59757: Possible daylight sighting of a Sasquatch on the Omaha Indian Reservation,Class B,2018-05-25T12:00:00Z,42.15685,-96.34203,2018,Nebraska,59757.0,"I was northeast of Macy Nebraska along the Missouri River taking part in an expedition hosted by members of the Omaha Indian tribe. We were on the Omaha Reservation.  These tribal members say they've had many sightings in the hilly bluff zone extending for miles along the west flank of the Missouri River Basin. Five of us had decided to take a day hike to see a possible “X” structure. As we started up the path it became known that to get to the “X” we’d have to veer off the main path and bushwhack through the weeds. Two people did this while three of us decided to stay on the clearer but muddy path. (I still have never seen this ""X"" but pictures are available.) As we headed up the trail one of my Native American companions said he was hearing movement in the woods to our right. At this point we could not see very far off the path as trees and brush blocked the view. I did not hear the movement. We continued forward and came to an area where trees had been cut down in the past. We could see maybe 40-50 yards back into the forest. Two of us looked to our right as soon as we made it to this clearer area and immediately saw movement. I saw a long light brown object that was swinging downward from a horizontal position toward. It was not indicative of any other animal that I can think of and was bent slightly at an apparent elbow. I could not see a hand because of the brush. At the time of the sighting the other witness started telling us what HE just saw. He said “I just saw one” and described seeing the whole upper body of a light brown Sasquatch. Apparently when it noticed us it started to drop down and move to its right (our left) behind cover. He said as it was ducking down the arm had swung way up in the air and back down, and he demonstrated. His description and demonstration exactly matched what I had seen. He did not know that I had also seen it as he was telling me his story. I took a picture of the area where the sighting happened. This subject was behind and to the right of a stick pointing upward. On July 27th 2018, I revisited the location with BFRO investigator T. Bell and hacked my way back into this spot. We determined that the top of the stick is about 11 feet high, making the top of the swinging ‘arm’ at around 9 feet tall. On the day of the sighting I was not prepared to bushwhack back into the site where the subject was seen. I was better prepared when we returned on July 27th. I have already done an interview with the BFRO investigator just after our recreation attempt. This subject was MUCH larger than me. It could very easily be 10 + feet as it was already ducking away when I saw it."

52031,Report 52031: Family reports strange ongoing activity near Greenville,Class B,2016-07-08T12:00:00Z,42.78378,-71.77646,2016,New Hampshire,52031.0,"I have not had a visual incident, but several strange experiences around my area recently have led me to try want to talk to someone who might know what is going on. Here I'll list the experiences: 1. I have a small orchard next to the forest in back of my house. 2 years ago, a young pear tree was bearing fruit for the first time, loaded with pears, there must have been 20-30 pears on it. I checked them one evening and decided that the next day I would come out and pick them. The next morning, I came out with a basket and every one of them was gone. Not only gone but every branch that had had a pear was broken. The top branches were about 10ft high so what ever took the top pears had to be tall. At the time, I didn't even consider a bigfoot and thought it might be a moose which we have go through the yard periodically. But I have not heard that moose eat pears and certainly not every one on the tree. Usually when deer eat my apples, they rarely eat more than 1/2 an apple at a time. Since that time I have put an electric fence around the orchard and the tree is recovering. 2. My workshop is down the street from my house, in my barn. About 1.5 years ago, I was walking up from the barn to the house and it was pitch black, in the evening. I could only barely see the road. Just before my house there is a patch of hemlock trees. As I passed the trees I encountered a very strong scent of wet dog. It had been raining all day but had stopped but everything was wet. The smell was overpowering and so strong that I stopped to see what it was. I peered into the trees but couldn't see anything. I walked past the trees and past the smell, walked back to the trees and the smell was still there. The trees are about 15-20 ft from the middle of the road where I was. I have to say I was a bit afraid as we do have some big bears around and didn't want to aggravate one, but I doubt a bear would have stayed still. My experience with bears is that they don't like being around humans and the ones around here are certainly not afraid of humans and usually just walk away. Whatever this was didn't move. So I went into the house. I definitely felt like I was being watched. 3. 1 year ago my wife and I were woken up around 1 am to the sound of a screaming woman in the woods, or what sounded like one. It was very loud, certainly louder than a woman would have been able to make, and it woke both of us up. After the screaming stopped, there was a pack of coyotes who yipped for a while from the same area. Then another sound of the woman screaming, then more coyotes, then more screaming and then more coyotes, then nothing. We went back to bed. We had heard the woman screaming sound before, years ago, in the middle of the day, and had gone out to find out what was going on but found nothing. We do have cougars here though and it may have been one of them. 4. A few weeks ago, at about 10 pm, my wife, myself and my son were sitting in the living room. It had been raining and foggy all day and was still drizzling out. It was pitch black and we couldn't see anything outside. All of a sudden, a rock hit the side of the house nearest the woods. It must have been about the size of a large marble. We immediately opened the door, but it was totally quiet and nothing more happened. 5. My daughter was visiting two weeks ago, and she was here for a week. She came on a Sunday and the next Friday she complained to me that she hadn't been able to sleep because of the screams in the woods. She asked me if I had heard them but I had slept through them. She said they were about midnight to 1 am and were accompanied by the sounds of a pack of coyotes. She described the screams but I of course cannot repeat them on this note, however, when she tried to repeat them, they are like nothing I've ever heard. She said they repeated for four nights. On Friday night, we stayed up trying to hear them but they did not reappear. 6. My daughter's dog stayed with us last fall for 5 months. She is a small black lab and loves to explore our field near the  woods. But many times, during the day even, when we went to let her outside, she refused to go out the door. She would sniff and then back away from the door. I still don't know why. Some days she would go out willingly, and some not. 7. The most recent was a few days ago. It was our first day above 90 degrees and I was traveling down Rte 31 north from Greenville along the Souhegan river. I was looking down the river on the right as the river arced away from the road and saw, some distance down the river, a large animal on all fours standing in the river.My first thought was that it was a bear. It was large, as the black bears we've seen around here are quite large. But it was cinnamon colored, quite a light color and the fur was at least 4"" long. I couldn't see its head. One of the bears here stood up against the screen door of my next door neighbor and my neighbor is 6'2"" and the bear stood as tall as he is, and I thought as I looked at this animal that it was at least that big. I know cinnamon is a variation of black bears, but the fur didn't look right, it was much too long and shaggy. The fur was so long that I couldn't see the joint between the legs and body. I should have stopped to get a better look but I was in a rush and didn't. 8. The last experience I had was in March. I was walking in the forest on a trail. In the distance, I heard someone hit a tree with a stick three times. I remembered that this is what bigfoot sometimes do from the online reports. I thought about that, and then walked on. About 100 feet later, it happened again. I thought, ""If this is a bigfoot, I don't want to meet him today"". I finished my walk without incident. So in sum, what is all this? Am I imagining something or what? Any suggestions? Do you have any similar reports from near here (southern NK)? I know bigfoot has been cited near here several times in the past in nearby towns.

We were out on the back deck which boarders the mountains and the golf course.  My brother in law and sister with me.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw an approximately 7 1/2 - 8 foot large figure that walked with a long steady gate,  with long arms and a thick chest.  It walked steadily down the mountain side glancing at us and continuing to walk.  We all looked at each other before running inside.  We all saw the exact same thing."

49096,Report 49096: Campers have possible encounter while staying in High Point State Park,Class B,2015-06-23T12:00:00Z,41.29453,-74.68758,2015,New Jersey,49096.0,"My brother and I camped overnight in High Point State Park, New Jersey, the other night. Driving around the park, the camping sites were labeled with numbers. We wanted to set up in a place as far away as we could from the other people. I myself, have known the existence of Sasquatch to be real for quite some time. Not from a personal experience which was yet to come, but because of watching so many people tell their stories of encounters, and just seeing the genuine fright and truthfulness in their eyes when they tell their stories. My brother however, always laughed at the subject of Bigfoot, and was a complete skeptic. So, my brother and I has set up camp on the edge of what I'm assuming was the only lake in the park. We walked through the forest in the daytime, and indeed found many peculiar structures and tree breaks I had seen before on Bigfoot TV shows. As night fell, we made a fire, and watched the numerous stars reveal themselves as the night got darker. Around 12 o'clock at night I went over to a rock right by the edge of the lake and looked up at the stars, while my brother tended the fire. I'm an astronomy fan, so before I knew it I had been sitting there for two hours when I checked my phone and it said it was nearing 2 in the morning. Just then my phone ran out of battery. While sitting on the rock, I began to feel a weird sensation that someone or something was watching me, I checked to see if it was my brother but he was staring into the fire. I dismissed this feeling and told myself I had just brought it on myself. I looked back up at the stars and got lost in some train of thought when all of the sudden, something made a very loud noise that could only be described as a very large man exhaling aggressively towards me. I jumped up and ran to my brother, and we heard the thing walk towards the forest, all the while breaking branches and continuing to make the same aggressive noise I heard so close to me. It got quiet, and my brother and I were standing looking in the direction where all the noise had came from when it made the noise again. Now, I don't speak Sasquatch but that thing was telling us to get the heck out of there. I don't get scared easily at all, and I was shaking like I never had before. I felt so much negative energy and decided I was too scared to stay outside, so we went to the car and sat inside, praying whatever made that noise didn't come back. My brother described the sound as sounding like someone ripping a tent. Whatever the noise was, absolutely no common animal could have made it. After a sleepless night, when it got light out again around 5:30, we built up the courage to go back where we heard the noise to see if there were any indications of what made it. And when we got there, I was shocked. There was a makeshift bed made from giant leaves that was fit for a very large creature. I could see the exact spot where the thing that had made the noise was watching me, and where it walked away, as there was a clear path of flattened grass and plants leading up the forest. The area was wet and muddy, and indeed there were footprints. But, as I was taking pictures the path leading from the bed to the upper forest, it happened again. The thing made the same exact noise, this time it was so close, I nearly fell. We ran back to our campsite and listened. But nothing made a sound. We stayed there for about 30 minutes until I decided to go back and see if there were fresh prints or anything I could take back as proof. I took more pictures, and i was standing on the trail leading back to our campsite looking at the pictures I had taken when again, the thing made the same noise! This time it was on the side of me that I would have to run past it to get back to the campsite. As soon as I heard it, it felt like my heart literally dropped and my legs became wobbly, but I summed up my courage and once again ran back to the campsite in fear. It was only about 10 seconds away, and when I got there my brother was standing there wide eyed asking if I had heard the noise. Whatever it was, it was not happy and we heard it walk up into the forest breaking branches and exhaling aggressively as it headed deeper into the forest. At this point my brother wanted to get the heck out of there, but I needed to see it. I went up to the road right before the forest where we had heard it go in, and looked around, but saw nothing. I was so confused on how the heck it ever got so close to me without me seeing or hearing it walk at all. While I was walking on the road, I saw my brother walk up from the campsite looking around. When he spotted me, he sighed in relief and told me he though I was getting attacked because he heard a bunch of human like screams coming from the forest. I walked towards where he was and started to hear them too, but by the time I reached him the screams started to sound like some kind of weird chatter. My brother, the skeptic, was so scared he told me were packing up and leaving right away. I have no doubt in my mind that we just happened to pick a campsite right next to where a Sasquatch was sleeping, and he was just not happy about that. I know what we heard was a Sasquatch. My brother entered a skeptic, but left a full believer in Bigfoot."
49883,Report 49883: Recollection of a possible late night stalking on Waterloo Road in Allamuchy,Class B,2015-10-02T12:00:00Z,40.89452,-74.79077,2015,New Jersey,49883.0,"It was August of 1977 and I had missed my ride home from Hacketstown NJ to Byram NJ. The road to get back to Byram is Waterloo Rd. It was about 9:30-10:00 PM so I decided to hitch hike it on Waterloo hoping that someone would give me a lift back to HWY-206. It was very dark and as I was walking past Stephens State Park and then the old Saxton Falls area, I could hear something that sounded like it was on 2 feet stalking me in the woods on the ridge side of Waterloo Rd. It got very interesting when I started sprinting, it also started sprinting keeping up with me for what seemed like at least a mile. When I would walk, it would walk. It was loud as it went thru the woods as I stayed on the road hoping for a car to pick me up. Eventually I did get a ride near a few houses after passing an old Tavern on the river side of Waterloo Rd."
55961,Report 55961: Men see upright creature walking in front of a home at dusk near Ocean City,Class B,2016-11-16T12:00:00Z,39.22348,-74.69759,2016,New Jersey,55961.0,"At approximately 7 PM on Wednesday, November 16, Jon E., Dan F., Dan W. and James O. and I met at my house to watch a Philadelphia 76er's game.  While watching, Dan F. noticed a human-like creature walking in the street in front of my house.  From the living room window, we all observed a creature which appeared to be just under six feet tall walking away from my house.  The creature was about 150 feet away and passed under a street light, which gave us the ability to get a decent look at it.  It was long limbed, but clearly not human.  Because of the lighting it was in silhouette, but we could see that it was covered with hair.  It was walking with its shoulders hunched forward, and did not appear to be in any distress.  We watched it pass from view as it went behind trees and into the woods on the far side of the street. I live in a quiet neighborhood that is located in a wooded area.  My house is on a street that is a cul-de-sac, and there is very little traffic.  There is a quarry less than a quarter mile away through the woods.  In the 14 years that I have owned this house, I have routinely heard animal calls that can't be identified as dog barks, etc., and have seen droppings and footprints in the woods that have not been from any animal such as a deer, etc., that would be seen in this area. This is the first instance in which I have seen a creature that I believe is a bigfoot.  Because we were all shocked by what we saw, we did not attempt to pursue this creature, but we were able to observe it for 5-7 seconds before it passed from view. In the minutes that followed, we all discussed what we saw.  While my friends, who do not live in this neighborhood, were initially reluctant to acknowledge that it was a bigfoot, after I explained the things that I have heard and seen around my house over the years, we all agreed that the creature was not human, and clearly fit the description of a bigfoot.  Please contact me so I can provide further information about this sighting."
59280,Report 59280: Couple have possible daytime encounter in the Pine Barrens near the town of Brown Mills,Class B,2018-04-07T12:00:00Z,39.94853,-74.42721,2018,New Jersey,59280.0,My husband and I were taking a woods cruise and were driving in the northern section of Brendan T. Byrne Forest on St Mary's road. It came to a dead end so we stopped to look around and there was a pond and a little path so we decided to walk our dog for a bit. We had only gone in a little ways when we smelled kind of musty mildew odor typically not smelled in the woods. This kind of freaked my husband out and he wanted to go back to the car. So we started back the way we came and then turned down Buckingham Whiting road. We drove this for a bit and came across a little bridge. We stopped because I like taking pictures of the water. After a bit we started to drive off. I am driving and in a split second I saw something brown on 2 legs and about 6 feet tall sprint behind the car in the area we were just in. I caught it in my rear view mirror. I was kind of thinking to myself that my eyes were playing tricks on me but I just couldn't shake it. I stopped the car and husband told me to go in reverse. As we approached the area he thought he heard branches snapping and a splash into the water. He didn't see anything so we drove on. We just kept talking about what I saw and if it was a bear a deer a person. I said it was definitely on 2 legs. It was quick and it was light brown but thin. We drove a little more and turned around and went back. On our way back I thought something was rubbing in my brakes because we heard like a wuh wuh wuh wuh wuh - we stopped and he looked under my car and didn't see anything. He thought maybe it was what I saw making a warning call.
72283,Report 72283: Gov-connected snake researcher describes daytime encounter in Pine Barrens swamps,Class B,2018-06-16T12:00:00Z,39.71742,-74.72394,2018,New Jersey,72283.0,"Have been out scouting research locations for snake studies on google earth and found an area that we really wanted to check out which was an open paleodune ridge that offered plenty of basking/nesting habitat that the snakes we were researching liked to use. The hike there was pretty rough, walking through knee deep wetlands at points and wrestling with tangles of greenbrier and other thorny bushes to get to the location which was about a mile and a half back into the woods. Upon finally arriving at the site we were able to settle down and start looking for good spots that the snakes we were looking for used. As we were walking up one of the ridge fingers, we came upon an abandoned hunting stand that looked like it could be used as a shelter. I was a little unnerved because we didn’t really wanna run into someone out there especially if they weren’t expecting company. As I was looking around my friend went back behind me to look around or use the bathroom while I continued to look. I began to hear bipedal walking in the swamp below us, what sounded like sticks breaking and snapping. I was pretty freaked out thinking it was a hunter so I yelled down at it saying “hello? Anyone there?”. No response as I continued to look I saw part of a dark figure go tree from tree. Long enough to know I wasn’t imagining it, but not long enough to identify shape, size and detail. My memory fails to remember exactly how tall off the ground it was but the encounter lasted several seconds, from when I first heard the walking, saw the dark flash and when it subsequently disappeared or stopped in the swamp. After this I rounded up my friend and we headed out of there pretty quickly not knowing if a nearby hunter was there or worse, some crazy dude was stalking us. A few days went by before I really began to realize what I could have seen and it just made little sense that someone was out there  messing with us. Have since returned to the location to look some things over, large game trails surround the dune. But other than that, not much further evidence was able to be found."
69437,Report 69437: Possible Sasquatch wood knocks in forested riverbed beside Chama during lockdown,Class B,2020-07-20T12:00:00Z,36.90237,-106.5784,2020,New Mexico,69437.0,"Summer of 2020 (quarantine year), in late July, I was hiking with a friend along Rio Chama.  Although we were just on the other side of the river from town, the railroad was not running, the campground was closed, and the majority of the town was empty. This was a short day hike as we are seniors. We had a dog accompanying us (pit bull mix) for part of the way.  Before we reached the river we had to return the dog to the car- she became unusually excitable and fearful. Note: my friend and the dog live up on the mountain, the dog is used to wildlife and has treed a bear before. Anyway, windows down and dog much happier, we returned to our walk.  We had crossed the river and was on the trail that runs by the bank when we heard a series of hollow knocking sounds.  These were loud and resonate, not woodpeckers or falling branches.  A short time later they were repeated at a distance- the knocks sounded lighter in tone, like a hit on a more solid wood.  The knocks close to us responded- and we decided that it was in our best interest to leave the area."

We where heading to dock the boat. We heard and seen a big splash we thought it was people. So we asked them to stop but nobody responded we proceeded to head into shore when we noticed another big splash. So then we stopped and we noticed a foul smell, like a wet animal. We then looked towards the bushes and a tall thin tree was shaking very fast back and forth. Then we noticed a big bolder thrown through the air toward us, it hit the water. That's when we realized what the splashing was.Then we noticed a man like figure with red beady eyes when we flashed the light at the bushes about 2 feet above the bushes was the eyes. So we started to bang the boat with the oars to scare away whatever this was.Then we heard a loud scream as we loaded the boat on the truck and left."
55727,Report 55727: Married couple has possible daytime sighting while boating on Lake George,Class B,2015-06-17T12:00:00Z,43.35086,-73.34347,2015,New York,55727.0,"It occurred on a sunny June 17, 2015 around mid afternoon while we were boating along the eastern shore of Lake George, NY, just above the Narrows. The object we saw was located at approximately 43 degrees 35.086 minutes north and 073 degrees 34.347 minutes west per a Google Earth view obtained on 5-5-2015.  We were about 140 yards away (even though it didn't seem that far) and the bearing from us to it was about 132 degrees true, again using Google Earth to obtain distance and bearing.  This section of the lake is state property and part of the ""Forever Wild"" section of the Adirondacks.  There are many square miles of wilderness here and this location is only about 8 miles from the locally famous Whitehall, NY sightings in 1976. We were motoring in our 19' I/O boat northeastish in a narrow channel between Sarah Island, Hazel Island, an un-named rocky outcrop and the mainland.  Our intended goal was Fox Island, a short distance away.  We were traveling about 5 mph, slightly above idling speed, engine rpm would be approximately 1000.  There is a point of land opposite the rocky outcrop and as we cleared it, a small bay exists on our starboard (right) side.  Since I'm always scanning the lake side to side for boat traffic, at that point in time, I was looking to the east into the bay and I noticed movement close to the shoreline.  It seemed that whatever it was, was caught by surprise as we cleared that point of land.  I then got my wife's attention, she looked in that direction and also saw it. My view was of a very large black animate object that seemed to quickly raise an arm (?) from it's side to a horizontal position then turn away and move back and to the side (north) behind a nearby clump of coniferous trees.  I then spun the boat around for a better view.  Meanwhile, my wife (Debbie) was watching it.  Her impression was that it was large, dark, upright and didn't move like an animal.  Her view was slightly restricted by the trees but she did notice that the object was swaying from side to side.  The only (known) animal that is large and black out here in the Adirondacks is the black bear and we both strongly believe it wasn't a bear (I've seen many bears in the woods).  It was an observation of very short duration but long enough to impress us.  Unfortunately we can't provide any accurate dimensions or descriptions of physical details but even though we're not sure of what is was, we're sure of what it was not! We then continued on to Fox Island which is about 200 yards from the sighted critter and only about 50 feet from the mainland and chatted for a bit.  Eventually we got the charcoal grill fired up and proceeded to cook a traditional meal of dogs and beans, of course with the appropriate condiments.  We do this on a regular basis on the islands of the lake.  As we were eating, we both had a weird feeling so we QUICKLY finished our meal, loaded the gear back on the boat and left or as some may say, got the heck out of Dodge.  We've never had that type of experience on the lake before and are not sure if the two events are related.  I've recently become aware that some folks have a theory about how our favorite mystery creature may use/communicate with infrasound which could explain that feeling we both had. We returned to the area on July 6, 2015 by boat with my brother who is an accomplished photographer to investigate the mainland.  By then, the NYDEC had installed docks in that bay so we could tie up to and go ashore.  We went to the area where the critter was first observed and noted that there was a small, probably seasonal stream that flowed into the lake.  We searched for but did not find any tracks or other sign.  However I recently purchased a trail cam and plan to set it up in that area.  Preliminary testing has shown that the motion sensor is very sensitive and wind generated tree movement will trigger it.  I've got a few ideas on how to mount it but am still trying to come up with the appropriate ""bait"".   Got any ideas? Also this spring (2016), I shared our occurrence with BF researcher Bill Brann who runs the Northern Sasquatch Research Society who was present during a public screening of a documentary called Beast of Whitehall, The Abair Road Incident that was made by the Ohio firm, Small Town Monsters.  He then mentioned that he had a report of an anchored boat by Fox Island that had rocks thrown at it at night.  It was probably the same bay which is quite protected from boat traffic. Again, we both have had over 40 years of outdoors experience and are very familiar with Adirondack wildlife.  Debbie is a retired Science teacher and I'm a retired manufacturing engineer of medical devices."
57998,Report 57998: Strange occurrences remembered that happened at a golf course in Syracuse,Class B,2017-10-06T12:00:00Z,43.00972,-76.10047,2017,New York,57998.0,"This is a follow up to my original message as I wanted to add some significant insight to an incident that occurred to me in 1960 at age 14. As I stated previously stated I was a caddy at the time and the foursome I was with was just walking off the green of hole 13 on the private course Club in Syracuse, New York.  As I was walking across the green to replace the pin I heard something falling through a tree directly across from me. You could hear it pass through the tree as the boulder made its descent to the ground. The large rock almost hitting one of the golfers. There was much consternation over this and it was automatically assumed that it came as a result of blasting at General Crushed Stone located behind the golf course on Rock Cut Road. I never heard a blast but there could be no other explanation as large rocks don't just fall out of the sky. However, the rock being hurled into the air by a dynamite blast at the quarry just doesn't hold up in many ways. First off my friend's father worked at the quarry at the time and he said blasting was not large enough to propel a single rock that far as the charges used to quarry the limestone were not that great. Plus this was a single large boulder if it was a blast there would be a shotgun type of pattern of smaller rocks with it, not just one rock sailing into the air. Secondly, the rock that I saw was not a freshly quarried rock which would be gray in color this rock was a surficial rock that was stained from the soil it did not come from a blast site. The boulder was at least 20 pounds in weight and 4"" by 8"" and 3"" thick. It was flat on the top and bottom and stained a yellow brown color as is common of rocks on the surface in that area. However, this rock came down out of the sky vertically as you could tell by the sound of it falling through the entire tree, cutting branches and leaves as it fell it had to have been lifted quite high into the air to come down vertically like it did. It did not smash into the tree on a horizontal trajectory and bounce off the tree. As I stated previously at the end of the game I met up with my friend  who lived on Rock Cut Road at the time as we were going swimming in the spring fed wash ponds at the quarry. The way to get there was to go back to hole 13 and cross the fence into General Crushed Stone property. We were trespassing which at the time we didn't acknowledge.  We stopped and I showed my friend the rock that came out of the sky and both of us believed that it had to have been a blast at the quarry.  We walked on down a grade on a path and that is when we heard a guttural growl off to our left. It was a fearsome growl and I for one shot off down the hill as fast as I could go. We assumed it was an animal. However, what animal growls at a human when the human is not confronting it or even knows it is there? I don't know of any and I certainly don't know what type of animal living in Central New York would or could make itself know in a threatening manner. Normally animals of all type will shun and form of human contact or confrontation. This occurred no more than 100 feet from where the rock had landed under the tree. Plus if you were to place a clock face over the tree that the rock fell through and draw a line out from where the rock had landed which was between the 3 and the 5 those two lines would encompass the vicinity of where the growl came from. As I have stated I never saw anything out of the ordinary and was certainly not aware of ""Bigfoot"" or anything like it being seen in New York State. I had heard of the ""Abominable Snowman"" but that was worlds away. I can't say this is a ""Bigfoot"" encounter, however, two events occurred that is very similar to what others have experienced in Bigfoot sightings. The large rock being hurled at individuals and done so to scare more than injury plus the deep growl the likes of which I had never heard before or since and couldn't to this day equate it to one particular animal. The only thing I am sure of is two events separated in time by only a couple of hours still stand out in my mind these many years later as if they occurred today."

First there was something moving through the wooded area to my left. Sounded like it was on two feet and moving towards some neighbors houses. Wasn’t alarmed by this, although it was dark and there was no flashlight the neighbors do walk through there from time to time. My dog wasn’t alerted at all. This part of the incident may be just coincidental but it’s what happened next that I’m curious about. About five to ten minutes later to the left of me way off in the distance there was an obvious wood knock then immediately to the right of me in the distance but in that direction is the Great Croton Swamp was a reply wood knock and then immediately after that another from the left. Then nothing. I’ve never heard anything like that before. It was about 11pm and the neighborhood was quiet and in my opinion it was an obvious call and response. Are wood knocks usually so instantaneous or do they usually have some time in between?"

I was heading up Corbin Hill towards Cat Rocks, near West Mountain.  I started just before sunset, around 7pm. On my return trip down Corbin Hill, around 9pm, I heard a loud vocalization that I could not identify. It was a loud scream, lasting about 15 seconds. It started low-pitched as a howling ""oooooh"" sound, then got higher pitched as an ""aaaah"" sound.  It didn't sound like an owl or coyote, but more like a primate.  Based on my internet research, it sounded most like a gibbon's call, but deeper.  I heard no further vocalizations. I cannot confirm that what I heard was a Sasquatch, but I felt it was important to report."

We got into the woods before daybreak. As daylight was approaching the woods never got active. No animals or birds were heard or were visible. About 2 hours into the hunt, all was quiet. It was then that I heard a very loud wood knock. Startled the hell out of me. It was northeast of me in the swamp. My first thought was, ""You can't be serious."" A wood knock here? I stayed put for another hour, hour and a half. Then made my way back to my vehicle. My brother was already there. His first words were, ""Did you hear that wood knock?"" We discussed it and came to the conclusion that something weird was going on. About 3 weeks later during gun season the same damn thing happened in the same area."

At first I thought it was a large man in a fur coat because I could see its arms, legs, head, and torso; but this creature was much too big to be a man and the fur seemed to be covering its entire body. It was about 1/3 the size of the telephone poles (about 30ft poles) that made up the powerlines and was walking enough to them for me to have a good comparison. That would make this thing about 8-10ft tall roughly. It had it's back to me and seemed to be casually ""strolling"" North along the path the powerlines went. It was moving slow and didn't seem spooked by any of the traffic on the road. But it was a good 100-125 yards down the powerlines so maybe that's why it wasn't spooked."

It was a unique sound because it was a very distinct ""caploosh Gloomp"". ""caploosh Gloomp."" It sounded like when I have walked through knee deep water in the past. Then, I heard a roar like nothing I have ever heard before. It sounded angry and a bit like a lion. There was splashing and then the sound of a squealing animal in distress, followed by more splashing and more roaring. Immediately, I started looking around in all directions but could not see anything. The sound was so vivid. I felt I was in danger and that whatever was harming this small animal was going to harm me and may even jump in the boat. Paralyzed with fear, I used the quiet electric trolling motor to get as far away from shore as I could with creating any disturbance. I woke my dad up who was napping and he heard the tail end of the encounter and instructed me to immediately start the motor and get out of there. We headed back to the marina and went inside to get a snack and drink. We had not known what we had encountered or if anyone would ever believe us. We were discussing the incident between us. Just then, a man behind the serving counter asked us what was wrong and could sense the fear in our faces. We told him of our encounter and he did not seem to be surprised. He told us that a few years ago a news crew showed up at this lake to do a report on a ""Bigfoot"" sighting. Until that time neither my dad or me suspected a Bigfoot, nor had we heard of anything like it. From that point on, I have been convinced that it might have been. In my mind I ruled out a short or four legged animal because of the sound of the distinct footsteps in the water. The aggression of the splashing and roars could have only been made from a large animal. One thing to note is that the woods and forest surrounding the lake are very, very dense and have often commented to my dad that it would be very difficult to get onto the shore. I have told this story many times and have been ridiculed. I hope you will believe me."

44262,Report 44262: Possible daylight sighting by a couple at Geneva-on-the-Lake State Park,Class B,2014-02-15T12:00:00Z,41.85256,-80.96186,2014,Ohio,44262.0,"On February 15th, 2014 at approximately 4 pm my wife, 2 children and I were driving into Geneva State Park. It had been frigid cold and we wanted to see how frozen over the lake and marina were.  At the corner of Padinarum and Lake Road I jokingly asked my daughter if she had “passed gas”…..I was told NO!!  My wife made a comment that the really bad smell was coming from outside.  We often times drive through the State Park watching for wildlife.  We drove slowly through the marina parking lot and stopped for just a few moments.  We noticed there was one truck in the parking lot and two others pulled closer to the lake.  They appeared to all belong to the same snow removal service as they were out of their trucks talking to one another.   As we were pulling out maybe 10 minutes later we were approaching the first curve just outside of the parking lot and I noticed something walking about 50 to 60 yards from the road and it was moving in an easterly direction.  My first thought was it was a person.  I told my wife to stop and she too saw it.  She said it was furry but at the angle I was looking I was unable to make out anything except a very dark figure that “seemed” tall and was definitely walking on two legs.  My wife later told me that she saw arms swaying. In an instant it was GONE!!!  I got out of the vehicle and walked about 40 yards in.  I was unable to spot any sign that would make me think it was anything but a person.  Although, being that the temperature was 15 degrees with a feel like temp in the low single digits I wondered why anyone would be out in this weather. There was also heavy snow on the ground.   I did see some snowmobile tracks but we always drive through the park with the windows down and nobody in the family had heard any engines at all!!  I returned to the vehicle and we drove a short distance to Crabapple Picnic Area parking lot.  We pulled all the way around the large lot and stopped just about 20 yds from the exit and stopped the van.  My wife shut the van off and we told the kids to be quiet.  My wife asked me to whoop or mimic a Bigfoot yell.  I whooped once……nothing.  I waited about a whole minute and let out three large whoops.  Something whooped back!!!!!!!  In a 5 min span of time we heard 2 distinct whoops, 1 scream, and two wood knocks.(We did NOT do any wood knocks at all)   We did NOT see anything else though.  It was difficult to control the excitement in the vehicle.  I am certainly NOT saying that my wife and I had seen a Bigfoot, but we did see a bipedal “something” and heard some very distinct noises, and finally smelled something really nasty.  I hope that if anyone else had any type of sighting in and around this area they would come forward and share it.  OR….if someone KNOWS they were walking in that area at about that time, that would be nice to know too."

With it being the last day for gun season, I decided to go much further than I've gone into the woods, mainly to get away from the main parking area. I started down the equine trail towards the south. I walked a good forty five minutes before deciding I was good and far away from the ""Bang bangers"", and not likely to get hit with a deerslug. As usual, I hunted til I could not see twenty yards, and started to get my gear together. I heard a couple loud cool owl hoots by the time I had my gear stowed, when I heard a howl that made me stop and compare to things I've heard in the past. The only description that comes to mind is the howl done by the lady on Bigfoot Hunter, the name escapes me at the moment. Logical thinking told myself it was probably a coyote, but for grins, I picked up a short solid branch and gave the nearest tree a couple good whacks. I listened for a couple minutes, and not hearing anything, I loaded my ghost blind and pack onto my back, picked up my crossbow and started my long walk back to the parking area. I was walking for less than five minutes when from in the distance behind me, came two loud knocks, followed by a long drawn out ""Yip"". Needless to say, I wasted no time getting back to my truck. Twin Bridges Rd is off route 133, south of Williamsburg."

They come out in the evening to graze near the lake. We took a few photos of the deer then decided to leave because it was getting dark. As we were leaving the park (two lane road with heavy woods on both sides of road), I had been talking to him (he was driving and I was in the passenger seat) when I turned my head forward and noticed something a short distance in front of us next to the side of the road. There was something tall and very dark that was hard to make out. As we slowly passed it I could finally see it and realize it was a Sasquatch. It was very large with a chest about 3 feet wide and stood about 7 to 8 feet tall. It was not moving, it was just standing there looking down the road from whence we had just come. I said to my grandson ""what was that” and he could not answer. We kept driving out of the park too afraid to turn around and go back. It had come out of the woods and was probably getting ready to cross into the heavy woods across the road. That animal was huge and looked very powerful. I was shocked because it is a busy park but with a lot of deer and people with picnics. I forgot to mention it was late, somewhere around 8 PM, the sun had already gone down but we were still able to make out object from the twilight."

My wife and I were camping at Mohican State Park in east central Ohio. We were camping in our van. My wife went to bed at about 10:30PM, I turned in about 1:30AM. I had to leave the van to relieve myself. I opened the van's side door. I have the interior lights set not to come on when the doors are opened. I glanced around outside, as I always do, and stepped out of the van. The center of the road, running through the camping area is about 25 to 30 ft. from where I was standing. On my side of the road there are individual campsites bordering the road, on the other side of the road is the Mohican River. My dying campfire cast a faint glow, the slightly overcast sky provided separation from the skyline and the tree line in the immediate area. Out of the corner of my eyes I detected a slight movement on the road but everything was bathed in shadow from the trees. I felt I was seeing a shadow of something. I leaned forward peering into the darkness for a better look. The shadowed form booted toward the entrance of the camp area. All I could see was its silhouette. It was upright and moving on two feet. It stood at least 8ft high. I watched in disbelief as it covered about 50ft distance with what seemed like 5 or 6 strides and disappeared into the darkness. I did notice that it had a slender appearance. I knew at once it was a Bigfoot. I had heard of other sightings in the area. I stood there, still in disbelief, running through my mind what I had just seen. I questioned everything else it could have been. Nothing else fit. My mind finally told me, ""Robert, you know what you saw. A Bigfoot."""

50393,Report 50393: Two deer hunters experience a likely week-long encounter near Nashport,Class B,2015-12-01T12:00:00Z,40.01209,-82.13298,2015,Ohio,50393.0,"Location, Nashport, Ohio, Near Dillon State Park. This is an account of events that transpired during mine and my friends 5 day hunting trip on a 40 acre tract in Nashport, Ohio, in Muskingum County. This land adjoins Dillon State Park, which is 2,285 acres of state ground. Both my friend and I are experienced woodsmen and hunters, in having been in nature our whole lives. We are confident in our knowledge of animals, their behavior, and calls. This compiling of events at times left us confused, awestruck and at a loss for words. We both went into the woods with the understanding that there are some things that cannot be explained or fully understood yet. However, we left our trip with a much greater understanding than we thought imaginable when planning this trip. 12/1/15 Tuesday Just after dusk. Light rain and no wind. We heard a large tree knocked over in the woods. There was no wind or outside influence that should have caused the tree to crash down. About 30-45 minutes later, we heard a second tree fall, which sounded larger. Around 8pm we began to hear tree knocks coming from 3 different locations simultaneously. The first 2 sounded like someone hitting 2x4’s together. The 3rd on the other hand was much louder. It sounded like someone hit the tree with a very large Louisville Slugger. Around 10pm, we heard what sounded like someone walking through the woods whistling. It was a human-like whistle, but we were the only people around. At about 3am, my friend stepped out of the camper to use the bathroom. Upon walking outside, he heard another loud tree knock from the 3rd location as before. 12/2/15 Wednesday We hunted all day and returned to camp. After dark, the tree knocks began. This time it was only 2 locations. Around 10 to 10:30pm we began to hear whooping sounds coming off of a ridge about a ¼ of a mile away. Still inside the camper, the sounds were so loud we could feel them. The whoops lasted 15-20 seconds without pause. Within 5 minutes we heard the call again, but this time the duration of the call was shorter. We stepped outside of the camper to get a better sound quality and then heard a 3rd set of whoops, this time so loud the calls could be felt in your chest. When these calls were finally finished the woods and entire area around us went quiet. Not a sound. Just as the night before we continued to hear wood knocks. Also noted we could hear something banging/ beating on cars in the junkyard below our camp site. At times it was so loud whatever this was seemed to be upset and trying to rip off a car door. The junkyard is inaccessible at night.  Just as the night before my friend awoke around 3am to use the bathroom and upon stepping out of the camper was confronted with a very loud knock from the same area as the night before. 12/3/15 Thursday The evening was quiet until about 9-9:30pm. Out of the blue, we heard a very long, very deep, aggressive almost tarzan like yell coming from the same ridge as the whoops the night before. This brought a chill down our spines it was so loud. It was long and powerful and lasted a solid 20 seconds. Trees knocks continued from the same areas as previous nights almost like we were being observed all evening. They were lesser in frequency on this evening however. About an hour later we began to hear coyotes yipping near the same ridge as all the calls have been coming from. There was an answer to the coyotes, which was similar but definitely not a coyote. The tone and pitch were different and it was much louder. It was very bone chilling to say the least. Shortly after this we could hear growling sounding like it was coming from just outside the camper. We loaded our guns and prepared for an encounter with whatever was out there. We stepped out with a bright flashlight but we could not spot anything. The tree knocks continued until we went to bed. 12/4/15 Friday Sitting around the fire around 9pm, we heard another tarzan yell, this time it was on a further ridge. Guessing around a ½ to ¾ of a mile away. It was long and as loud of a call as the evening before, just further off in the distance. It was quiet again until about 9:45. From the lake and waterway about a ¼ to ½ mile away, we heard a blood curdling high pitched scream. Also by the water way is a long set of rail road tracks that I wanted to note of here. From this point on we heard screams every 5 seconds. The screams progressively came closer and closer, moving down the creek bottom between the two large ridges. In no more than 30-60 seconds, the screaming had moved from the waterway again about a ¼ to ½ a mile away to what sounded like 100 to 150 yards away at the tree line. About 10 to 15 seconds later we heard what sounded like someone or something jumping on the hood of a car and over the 8ft tall (give or take) junkyard fence, clipping it as it went over. This was astonishing because in this 10 to 15 seconds of time this thing moved through 400 yards of heavy cover. I do not know of any person or animal that could do this that would also be responsible for these noises. A few minutes after all of this commotion, we heard the same blood curdling screams coming off the ridge behind us as all of the screams as the nights before. 12/5/15 Saturday We set up a two man deer drive for the morning down the same ridges and holler from where the screams the night before were moving through. Moving as quickly as possible, it still took me an hour to cover and navigate the same ground as the high pitched screaming the night before. We decided to check out the area around the waterway for tracks to try and confirm what we thought we had been hearing throughout the week. At one end of the spillway, the water had receded to depths of only about 4 inches. There were nearly 20 tracks coming from the main ravine and rail road tracks and into the shallow end of the spillway. They all enter at the same place but veer off in 3 different directions. The tracks appeared to be 14-16 inches in length, 3-4 inches at the heel and 6 to 8 inches at the toe. This creature appeared to have a stride of nearly or about 5ft toe to toe. My friend documented these as pictures on his cell phone. Upon further investigation we found more tracks 20-30 yards away in the sand on the bank. We took pictures of these as well. One set was slightly smaller but when up next to my 11 ½ size hunting boot it dwarfed my feet in comparison. We found another, larger track near these. This footprint was 16-18 inches long at least 4 inches at the heel and 8 inches or more at the toes. It was an older track but still stood out to us. We have a clear picture of this track up against my friends size 13 hunting boot and this track just swallowed it. These impressions sunk deeper than anything my friend or myself could recreate, and we are not small men at 210 and 185 lbs respectively. Investigating the bank line we could see multiple shellfish that had been eaten (potential secondary food source to all of the gut piles and wounded deer from gun season) There were no other animal tracks in the area that would have been known to be feeding on these aka raccoons. Also noted we noticed multiple footprints that looked to be from a child barefoot. These looked fresh. Why someone would let their child run around barefoot in December in cold water and mud is beyond me? Still not sure what to make of this. 12/6/15 Monday Upon returning home I spoke to my girlfriend about what had gone on during our hunting trip and finding the tracks and she was mind blown and interested. Since the tracks were on public land and deer gun season was over I know it would be safe to take her down to the water and show her the tracks and let her see the area. First I took her down to a sand bar to show her an angle I had at a nice deer on Wednesday. When we got down there she said wow bigfoot. When we looked down there was a fresh set of tracks in the 14-16 inch range very similar to the other ones noted already. They were so fresh you could see where the mud had squished up between its toes.  She took pictures on her phone with her feet next to them as reference. I then took her over to the sandy bank and showed her the tracks my friend and I had found to get a second set of pictures. Upon getting over there we found another type of track. It was roughly 14 inches in length but appeared to have severe hammer toe and or arthritis. It was roughly 4 inches at the heel and roughly 8 inches at the toes. We took pictures of this track as well. When exploring near the wood line I noticed how a very large creature had been moving through there. I found a large impression in the leaves. I began to remove them to get a better look at what was below. We found what appears to be very very large footprints. These were between 20 and 24 inches in length, well over 5 inches at the heel, and 10 to 12 inches at the toe. A picture was also taken of this impression. Upon seeing these the feeling of being watched began to overwhelm my girlfriend and we quietly left the area. At the end of this trip we left with some astounding experiences and a sense of shock. However, we both feel this is not a series of coincidences or random actions. Given our encounters and physical evidence which we were able to document, we strongly feel there is one explanation Bigfoot. Being experienced trackers, we feel these creatures are using the railroad tracks as a highway to come and go with minimal trace. Our interactions this week led two outdoorsmen who are very comfortable in uninhabited woods to sleep with loaded guns within arm’s reach. Each of us there will think twice before staying or wondering near or in nearly untouched woods at night alone. Although we did not get a visual, we fully believe this creature is large, athletic and completely in its element in the woods at dark."

This is when I rounded the bend and saw a print on the trail going the opposite direction of whatever I heard scamper away. The ground was hard and the print was only about 1/4"" in the dirt. There were no other people prints or anything on the trail, As I'm taking pictures, something crashes in the trees above me... I covered my head waiting for a big branch to fall on me. After that, I high tailed it out of there. I left passing another half a dozen people on their way in as I made my way out. I never expected or was looking for anything on such a populated path. If it wasn't for the fact I had heard something right before and right after I found the print, I would have seriously leaned toward a fake."

It appeared to be a fresh break and considering it was so close to the footprint we thought it was odd.

We were heading east bound on 36 when we both witnessed in our headlights a shadowy figure sprint across the road from north to south. When I say sprint, I mean like a 100m dash sprinter or faster. It was about 30 yards or so in front of our car with another car coming from the other direction. It was probably 20 yards from the other car. I asked her, ""Did you see that?"" I told her that I saw a figure run across the road and I could see its legs. She responded that she did see a shadowy figure run across the road too, but was not able to notice any more than that. It all happened so fast. I use to watch the Finding Bigfoot show a lot, so we spent the rest of the car ride asking questions, explaining observations and possibilities. The location as described below was from a lot of parked cars surrounded by trees on the north side of the road to the south side of the road along the west side of the old farm house heading towards the big fields in the back. From my perspective I was able to see the figure because of the on-coming cars headlights. It was a black shadowy human like figure. I could see 2 humanoid legs for certain and it definitely wasn't a deer or anything on all fours. It seemed to be rather tall, but I didn't see any more than legs and body. If the car coming my way had been a truck I might have seen more. I believe it made it across the road in 3 steps judging by what the first 2 steps looked like. It seemed like it was sprinting very fast. Because it was dark out and we were driving 55 MPH, in the snap of a finger it was gone. We did not stop and investigate. Upon driving through area the next day, I noticed a 5-6 foot ditch on the south side of the road and figured out that's why it had to be sprinting so fast so it could jump over the embankment."
59078,Report 59078: Possible track lines and vocalizations found in a rural neighborhood outside St. Clairsville,Class B,2018-01-21T12:00:00Z,40.10975,-80.85938,2018,Ohio,59078.0,"In mid September 2017 at approximately 1:00 am while taking a small dog out I heard a scream that sounded as if a woman was in some kind of trouble. It was very loud and blood curdling. At the same time, I had a larger dog in the yard, and as she heard the scream immediately ran out of the yard and wanted inside. I did not stay out and went back to bed. I live in a rural area three miles outside of St. Clairsville Ohio, with plenty of homes, but also a significant amount of hilly wooded area with creeks nearby. The sound came from an area that is very woody and hilly situated below my house towards the town of Barton, Ohio. Behind me is about 120 acres of open space that has homes on it. Each lot is five acres and borders the hilly wood area. The homes have all been built in the last five years and for 30 years the property was used for corn and hay. There is an abundance of deer in the area, as I have counted 30 in one viewing. Also, the area has turkeys, but around September, I noticed that they were not around. I once counted upwards of 60 turkeys in one sighting. Also, coyotes are frequent and their barking can be heard often. A couple of days or so later, as my wife and I were taking a drive, she told me that she had taken the dog out at about 1:30 am, she heard the most god awful scream that scared her. She said that when she got back to bed, she could not fall asleep as the scream bothered her so much. She did not wake me as we both worked the next morning. I told her that I had also experienced the same thing the night before. In mid October while sitting around a fire in my back yard with two other couples with music playing, I heard a faint howl. I asked the other couple if they believed in Bigfoot and my friend said he thought they might exist. My wife and relayed our stories of the screams. At that point, I asked my friend to come up on the deck. I had kept two 4 by 4's on the deck and I did three knocks. Within 30 seconds, we heard two and one half howls. The last howl stopped half way through. My friend's comment was ""that was not human"" The friends stayed another half an hour or so and I stayed out. Over the next 45 minutes, I heard an additional three howls. Over the course of the next three months, I did knocks every week, but heard no responses. Over the past, I had occasionally heard other sounds from the woods, but thought nothing of them. On January 20, 2018 as I took my dogs for morning walk around 10 am, there was snow on the ground for a few days, five or six inches and it was starting to melt. Within 50 yards or so of my normal walk area, I noticed tracks in the snow that I had not seen before. The tracks were headed to a nearby neighbor's residence who always has corn out for the deer. The tracks were rather deep in the snow and had just began to melt. I could see two different sets of tracks, one larger, the other slightly smaller. I could also very clearly see what I thought was more like ""footprints"". There were deer tracks also in the area. At that point, I felt fairly sure that they were from a bigfoot. The tracks appeared to be three toes and were distinct. I did take several pictures on my phone. After walking the dogs, I did a Google search on three toe bigfoot tracks and found it was possible. My son was home visiting, he lives in Atlanta and we went back out to the prints. The snow had melted a bit more and I could now see more than three toes and was able to see five in some prints. My son was in awe and he agreed that they were not human, deer or bear. The tracks were primarily in front of each other and the two separate animals had walked fairly close to each other. We took more pictures. My son wears size 17 shoes and the prints were larger than his shoes. We took a picture as comparison. We were able to trace the prints back and the prints came out of the woods, went through the vacant grassy lot. All told I would guess we saw 300 yards of prints. During the previous night, I slept in a room that overlooks the area. The room has plenty of windows and my dog was sleeping in front of one of them. At 4:30 am, she started growling and growled for 45 minutes. She did not bark, but she did wake me up with the continuous growling. The next day, my son went into the wooded area and did find a couple of tracks in the muddy area that showed two prints similar to what we saw in the snow. He did take pictures. That night, we did a few knocks around 8 pm, but no responses. Additionally, on February 13, within 20 yards of the January prints, I found two sets of prints again after a 7 inch snow fall. I am comfortable stating that there were two sets of prints and I could see toes in them. They came within 20 yards of my fence and then circled back. My wife and I do discard bread, apple peels into that area from time to time to find the deer. In summary, I have watched enough Bigfoot TV shows, read enough about them to feel comfortable with what I have heard and seen. Although, I am no expert, I have not been able to humanly explain the events. Additionally, I am well educated and have been an executive in banking for 40 years."
63140,Report 63140: Multiple encounters near an old strip mine just outside of Harrisville.,Class B,2020-02-06T12:00:00Z,40.16912,-80.62003,2020,West Virginia,63140.0,"I had two experience's with what I believe to be the Grassman in 2007. The first encounter happened on a strip pond. We took a boat back to a spot along the high wall to where there was a flat spot to camp. We set up camp, fished, cooked, and then went to bed around 11 PM. At approximately 4 AM, I was awaken to heavy footsteps walking down over the near vertical high wall. It approached the tent and I heard heavy raspy breathing. After a few seconds, I cleared my throat. Then to my amazement, it cleared its throat mimicking me. At that point I started screaming I had a gun. My friend would not wake up for some reason. I finally calmed down some and could hear it walk down to the water. Once there, I could hear it sipping water out of its hands. After that, it walked back to the tent, sat for a minute then walked back up the hill. The next morning we found 18 inch tracks right on the edge of the reeds. About two weeks later, we were walking to a boat that was on a pond about a quarter mile away. Then, I saw what looked to be a ten foot stump with two eyes watching us. I told my friend and he blew it off as just a tree. So we went out on the pond and after a while we smelled a strong wet dog and feces smell. After that, we started to get scared so we went back to the spot where the boat was kept. We looked for the giant stump that we had seen earlier but could not find it."

We backed our truck up to the water, dropped the tailgate, built a fire and started fishing. This was around 9pm. The moon was so full we didn't need a lantern. It was very still and quiet out until we heard a few coyote's howl followed by some frogs croaking. Across the creek was thick with brush and small trees, there was a path that looked like led down to the water. While sitting on tailgate, we started to hear a sound of something walking down the side of the creek. You could hear it slowly taking what sounded like a two beat step. Too heavy for a deer, and too small for a coyote/cat. It hesitated at the pathway, then continued on to the left of us. It then made a loop to the right and came back up only farther away from the bank. Then we heard a hoot owl like sound very close to where we first heard the brush cracking. Then another hoot farther to the right as we could hear the footsteps fade in the distance. Then, about 5 minutes later, we heard a tree fall to the right of us across the creek where we heard the footsteps and hoot sounds. After all this the frogs started croaking again. We fished a little longer and decided it was time to leave."
65393,Report 65393: Possible knock heard from Little Miami Bike Trail near Ft. Ancient,Class B,2020-04-12T12:00:00Z,39.42606,-84.10463,2020,Ohio,65393.0,"I was on the Little Miami Bike Trail heading back to Morrow from Oregonia...mile marker 23.5. It was Sunday, April 12, around 5:00 in the afternoon. Since the Covid restrictions were enacted a week or two prior, the trail had became so crowded every day of the week. However a cold front came in and it was a cool, cloudy day and very few people on the trail...maybe 15 to 20 riders encountered from Oregonia to Kings Mill...well, maybe more, but not bad. I'm retired and ride this route nearly day, weather permitting. So, after passing under the former Jeremiah Morrow Bridge (I-71 over Little Miami river) there's a long gentle arc in the trail. I haven't seen a soul since I turned around at Wilmington Rd. I'm cruising, it's nice and quiet, when suddenly I heard a loud knock...so distinct I instantly said in my head...that was a knock! It came from atop the hill to the east. I pondered all the conditions, i.e; kids playing..not!, cold, remote, and they don't play in woods anymore,..adult messing...maybe, but how would they know I was there?... natural, very doubtful, I'm nearly 68 and never heard anything so crisp, clearly, like a Louisville slugger full speed against a barkless solid ash tree (I imagined). There...that's what happened. I look online to see if any Bigfoot sightings had been reported in this area and found none. I stored the incident away until last weekend when I was talking to my son. He's 46 in May, I raised him near Morrow (abutting the former Frisch's Farm on the 3-C highway). Our school district includes the Maineville area. One of his good friends lived on a hillside, at a 90 degree curve on Sibcy Rd. His friend, Chris Flick's older brother told Nick, 20 years ago, he and his dad both saw a Bigfoot walking through the woods on the opposing (their house) hillside...two different times. Nick said he never related this until he told me...because of my knock story. He said he'll never forget it...and because of his story, I tell you my story...There! Thanks for reading, and hopefully you consider. Dan"

We were scouting for deer on an abandoned farm in an area that had been stripped for coal 35yrs prior. Deer were plentiful, but not as much as present day. When came across it when we both were following a path that materialized and split in two directions around a spoil bank. My brother in law went one way I the other, both paths lead to the top of the spoil were we came on the structure. We were in total amazement noting it was kind of an igloo shape with an opening to enter. The briars where woven together to form the walls and the inside had been cleared like it had been mowed. We stood amazed at what could have made it. We had never heard much about a Bigfoot at that time. Nobody in they’re right mind would have been in the area fighting thorny vegetation and biting insects to create such a thing. Than about a month later the same brother in law and his cousin were walking out of a hollow near dark when they heard the strangest animal they had ever heard. When they would try to tell the family about it they got laughed at. Neither ever forgot it  or entered the property in the dark. It wasn’t until maybe 20 years later when I happened on a Bigfoot program showing such a structure that a bell went off as to what we’d saw. Also around the time other people had reported seeing things peeking in windows around the county"
69411,Report 69411: Long distance daylight sighting by farm owner 5 miles south of Ashland,Class B,2021-06-09T12:00:00Z,40.81139,-82.26806,2021,Ohio,69411.0,"The incident occurred on June 9, 2021 at approximately 5:15pm. It started raining around 3:30pm and ended around 5pm. I had to get the grass mowed because it was already too long. Usually, when I mow, I have my cellphone in my shirt pocket. But, since it rained, I didn’t want to take the chance of it getting wet. So, I left it in the house. I was mowing in the direction of north to south. There are several large farm fields behind my house. In between these properties are three large depressions in the landscape where a large vehicle could park in there and no one would see it. Through these particular spots are cart paths that run along the bottom (also running from north to south). As I was mowing, a dark figure appeared down by the corner of one of the fields, approximately150-200 yards out. I stopped and looked and was wondering if it was the neighbor checking his trail cam that points to the north. I took my mower over to the wood pile which is approximately 35 yards closer, to get a better view. The field was just planted with soybeans, so I couldn’t go in the field with the mower. At that point, the dark figure was just east of the trail cam and I was hoping it would cross the path of the trail cam, but it seemed to avoid that area. This dark figure was following the deer trail that are 40 yards east of the trail cam. I asked myself, “What am I looking at?” knowing it had just rained. Who would be back there?” I idled the mower down and noticed the toadstools around the wood pile and thought maybe it was a mushroom hunter. But, this “person” was black from head to toe and mushroom season is basically over by now. This large figure started to move across the second field heading northeast along where the deer usually go, down into the large depression in the field. As it was moving across the field, I knew there was no way I would have enough time to get my cell phone or binoculars in time to view it.  I sat there and observed it following the deer trail...knowing it was not a black bear walking on two legs. The whole time I was thinking, “No one is going to believe me”. It seemed to cross the field without any trouble and cleared the field within a matter of a minute and a half. As it disappeared into the chest-high weeds, I sat there for approximately five minutes waiting to see if it would appear on the other side or head toward the large section of woods which have several trail cams along the perimeter of the woods. I also scanned the treeline for any vehicles that might be there from someone out walking, but there weren’t any. I could not figure out what I had just seen. I finished mowing and didn’t even tell my wife about it until a few days later. At my first opportunity, on June 12th we took our golf cart back into the area to see if we could find any prints or tracks. To our disappointment, the field had been no-tilled (Roundup) where the field was filled with weeds, grass, and corn stalks where it made it very hard to find footprints. We also followed the path that it took up to the large part of the depression in the field where you can see game trail going in and out of chest-high weeds. We also took the cart down into the lower part of the depression via the mowed paths that are back there. On June 13th, we conducted a re-enactment with our 15 year-old son. He is about 5’11” and 235 lbs. We had him dress in a black Adidas sweatsuit that had white lettering and stripes on it. My wife took him on the golf cart to the area where I saw the black figure. I sat back at the wood pile on my mower to watch for him. Through cell phone conversations with my son, I had him put up his hood and walk the same path, three quarters of the way through the field, all in black. My first observation was that what I saw on June 9th was much bigger and moved through the field easier than my son did. He was trying not to walk on the newly planted soybeans and trying to miss the old corn stalks in the field. Because of this it took my son longer to cross the field. He was close enough that I could actually see the white parts of my son's sweat suit with no problem. Because of that, I know that what I saw was all black. Note in May, we saw less deer in the area possibly due to the farmer tiling the field. And for the month of June, we have taken cart rides and have seen less deer in the area. I haven’t told too many people for fear of being made fun of. My wife didn’t really believe me until we did the re-enactment. She even says that there is no way you could miss something all black from head to toe back there. I just can’t seem shake it from my mind."

We own the better part of mystic woods in Columbiana OH. When the gas and oil companies started installing pipelines years back we started having encounters. I’m an engineer by trade and my wife is a banker. Tonight yet another sighting by our pond.  My wife and I were at dinner and as we arrived home about 8:30 PM a very large fast gray/ silver lite brown (covered in fur/hair) bigfoot darted from bushes in our front into the cat tails in our pond on all fours. We both looked at each other and said did you just see that?!!  The subject was down low and bent in the middle as it moved. Unlike a dog, it’s undulating movement was not as fluid as a dog. It was not a bear. It appeared to be from 4-5 feet at the back and torso built like a barrel. When it went into the cattails we were no longer able to see it."

On the 23rd of July, Jim Thompson BFRO Investigator of Ohio had contacted me and came out to investigate. During Jim's first visit he found four more footprints near the original footprint. Jim stated that the other footprints were about four feet spread apart from each other. On July 24th at approximately 12:38 A.M. I heard a sort of yelping noise coming from one end of my property and heard a quick response (same type of noise) come from the other end of my property. At night time every now and then on my property I get an eerie feeling that something is watching me."

South of Johnson but north of Wall Rd. I immediately went inside and began to search the internet for similar audio examples of what I heard, for comparison purposes. I located sounds on the internet of alleged Bigfoot that were eerily similar to the sounds I heard on August 14, 2021."
71751,Report 71751: Possible sighting in Mohican State Park near Loudonville,Class B,2021-06-18T12:00:00Z,40.61309,-82.31692,2021,Ohio,71751.0,"It was June 18th, 2021 about 4:00 pm at Mohican State Park, Loudonville, Ohio in Ashland County. My best friend and Idrove into the picnic area at the Covered Bridge, and there were no campers, hikers, or people fishing, so we drove into Campsite B, its a narrow road that is parallel to the Mohican River. Then we reached the end of this road where there is a turn-around, so we parked the car and shut off the engine. The front of the car was facing towards the Covered Bridge and the Mohican River was on the driverside of the car, and the thick woods were on the passenger's (my side) and to the rear of us. Also, it was an unusually chilly day for the month of June and it was very cloudy, with no sun and a slight drizzle of rain. So, we sat in the car with the windows down, we could hear birds chirping and the soft babbling sounds of the river. We sat there for about 30 minutes, talking away as women do and I mentioned that I watched a Bigfoot show on tv and we should do ""bigfoot calls"". So, jokingly I started doing whoop whoop calls and it echoed in this small area, we laughed for a couple of minutes then took a drink of our pop and we heard two tree knocks, not loud but not soft. Instantly, I was scared because the sound was very close to us, it was about 30 feet up in the thick woods, and it was very steep, almost straight-up. I knew this was not a person because it's too dangerous to climb. This spooked both of us so we started the car and went back to the Covered Bridge picnic area which is more of an open area. Also, there were a few cars so we did not feel alone, and my friend had to use the restroom and I stayed in the car. The woods were still on my right side and I could hear birds chirping loud and fast then all of a sudden they stopped. Then a rock that was about 6 inches wide came tumbling down on the ground of this steep cliff along with dry leaves falling behind it. So I looked up and about 15-20 feet away I saw the left side of a foot, calf, thigh, and hip of an animal. It looked like it was slipping on the leaves and was trying to gain traction and its leg went straight up and behind a tree. This leg looked like a bodybuilder's leg with short black hair and was about 3-4 feet in length. Then my friend got into the driver's side of the car and we left. So, when I got home I looked up videos on youtube of bears. My leg sighting does not match a bear leg because the hind leg of a bear or dog has an odd angle from the pad of the foot to its leg. But what I saw was a human-like foot with hair that connected to a calf, to a knee, to a thigh then to a hip, and it was super muscular. Also, there have been NO bear sightings in Mohican State Park for many decades."

As I slowed down near bike path crossing, we looked out the passenger side of the car and saw a large black figure standing [a distance] up the bike path, facing the river, while it was snowing. The ground was covered with at least three inches of snow so it didn't appear that someone would be on the bike path biking or walking the trail. The weather was not ideal for anyone to be hunting or walking on the path at that time. The figure appeared to have come from the woods and was walking toward the river. It was difficult to estimate the size of the figure when they saw it. It didn’t appear to be a hunter as they would have been wearing an orange vest, or at least an obvious clothing pattern."

At 3:39 we all woke up due to the sound of something knocking a tree behind us. Was in the distance but close enough to make you on edge. We thought it was a woodpecker and brushed it aside. 10 minutes later we heard the noise on our right side of the tent. The knocking was in triples such as “ knock, knock, knock” then a pause and the 3 knocks again, but in every direction the knocking had a slight variation. The knocking was coming from all sides of our tent, as if there was something surrounding us communicating. Knocks has slight variations in how quick they were, but all of them had the triple knocking. The closest knock was about 50 yard uphill from us. The close one made everything stop in the woods, it was raining and it stopped along with the wind. This is weird  considering it was super windy up there the whole time we stayed, except that one moment. We all agreed to not camp that spot again."

The tree was approximately  2 or 3 inches in diameter and absolutely no strong winds to push it over the whole week while I was hunting.  I do know that it was standing and not pushed over the day before. Seemed strange but continued to harness up and climb into my deer stand.  Still being very dark that morning I nocked an arrow and settled in to my stand.  Approximately 15 minutes after I shut my headlamp off,  I heard a distinct knock on a tree about 100 yards or so from my tree stand deep in the woods.  It sounded like someone hitting a large stick or baseball bat against a tree.   It knocked about 4 times then stopped and a few minutes later it knocked two times.  It was the strangest thing I have ever heard and the first time I have ever experienced it.  I know that nothing could have made that sound other than a person.  I’ve been an avid hunter all my life and have been in the woods many times, but never before have I heard anything like it, and hope I never do again."

It had rained all day and had gone to drizzle by the time we arrived at our cabin around 4:30 pm. We unlocked the cabin and went inside and looked around and then went out right before 5 to start unloading our SUV. My wife grabbed some items and headed inside. Right as she got inside I heard a siren go off in the area of Beavers Bend State Park to warn about water being released from the dam. Immediately I heard a load deep growl. After a few seconds the growl turned into a deep howl. This went on for about thirty seconds and was immediately followed by a loud high pitched scream. This was followed wooooing sounds that lasted about 2 minutes. My wife came out while this was going on. We didn't discuss it as I didn't want to tell her what all I had heard. We grabbed up some items and went into the cabin. Upon coming back outside the sound was gone. I heard the siren go off many more times while we were there but never heard any other sounds. I am an army veteran and also former scoutmaster and have spent a lot of time in the woods but have never heard a combination of sounds like this. I'm still not certain if this actually was one or a coincidence of several animal calls occurring one after the other. My wife thought the woooing sound was wind blowing in the forest when we discussed this after we got home. But at the time there was little to no wind blowing and we never heard that again although it blew quite a bit as it rained the majority of time we were there. I originally sent this sound combination to Cliff Barackman and mentioned the Ohio howl and after looking it up it did sound similar to that. At the time I hadn't really thought much about Bigfoot since back when I was in junior high in the 1970's but after this have become really interested in it after this."

It didn’t appear to go straight across, more at a diagonal from right to left with right being the farthest point left being the closest. When I first picked it up in my sight, because of the coloration, my brain said dog. By the time it was out of sight, I realized it was on two feet. It happened in a few seconds. It went across the highway very fast. I was late to my destination so I just slowed down in the area to look. Once I got to where I was going and unloaded my gear I went back and spent about an hour walking up and down both sides of the highway to see if there were any tracks to indicate what I had seen. While doing this a person stopped to see if I was having trouble and needed assistance. When I told him what I was doing his response was “yeah you get a lot of that here.”"

Our Yurt sits directly on the Mountain Fork River. We stayed up until midnight and headed to bed. Around 2 am we woke to the sound of 6 or 7 consecutive howls over a 3 minute time span. It was very loud and east of our yurt. It was then silent. 30 minutes later we heard 3 loud hollering vocalizations much closer in the other direction, to the west of us. We have spent a lot of time in the woods. This is a sound we’ve never heard before. It was not a bear growl. It was not a coyote or a bobcat. This was loud."

Hunting fishing as a teen I would camp alone with my squirrel dog. The only time I've heard anything like it was on TV during the big foot shows. I wasn't going to make a report but while reading some of the reports. I came across repot #34657. In early summer 2007 I was headed north from Big Cedar on 259 and saw a tall dark figure cross the hwy about 1/2 mile ahead of me. It was one solid dark color from head to feet. Bipedal with long arms. Extremely dark brown to black. In almost the exact same place as seen in report #34657. Time was around 10 am.

The woods were very quiet and only one guy on a 4 wheeler came past me and then again leaving much earlier that day. Just at dusk I heard a yell like no other animal I have ever heard about a quarter mile south. It lasted about 10 seconds. A minute or two later it happened again only louder. The hair stood up on the back of my neck. About 5 minutes later another yell comes about a quarter mile north of me only this time its 3 times louder. It yelled 5 separate times with about 10 seconds between each 10 second long yell. These yells were much stronger of a voice than the first two yells. About 2 minutes later the first yeller did it again only it sounded like it was further south. I don't believe a human could be as loud as this was at a distance and the voice was far too big. I was scared to death and spent the night with my gun in my hand laying frozen in my completely dark tent trailer. I was afraid to turn any lights on just pretended to be asleep. At 4:30 am the first log truck went by  followed by several others so I felt safe again."

I got out of the truck and no sooner got to the back by the tailgate and whatever this was sounded off with a loud whoop sound. We all started walking to the tree line. My son decided to do a whoop sound just goofing off and we got a louder whoop sound back that's where it all started. The whoop sounds got louder in front of us and started from the left, the middle, farther away in the middle and to the right of us. It lasted for several minutes. My wife and son had there phones recording also. We have it recorded. I have been hunting these woods for over 20 years. I know what bear, coyote, cattle, cougars, birds etc sound like. This is not even close of anything I have ever heard. A couple days prior to that my wife mentioned a really foul strong smell. My oldest son said he heard what sounded like someone hitting a tree with a stick like knocks. the video says it all. I also know we were the only people in that area at the time."

I walked into a small opening on a rise. I just happened to lookout across the drainage and I noticed the outline of what looked like a person. But way out of proportion. I called for my friend to come over and look at what I was seeing. I'm old and the vision is not what it used to be. I wasn't sure I was looking at a shadow. But then it moved about two feet to the left. And just stood there and looked strait at us. We watched it still not believing what we were seeing. It was perfectly still. After a minute or two we turned away for about 10-20 seconds turned back around and it was gone. No doubt one hundred percent gone. We were looking at the head shoulders down to mid abdomen. I have worked in the woods from 14 years old. I'm 62 I've seen many black bears brown bears, moose, buffalo, nothing comes close to the size of what we saw. Thanks"

On the morning of the 12th just after 6am I was making coffee when I heard a guttural growling that rose to a higher pitch scream and then became a whooping sound, after which it dropped back down to a growl.  This sequence repeated three times.  My dog freaked out barking, but would not go past the saplings on the east edge of the camp, which is strange because he usually pursues deer, elk, and bears several hundred yards into the woods. I grabbed my bow and walked past the line of saplings, into an open forest that sloped down to a ravine with areas of dense vegetation.  I called my dog to follow, but he would not come.  The forest in this area is full of downed trees, where my sons and I had gathered firewood the previous afternoon.  I believe the sound came from the vegetation / trees at the bottom of the ravine, which we had been within 30 feet of when gathering downed wood. I only walked about 20 feet past the saplings, and stood on a log for a better view, but did not see anything moving.  I then decided to go back to camp, being a bit worried because my dog wouldn’t leave the area of our tent.  For the next hour and a half I sat with my bow next to me, the dog sitting between my legs, and listened to many instances of downed branches cracking beyond the saplings.  When the cracks stopped, it was abruptly, not fading as if the cause were moving away.  These were large branches being broken, similar to the sound of a bear breaking wood.  My dog is not afraid of bears and has chased away several, including one the previous week in eastern Idaho. About half an hour after the cracking sounds stopped the dog went out in the forest to investigate, and everything seemed to return to normal.  It was then that I again heard the squirrels angrily chirping and chittering at the dog, and realized that I had not heard it at all during the noises or cracking. I have never heard anything in the Blue Mountains, Rockies, or Cascades like this sound.  It sounded nothing like deer, elk, moose, bear, mountain lion, or bobcat.  The only thing I could possibly think is maybe a mountain lion was killing an elk, but it repeated three times with just about the same length and cadence.  And the whooping part of it reminded me of those plastic bellows hoses that you swing in the air to make a whistling / whooping sound. While in Pendleton a couple days later I was describing the sounds to a local hunter when an older native woman overheard and said she thinks it was a Bigfoot, and that she’s heard them on the Umatilla Reservation."

I will try to keep it simple. I had recently purchased a used vehicle and we decided to take it for a test drive to Laverne Park, which is just a short drive into the mountains from where we live. I was with my girlfriend, her 14 year old daughter, and my dog. After passing the park, we drove on further to see the country. We found a right turn and followed the rural road up into the forest. I later found out that we were traveling up Moon Creek. Not long after heading up the road, my car started overheating. I didn't have water on me so I decided to stop at the first water source, which was a bridge of the creek. I pulled over and we got out. While stepping out of the truck by girlfriend said, "" hey, there is something walking on the hill above us"". We stopped and listened for a moment but it was quiet. I then looked for a place to collect some water from the creek but it turned out that the edge of the water was too steep to step down and get water from. So, I had come up with a quick plan to connect some string to a cup and ""fish"" the water from the bridge. While we were trying to get the cup to fill, a small stone was thrown at us and bounced on the concrete of the bridge we were on. I looked up and noticed a steep hillside above us wondering what the hell could throw a rock at us. I noticed my dog was sitting in my truck, which she never does while I'm out of it in the wilderness. I was getting a little spooked so I tried to speed up the process of getting the water in the cup. Then, another stone bounced on the bridge next to us. I literally watched it skip along the cement. I mentioned that we better hurry, and then, from somewhere up the hill, came a very large rock, about the size of a softball of larger. It smashed against a huge rock in the creek and busted into pieces. I stood up on the bridge, looked at my girlfriends daughter and said, ""let's go now!"" My girlfriend and dog were already in the truck when I slammed the hood down and dove inside. We drove down the mountain and pulled over. I had left so fast that I didn't put the radiator cap back on. I considered returning after getting water to try to get pictures, but my girlfriend wouldn't let us go back. Now, either somebody was on that steep hill in the middle of the forest screwing with us and throwing rocks, or something else was. If it was a person, they are mighty brave in a forest full of hunters and guns. I don't know, seems awful strange."

I saw three strides and it was across the road and the fourth step took it up a 7 foot bank. The fur appeared to be long and very dark, almost black but with a bit of a sheen to it. The fur appeared to go all the way to the ground around the feet. Because I was approaching the bottom of the dip, my headlights were only catching the very bottom of where the road came back up and he was at the very top of my headlight beams. I backed up and pulled out a light, looked for tracks through my car window. even though I am an experienced hunter and tracker, I felt goose bumps and the hair on the back of my neck was standing up and I left after I locked the doors. I've seen many bears, three mountain lions, a fisher and many other wild animals in many areas. This was not a four legged creature."

He described the color as a uniform black. With no distinguishing clothing. The size he said was at least his size maybe bigger. my uncles is 6'4"" and 250 pounds and he even said it was the size that caught his eye. We can't think of any reason a person would try to traverse such a steep incline or even going to the top of the hill cause there is nothing but woods once u reach the top. My uncle said it was spooky because he couldn't think of any reason either. I laughed and jokingly said it was bigfoot and with that my uncle started rambling about even if it was.

Was about 11:30 at night, and I had some music playing low on a small Bluetooth speaker. From way deep in the valley below me, and I mean it’s a huge expanse of woods back there, a couple miles to the next road, I heard a bone chilling ethereal howl.  Then I heard it again. Turned my music off, and listened intently.  I heard it three more times over the next minute or so. Too faint to record but loud enough to hear beside a crackling pine fire.  Each instance was three or five seconds long, sounded “WHOOOOHRRRLL”.  Started soft, picked up in intensity, then tailed off.  Whatever it was it was very loud, very powerful, almost resonated like a train whistle does from a distance.  I could also tell the sound was projected in different directions on a couple of the howls. I have spent a lot of time in the woods in my life. I'm an avid hunter, and an all around outdoorsman.  I'm familiar with the animals that live here in PA and I know I didn't hear one of them.  I know what barred owls sound like, coyotes, dogs, people... Pretty sure this was none of those. Whatever made that sound was large and powerful.  It stood the hairs on my neck. I sat listening for another half hour or so and didn't hear it again.  That's when my mind got to wandering.  I spent pretty much the entire next day (Easter Sunday) listening to recordings on YouTube and the like and a few sounded a lot like what I heard.  A supposed bigfoot recording from Westmoreland County PA and the 1994 Ohio Howl in particular were eerily similar.  What I heard was slightly higher in pitch than the Ohio sounds, but almost identical in tone change, cadence and duration.

But within minutes we all heard the 2nd knock and were all speechless in what we had just heard. After talking about it for a couple minutes we heard another but this time it came from the other side of the river, speechless yet again we all just looked at each other and within seconds we heard another but this time it was right being us and close. That's when we knew we had to leave.  As we were packing our fishing poles in the car we heard 4 loud aggressive knocks within 30 yards of were we parked.

I was camping with my sons’ troop in Moraine State Park in Butler County, PA.  I woke up in the middle of the night.  I want to say it was around midnight, but cannot be sure.  This would have been a Friday night into Saturday morning. I was taken back by how quiet the woods were.  Being a seasoned tent camper, this struck me as odd.  Our tent was the closest to the shore line, maybe 30 or 40 yards of woods in between us and the shore.  The deep woods were on the other side of a trail road from our tent site. Up the shore line I heard what sounded like a tree or rock knock.  The knock continued for a little bit and was eventually answered by other tree knocks coming from two distinct locations in the deep woods.  The answered calls seemed pretty far in the distance but still auditable.  The original knock came from our side of the shore and was closer than the other two.  This happened for a little while, the answering calls never changed, but the knock on our side kept getting closer to our tent site. I was actually astonished at how fast the knocks where moving down the shore line.  By that I mean, the knock source closest to us was coming toward our camp site, working its way down the shore line.  Whatever was making the knocks was moving at a good speed for being in the woods at night. Then the knocks stopped right when it felt like the source was directly behind us. The following night was Saturday. I woke up again, but this time the woods were their normal sounding self and there was boat life on the lake.  I did hear another knock, fairly distance in the woods, but that was the only one."

The tracks were similar to human tracks, but different. The thing that was most apparent to me was the distance between the foot prints, which approximately 4' apart. There were no shoe treads in the tracks.  I believe the tracks were made sometime after 11pm and 3-5am, because I was outside until around 11pm.  Then I was up around 6am but it was dark at that time. I didn't see them until it was light. The tracks had fresh snow inside the tracks indicating they were several hours old.

They have beautiful pastures and a huge assortment of farm life - from turkeys to quail to goats and llamas donkeys and horses.  Their fields run right up to the forest, probably not even a football fields length away. I was sitting outside watching their antics and enjoying the evening air.  Suddenly, something started to howl in the woods to the west. Everything alive on the place froze in that same moment and all of their heads - mine included- swiveled toward the sound. I cannot begin to describe it, but I had grown up in these hills and know it was nothing I could identify.  The sound was somewhere between a howl and a scream and just echoed. It went on for 3-5 minutes, and every creature stopped to listen. I didn’t hear it again while there. I didn’t tell the proprietor when I saw him next. Since then, I’ve listened to recordings to try and identify the sound and the recent recording by the hunter out of Canada is an exact match. That’s what impelled me to report it."

We drove there in the early afternoon and decided to try to walk one or two of the trails in the park.  We took our two dogs with us as they love to hike, and if no one else is near us, we let them off leash so they can run up and down the trail.  Today was different.  The dogs never got more than a couple of yards from us and seemed stressed.  We thought their conduct was odd, but credited their behavior to the fact that they had not been out much since we just moved.   We started along the Interpretive Trail loop near the Old Mac Trail head.  We were enjoying ourselves as there was no one else on the trail.  We stopped next to a creek and I thought I heard a single knock, like someone hitting a bat against a tree.  I asked my wife if she heard it and she confirmed she heard the noise as well.  We thought maybe it came from hikers up ahead.  We walked along a little farther and heard what sounded like a tree fall in the distance behind us.  There was a little wind, and we have heard trees fall in the woods before, so we continued walking thinking nothing of it. We finished the Interpretive Trail Loop and decided to try another trail, this one called the Judge Branch Trail.  This trail parallels a creek and so we were just walking enjoying the woods when we came upon a muddy area with a lot of deer tracks. I used to hunt in my youth and love trying to discern what animals are doing or where they are going by their tracks.  It seemed to me that two or more deer had been fighting or struggling in the area right off the trail, you could see various hoof prints going in different directions and the ground was torn up.  Looking for more signs we came upon the footprint that was in much more solid ground.  My wife (who is a skeptic) agreed with me that it looked like a large bare footprint and you could definitely see what might be a big toe and maybe indentions of smaller toes.  The print was off the trail and was perpendicular to the trail. There were some leaves and small sticks on top of the imprint which makes me think that it was an older print.  I weigh more than 280lbs and my shoes did not leave marks next to the print which was about a quarter to half inch in depth.  Not too long after this the dogs seemed to become more fearful, and my wife felt the hairs on the back of her neck raise up.   She felt uncomfortable and so we decided to end the hike and head back to the car.  We decided to put the leashes back on the dogs and they pulled hard towards the car.  When they got to the parking lot they once more became relaxed and calm. Also, I could find no other tracks, but we did not venture far off the trail either.  I am not familiar with bears but could this have been a bear track?  I would love to know."

I had my wife and 2 daughters. As I walked I could sense apprehension from my girls and could feel myself. Feeling that this is from their usual fear of bears I continued the walk. As we made our way around the end of the field I looked up to notice a large black creature jump into the wood line. I looked back at my wife and the words I spoke were “That was big” ...   I keep wanting to say it was a wild boar or maybe even bear. That would be fine but it walked on 2 legs and had a backside of a human or ape. And also moved like a bipedal creature."

I stopped by the park on my way home to try out some new camping equipment.  There are two entrances to the park; the main entrance off of Hwy 16 and the one I like because it's more wooded off of Applewhite Rd. Some new trails are being made because of some flooding that occurred in the area last year so there are some trees that have been cut down. One of these trails has a wooden fence with a ""No Trespassing"" sign on it. I ignored the sign and made my way to the river. I made a small fire and began fishing. While I was fishing I started to hear loud banging. I turned around to see if i could see what was making the noise but saw no one. We do have Woodpeckers but this was no woodpecker. I thought nothing of it and continued fishing. A few minutes went by and I heard a loud moan. Like a wail. Again, I turned to look around and saw no one. I started thinking, ""Okay, someone has got to be messing with me."" I kept on fishing when out of the corner of my eye something moved and I heard a very loud splash. I did not see what was thrown into the water near me but it was big. A big rock or log is my guess. It made a giant ""SPLOOSH"". Something threw a BIG something in the water. After that I packed up and made my way back up to the trail. On my way back I heard the wood knocking again and I attempted to reply. I followed the three knocks I heard with three of my own. No reply. The whole time I walked back to my truck I had the feeling I was being watched. I stopped and looked around but saw no one. If someone was there they were well hidden and light on their feet because I didn't even hear footsteps. The area is wooded and there are leaves and branches everywhere so I'm sure I would have heard twigs snapping or leaves rustling if someone was there. When I got back to my truck I saw a jogger and his Lab going for a drink from the broken water fountain. I offered the man some bottled water for him and his dog. He thanked me and I took the opportunity to ask him if he had heard the same knocking or banging I had. He had. He said he and his dog stopped to listen but couldn't figure out where it was coming from. The road/highway divides the park. This man was on one side and I was on the other. This part of the highway doesn't get a lot of traffic so it wasn't traffic I heard. One more thing I think you should know is that this area has a legend called The Donkey Lady. All teenagers in San Antonio know of this legend. It is said if you cross her bridge you will hear her ""hooves"" pounding the road and things will be thrown at you. This legend has been around for many many years. After what happened yesterday,  I'm starting to think Donkey Lady Bridge isn't haunted by a ghost but occupied by something real. I'm not convinced Bigfoot exists because I need to see it but my wife believes and she suggested I report it to you guys. We often go hiking on these trails with our children and she likes to point out, facetiously, Bigfoot nests and food sources. We are an outdoorsy family and we live in the country where at night we hear owls and coyotes and know what predators and their prey live in our area and what noises they make. This was none of those animals."

This is not unusual so I did not think much about it.  As I got closer it went to the side of the road (not unusual for ATVs either).  I slowed down because I was approaching what I thought was the ATV and it went into the ditch. As I approached a big black thing stood up lifted up his leg and crossed a log, going into the forest. It had been bent over until I got close to it, I guess. I can not explain what it was. When it crossed the log it disappeared into the forest. I know exactly where it crossed and I have asked my husband to go and look for foot prints. I have never believed in Big Foot but I can tell you this is not anything I have ever seen in my 53 years of life! When I got to work this morning I shared what I had seen with co-workers.

Were were hunting a remote Texas Ranch at night with no light with the exception of a motion activated green light that would shine if an animal walked within 10 yards and 145 degree radius of the light standing 3 feet on a stick in the ground.  We were placed onto our milk carton ""chairs"" behind dead vegetation about 2 feet high and 40 yards from the light placed over a pile of corn placed by the rancher.  We sat down just before dark at 9PM and waited. I wore binoculars and glassed our area before dark to become familiar with the terrain and where the pigs might trail to the corn.  At 200 yards behind us in a brush area, I noted an animal lying down and looking towards us.  It was only a quartering appearance, but I noticed it was eating something.  I could not identify the animal, only movement and a dark hairy head. At midnight, we began to hear bipedal movement to our right about 40 yards away and a light breeze wafted an incredibly terrible smell towards us.  We hear grunting and branch breaking.  Within 20 minutes tree knocking began.  It was rapid 3-5 almost staccato knocks answered almost immediately approximately 75 yards to our left in 2-3 slower knock responses.  Whistling started and my son became very frightened.  The green light went on without any noted animal, so I aimed my .45-70 rifle at the lit ground and fired one round into the dirt near the light.  We then heard 2 sets of bipedal footsteps running away from us to our left over the ridge towards my nephews. The sound of the running was very heavy footfalls of what sounded like large animals.  We called our guide and requested to be picked up, and he arrived 30 minutes later.  My nephews reported hearing the running, and they saw one pair of glowing eyes 8-9 inches apart about 8 feet off the ground 20 yards from their boxed blind, and it scared them.  They also heard tree knocking and whoops.  They had heard my shot and said it correlated with running towards their blind and subsequent observations they made.  They were also frightened."
50643,Report 50643: Camper hears possible wood knock and distant reply in the Sam Houston National Forest,Class B,2016-01-04T12:00:00Z,30.52897,-95.72607,2016,Texas,50643.0,"On Monday, January 4, 2016, at 6 a.m., I was backcountry camping with a friend in the Sam Houston National Forest. We had made camp near an unnamed pond west of the Hiking Trail. The night was clear, 35 degrees, and perfectly still. My friend and I were hammock camping and, because of the cold, were both under low-staked tarps that prevented us from seeing out. Our hammocks were about 15 yards apart. At 6 a.m. it was still completely dark. I had been awake for about 15 minutes but remained in my sleeping bag inside my hammock. At that point I heard a sharp clack perhaps 75 yards on the other side of my friend. Two seconds later I heard a double-knock much farther away, perhaps a ½ mile to the north or northwest. The first pop was crisp and close. To my ears it had to be either rock on rock or wood on wood. As there is nothing in that area but sandy soil and trees, my conclusion was that this was a well-struck tree knock followed by a distant response. To the best of our knowledge there were no other people in the vicinity. We had arrived at the trail head to begin our one-night backpacking trip at 2 p.m. the previous afternoon, and we had only seen one other party of hikers, who passed our camp at 4:30 Sunday afternoon and continued eastward on the trail; we saw no one else during the entire trip, which ended when we arrived back at the parking lot at 11:30 a.m. Monday morning. Had it been windy I could have written the sounds off to cracking limbs, but there was not the slightest breeze, and the two sounds appeared to me to be a clear call and response, perhaps: “Humans over here"" … ""Roger that.” After the sounds, I froze and listened hard for several minutes for any other noise such as footfalls, stick breaks or other evidence of visitors but heard none. Within five minutes I asked my friend if he had heard it and he had not, having his ears covered by his cap and his head inside his sleeping bag at the time. Within 15 minutes we both were asleep again. We awoke for good at about 7:20 a.m. and vacated the area at 10 a.m. We heard distant coyotes, dogs, ducks, and owls, but no other such sounds during our stay. The absence of footfalls or other noises initially made me think it must have not been a sasquatch, but on reflection, the visitor could easily have frozen in his spot when he discovered our camp and then moved slowly away, perhaps using fallen logs, 15 minutes later once we were back to sleep. Considering the stillness of the night, the crisp, unambiguous clack, and the quick double-knock response, I can think of no other cause for these sounds."

A few friends and I were dirt road driving through several very wild and remote parts of our county. We stopped to look and listen. I put my generation one night vision monocular on the edge of a clearing. I noticed a large, black, and roundish shape. I thought it might be a cow but when I focused on it, it stood up slowly on two legs, appeared to be very tall, and took three or four really long, liquid, and smooth steps to get behind a nearby mesquite tree. It appeared to be a huge, man like figure. It appeared to me to be moving slowly to avoid detection, i.e. moving slowly and smoothly with no sudden movements. I tried to zoom in but all I could make out was a huge black shape behind the tree. I was not able to record it and I was the only one in the group who saw it. It's size and the fluidity of its movements are what stuck in my mind the most. It was more coordinated and smoother than even a wild cat. After growing up on a cattle ranch in this part of the country and spending many years as a park ranger, I have seen many wild animals. This was like nothing I have ever seen before. I can't say for sure I saw a Sasquatch but feel strongly that I might have."

The house was an old victorian with a huge S-shaped porch.  It had not been lived in (before me) for 17 years yet, it had been used temporarily as a hunting lodge.  The house was located on the front 40 acres of a large 600 acre piece of property.  This property was bordered in the front, by Hwy 1119 and in the back, by Boggy Creek (the Texas Boggy Creek.)  There was no other house in sight or within a quarter of a mile. I moved there with my two younger children, who were 6 and 8 years old.  They were not accustomed to living in the country.  At night, to the north of us, near where Boggy Creek crossed Hwy 1119, my children and I would hear very loud howls.  They did not sound like a wolf or anything. I am an experienced hunter. The howls sounded more like eery ghosts!  Just after the howling (each time), we'd hear the coyotes start their cackling.  With the howls, my children would say (in the whispering fearful voices), ""what's that Mom?""  I told them I didn't know.  At that time, I never thought of Bigfoot. In the summer of 2000, my children left to visit with their father.  I was all alone on the 600 acres, with my dog Lucy Catahoula/Husky mix) and my 5 cats.It was very quiet with the children gone.  One night my dog Lucy started going crazy with barking and I suddenly heard coyotes all around my house.  I believe they were after my cats.  I ran out into the yard where I had a large bell attached to a pole.  I began ringing the bell and yelling, ""Get out of here!""  I kept yelling as they began to run away.  I continuing with the yelling ""Get out of here"" as I ran around my yard.  Just beyond the light of the porch, at the edge of the darkness near my driveway gate lined with shrubs, I yelled once more.  Something just in front of me, in the total darkness, growled deeply and loudly back at me!  I was completely surprised and the first thing I thought was, ""That's weird, coyotes don't usually growl back at people!""  I wondered why this one was so brave and wasn't running off with the rest of them. Not being a bigfoot follower at that time, it never crossed my mind to be scared.  I responded to the growl with, ""Oh yeah?  I'm going to get my truck!""  I ran into the house, grabbed my keys, and got out into my Ford Ranger.  I backed it up and turned the headlights straight into the shrubs by the driveway.  I saw something that looked gray in color. It turned, jumped right over my barbed wire fence and started running humped over or on all fours, across the tall grass pasture next to my driveway.  I was totally confused on what I might be seeing.  The only detail I could see was that the gray hair on it's back was thin and long, seeing skin underneath, and the hair was somewhat parted down the middle. I backed my truck up and headed out of the driveway to follow this thing.  I drove north on Hwy 1119, paralleling it in the field.  It finally veered off to the right and went further out in the field (towards Boggy Creek) where I could no longer see it.  I kept pondering on what the animal could have been.  Coyotes don't have long hair like that did. Now, I believe it was a sasquatch."

Very deep howls, each lasting 5 to 7 seconds long each, with a small pause between. About 10 seconds later, another howl north west of camp. Higher pitch and feminine sounding. There are no Wolves or Coyotes in this area. Didn't sound like a dog or anything I've ever heard before. The boys, all over 18, were really excited and stood up looking around. They were not believers in Bigfoot, but that got them talking about the possibilities.  About 20 minutes later, while still sitting there, we heard a ""Whoop"" pretty close by. That was the point when they no longer thought i was just a weird Dad who believes in Bigfoot. Through out the night any sound we heard, we all discussed and scrutinized it. Best part of it all. I never spoke of Bigfoot until that point and they were the ones making the connection. The next morning we hiked all around the woods looking for any signs, but found nothing solid. It could have been something else, but from my experiences, it was real. Another big bonus for me is now my son is interested in going out with me, to research and hunt for of forest friend. I feel truly blessed that my son and I, were able to experience this together. And now did doesn't think I'm as crazy anymore. Win win win."

I was going to get my trail camera and check the pictures for any sign of wild hogs moving along the river and eating at the bait I had set up. When I pulled up to the parking area, I was the only truck there. It’s hot in the summer and in those woods there is little breeze. It’s about a 20 min walk through the woods to the camera. So I had navigated my way through the brush and had come around the old piece of original bridge supports and turned slightly north west and something yelled at me about 100 yards away, through the woods. It’s hard to describe the noise. It didn’t taper off, just a blast. I froze, and I don’t know why, but my instinct was to “whoop” at it. I “whooped” and it remained frozen too. I knew where it was but I couldn’t see it through the trees. I raised my rifle to locate whatever it was through the scope. I systematically started searching, and all of a sudden, it tore off through the woods. I saw a glimpse of it through the scope as it took off. What I saw is difficult to explain but you know how a skiers legs look them they are crouched, it was like that, like a spring compressing the knees to unleash power. The sun shone through the trees and I could see the legs had reddish brown fur but was shaggier than a deer. Almost like course hog hair but was soft. Everything about this makes me want to say it was a deer. The fur color, the legs bent, I would even entertain a deer having shaggier fur. But the yell is what makes me know it was something else. It’s yell was intimidating and demanding. It knew I was there and was letting me know it was there. After it ran off, I was filled with a sense of dread and had to talk myself out of not going back to the truck and leaving the camera."

I have lived here 12 years and have had strange things going on at my house since I moved here. But in the last 2 to 3 yrs, things have really started happening more. I live down a dirt road off of hwy 69. There are a lot of woods around me, also have several neighbors around me too. In late summer of 2017, I was jolted awake in the middle of the night by a loud banging on my house. I knew I wasn’t dreaming because I shot straight up; and at that exact moment, my two little dogs flew off my bed barking and carrying on. I stumbled into the kitchen wondering what could be happening and it was 2:38 am. My two big dogs outside were not barking, which I thought was odd. To make a long story short, I called the sheriff's department. Two deputies came out and found nothing. From that moment on, every 2 or 3 months, I have several incidents for a week or two, then nothing for another month or two or three, then things happen again. This past winter from Nov. 2019 to Feb. 2020, I have had several things happen. On three separate occasions while I have been propped in bed watching TV, I have heard a loud growl outside my bedroom loud enough to hear over the TV. It was loud and guttural. I have had tapping on the back of my house during the night. It is usually always around the same time of night. In Jan 2020, I was once again propped up in bed watching TV and over my TV, I heard something rubbing on the back of my house on the wall where my bathroom is. My bedroom and bathroom run together. My two little dogs jumped off the bed into bathroom at the back wall barking. I’ve had rocks thrown at my house.  I’m home alone most of the time. But this past Sat. night, April 18, 2020, my husband happened to be home. Between 11:00 and 11:30 pm, my dog started barking and wouldn’t stop, so I got up to holler at her to hush. As I got to my bedroom door, my cat was laying in my rocking chair next to my door.  I paused to pet her and about that time, I heard that same loud, guttural growl at my back door. My cat heard it, wheeled around, and looked at the back door. I went and woke my husband up. He looked out the back door and saw nothing. I went to the front door and opened it and called my dog. She would not get close to the fence and was barking, looking towards the back of my house towards my neighbor's home behind me. All of a sudden, she jumped back, like whatever it was was coming towards her. I ran to my guest room to look out the window facing that direction; and back towards northwest, I saw something huge and dark in color going across my neighbor's back pasture, moving fast. My neighbor behind me lives alone, and she has had the same things happening at her house. Sent from Yahoo Mail for iPhone"

I was driving on 450 and was slowing down to turn on to Old Avinger Road when I saw something move just behind the first line of trees on my right. It was tall and black, definitely not any of the previously mentioned animals. The deep black color is what made it stand out to me because although the area is wooded it was sunny out and the black color looked out of place with all the other shadows. It's size and color made it stick out. When I slowed to look more it ran into the wooded area fast, not on 4 legs. It was definitely upright and on 2 thick legs. I couldn't see its entire body. What I saw was at least 5 to 6 feet above the edge of the road, and the ground were it was standing is 2 to 3 feet lower than the road. Took me a minute to process what I saw and go through all the wildlife possibilities, but based on the size, shape and speed I don't think it was any of the native wildlife we know of."
72276,Report 72276: Couple describes sasquatch incidents around rural home 22 miles south of Longview,Class B,2022-03-04T12:00:00Z,32.19417,-94.70779,2022,Texas,72276.0,"I’ll explain our most recent encounter below, but first I’ll tell some additional things that have been heard around where we live. My wife and I live in a rural area in East Texas about 10- 15 minutes from a town of about 13-14K people [Henderson]. My wife and I have heard howls on 2 different occasions. Once together about a year and a half ago. It was in the afternoon about 4 or 5 P.M. sitting outside with our dogs. Classic Bigfoot howl that sounded a good ways off. She also heard another howl about a year ago at a different property about 3 or 4 miles down the road. Her father and herself were loading up a hog in a hog trailer and she heard the same howl that we had heard together a few months before, but much louder and closer. The first sighting that she had, which was about 2 1/2 years ago, happened at night while she was letting our dogs back in from using the restroom. The dogs were unusually on high alert while she was trying to call them in. She saw and then heard a very large, dark bipedal “thing” running through the pasture behind us. From the sound she knew it was extremely heavy, and it was too quick for a person. I examined the area that night and the next day but the ground was too firm for tracks. I firmly believe she saw and heard a Bigfoot that evening. That brings me to her most recent encounter. On 3-4-22, about 9:20 P.M., I get a text from her while sitting in my recliner while she was in the bathtub that she sees red eyes outside the bathroom window looking at her! I wait for her to finish getting out of the bath to talk to her. She explains to me that while she was standing up to get out of the tub, she had the feeling of being watched. She looked over to the window and saw the red eyes looking at her about mid way up the window. After she saw them, she immediately looked away due to being startled. The motion light on that end of the house came on when she looked away, and when she looked back, whatever was there was gone. I asked her if she noticed the light coming on and off before she exited the tub and she said that she didn’t recall it coming on, but wasn’t really paying attention. She said she wouldn’t have noticed the light due to her being on her phone while in the tub, and most of, if not nearly all of the window in her line of sight is blocked by a large plant that’s by the window. The motion light is very sensitive and responds well to the slightest movement. After she saw nothing was there, she immediately closed the window and curtains. Now to give some context, earlier before she got in the bathtub, I sprayed some coil cleaner on the A-coil in our house to clean it. I turned on the A/C to help the cleaning process. By then she was already in the tub and was complaining to me of the smell going through the house from the coil cleaner. So I went to the bathroom and opened the curtains and the window for her so she could get some fresh air. She told me that she didn’t feel threatened by whatever is was looking at her, just startled to see red eyes and something right outside the window. She did not see the outline of a body, just the eyes. I asked how far apart the eyes were, and from what she showed me, it came out to be about 6 inches apart. Further apart than our eyes are for sure. She said that she did not hear it run away, and did not smell anything unpleasant, except the coil cleaner. After hearing this, I grabbed my .45 and walked outside to the window to examine the area. I had her go to the window on the inside so that I could get a little more information out of her. Understandably she was pretty shaken up at this point. When I get to the window she showed me approximately how high the eyes were off the ground and where they were positioned. Now keep in mind our house sits off the ground and isn’t on a slab. She said the eyes were just below the bottom sash bar of the window. When I opened the window earlier, I opened it up as far as it would go up. I’m 6ft tall and going off where she said the eyes were, I estimated them to be around 6ft 8 to 7ft off the ground. Now the angle that the eyes were in window, was perfectly in line to look through that plant I mentioned to examine my wife in the bathtub. Talk about freaky. I did not notice any footprints on the ground around the window or handprints on the house. I have been a believer in Bigfoot for years due to stories I’ve heard from certain people and things I’ve heard in the woods in past experiences. My wife has not been a believer but going off of the things that she has heard and now seen with her own eyes, she just might have changed her mind."

The non-visual encounter involved being followed by a prominent knocking sound through a heavily wooded area. The knocks came from ground level and followed me and another man for some time. The other individual is a hunting guide and spends extended periods in the mountains. He had never experienced or heard anything like that before. The visual encounter occurred at the summit of a nearby mountain: Monroe Mountain. Me and my father-in-law were scouting elk when we came across a big mountain goat that we followed out of curiosity. When we lost him we turned around and I saw two figures maybe 300 yards away, a taller one a shorter one, walking in the opposite direction from us. They looked very dark brown or even black and my impression was they were not human. My father-in-law did not see them but I insisted we drive over to where I saw them. It was a rocky ledge that ended in maybe a 20 foot drop. Whatever I saw was completely gone from sight in the maybe 60 seconds it took us to get there. The snow was old and hard this time of year, but there was a pair of tracks leading to the cliff edge."

Upon being out for several hours we stopped to rest and eat. We rested for 20 minutes or so when we stood up and turned around we could see down the mountain side. Something was standing there. We could see two legs and what looked like a hand and possibly a head. It looked like a brownish red color and even though we were so high up we could still see it was huge. When we both pulled out our phones to try and get a picture it walked off and that was the last we saw of it. If it was a bear it was not like any bear I have ever seen. I have no clue what it was.  We observed it for up to a minute and a half."

Around 7pm yesterday evening, 1/9/2021, I went out on my porch to listen to coyotes (which I hear some nights), and about a minute after the coyotes stopped I hear a very high pitched wail or moan that was in three intervals, each with higher pitched succession, coming from the next mountain ridge to my east. The tone, and duration of the wail or moan, was unlike anything I have every heard, and sounded out of place. It did not sound like the normal coyote sounds. It was very strange and made the hair on my arms stand up. I live in a very remote region of the Appalachians, about 15 miles southwest of Lexington, VA. I am an avid outdoorsman and an expert with most animal sounds in the region. I could not identify this sound."

My wife's head was hurting so she decided to take a nap we had heard something large walking in the woods but wrote it off as a bear or deer as both are plentiful in our area. She had been asleep for about an hour when I heard a large knock about 50 yards up in the tree line then about 15 to 20 seconds later several hundred yards up the ridge there was another knock. Both sounded as if someone had taken a 4x4 post and struck a tree with it. Then about 10 min later there was a splash in the water about 20 feet away from our boat. This splash sounded like something weighing 20 or 30 lbs had struck the water waking my wife. It's not unusual to hear large fish jumping at night but this was different after the splash no more than a couple minutes had passed and there was 2 more knocks. And they were closer than the first one. We pulled anchor reeled in our lines and as we were leaving we heard 2 more knocks. My wife said she heard the knocks up on the ridge but I didn't hear those, just the sound of a large animal walking up the river same way we were traveling as if it was following us. When it came to a shallow cove where it would have had to swim we stopped hearing the walking sounds. This is the second time we encountered this animal we had an experience about a month and a half earlier we heard a big animal walking around and had big splashes in the water as if it were throwing things at us on that night as well."
49902,Report 49902: Possible footprints found by a hiker on Mt. Ascutney,Class B,2015-05-24T12:00:00Z,43.43623,-72.43684,2015,Vermont,49902.0,"I research mountain lions in NH, but I was caring for my mother and hadn't gotten out since Christmas Day, 2014. On 5/24/15 I decided to just go for a walk, no research. I did a Meet-up with someone who walked much faster than me. She left me at the power line. I was way downhill, but was determined to at least make it to the power line. I did, but when I turned back to go down to the car, I saw two huge prints near a tree by the trail. When I got to them, the heels were 3-4 inches deep in the soil and leaves. They touched and the toes went out and away from each other like a duck's feet. They seemed to be 15 inches long, but it was hard to tell with all the leaves, unevenness, grass, etc. I took photos and measurements (even on a walk I take a camera and tape measure). It was interesting as hiding by that tree the Futures Trail went right past the tree, above was the power line and behind the tree was the park road, so that it was an advantageous hunting spot as animals coming from six different directions could easily be hunted down. Going back to the car, I saw two more tracks to the right of the trail. One was about 10 inches. The other seemed to be 15 inches, but with a 10 inch track inside it. The toes were 5 inches across for the three toes that were embedded in the bank. The other toes were over the hardened trail. There was also a 5x6 inch parallelogram shape. I kick myself now as I didn't take a photo. Later I saw a knuckle-walking gorilla on TV and thought, ""That's what that was!"" It was a knuckle print and also was very deep. At the bottom I asked the ranger to do a casting and he said I could instead, so I bought plaster of Paris. It wasn't enough. I had to go back several days later (rain). The casts are awful. There were too many leaves, the toes broke off, etc. The interesting part was that the park ranger acknowledged the report with a ""Yeah, we get lots of reports of bigfoots, but we try to keep it on the down low."" When I asked him about mountain lion sightings, he seemed scared and said, ""You think there are mountain lions up there?"" It was odd that bigfoot was ""normal"" and mountain lions were ""strange""! When I came back, I heard from someone else that this same ranger had been followed down the hill by something he nicknamed Roy. He was hoping it was a bigfoot and not a lion. Part of his job is to clear the trails and make sure everyone is off the mountain. That night it got dark, and he was also ""helped"" off the mountain, though ""it"" always stayed the same distance behind him."

It was about 3 to 4 feet tall, long dark brown to black hair, running on 2 legs. I caught the animal in my headlights very clearly. The one thing we both said was that it was fast. Faster than any animal we have ever seen. It was crossing the road into the swampy area near the small whetstone brook. There were tall reeds there and it disappeared into them. We did not stop. in retrospect, I wish I had. It might have answered some questions we both had."

I had been burning yard debris on the back of our property, east of Shelton, Wa.  We have a horse training facility on 6 acres backed up to a densely wooded hillside with a wetland on the southeast corner of our property. My burn pile was just west of the wetland area.  After I had fed the horses and closed up the barn I went to tend to the fire as I was standing there is when I heard a call, the closest thing I can compare it to is a howler monkey/ whooping crane mix type call with a low (almost subsonic) growl or rumble that was mostly felt, not audible.  The first call I didn't quite pay attention to, however the second call made my hair stand on end, and it was close (I would guesstimate within 100 yards). It was dark and because of the fire all I could see in that direction was darkness but I felt that I was being watched and possibly being called to. The call was not strained as in trying to carry distance but just to be heard.  I was frozen for a moment then I turned and quickly headed to the house when I heard the call one more time.  I have always been very much at home in the wilderness and have heard many different kind of critters but this was different and worth reporting."

We normally sleep with the bedroom window open since we like the sound of the rain and wind at night.  We heard the howl four times and could hear it echo throughout the area.

45360,Report 45360: Campers sleeping inside their tent hear clacking and are touched near Bumping Lake,Class B,2014-06-08T12:00:00Z,46.85524,-121.3034,2014,Washington,45360.0,"Let me begin by stating that my mother Renae Sampson is a member of the BFRO and has gone on multiple expeditions, is fairly knowledgable about Bigfoot activities and sightings, and has shared her stories with me. I am somewhat of a skeptic, but believe there is always a possibility of discovering new creatures on our planet, but until this past weekend I had never experienced anything first hand. Growing up in central and western Washington, my whole family has always enjoyed the wild outdoor spaces whether camping, day hiking, fishing or just exploring old mountain dirt roads. This past weekend June 7-8, 2014 was no different... We made camp at the upper Bumping Lake campground using 2 small tents and a picnic table tent. The weather was in the upper 70's to low 80's during the day, we had 3 young children ages 4-9, and 4 adults age 37-62. (Whether that's notable or not, I don't know- but I added it in case.) My brother and his family joined us only for the day leaving around 5pm. We rode bikes, played in the water, ate lunch, hiked around the campsite on animal trails, normal camping activity with kids. One notable strange thing happened happened around 6pm... My 4 year old son needed to use the restroom and we decided to walk through the small island of trees at the end of the campsite paved loop. We startled a deer in there and I remember thinking ""that's strange to see a deer in here with so much human activity around the campsites"" I wanted to try and take a pic with my iphone and tried to walk a bit closer. My son stayed right at my heels, also being curious if we could get closer. I don't know why, but I always call wild animals ""baby"" and spoke to this deer: ""it's ok baby, we won't hurt you"" etc. (And I honestly never would, no guns or any type of weapons for my family) So we move forward, the deer slowly walking away a few feet, nibbling some leaves, me moving forward, Deer looking back at me, deer nibbling leaves, the deer never being more than 20' away from us, until we emerge from that small island of trees, cross the paved road into an empty campsite near the restrooms. It was almost as if it wanted me to follow, it kept looking back at me, but never running off. My son looks up and says, ""I don't want to follow that deer anymore, Mama"" and I try to coax him along a bit more. He was adamant and did not want to enter that part of the forest. I follow the deer a bit more trying to get that ""one great nature photo"" and then I lost the deer over a small rise. I even crouched low to see if I could spot moving legs-nothing. What is interesting about this is that my son is very outgoing, adventurous and always wants to lead the way. Was some instinct holding him back? (Whether this is notable or not, I included it anyway) After dinner, my mom, son and I went for a drive up the dirt road (1800) all the way to the end and back. Got back to camp about 9pm, made a fire, sat around and told stories, watched bats flying, watched for shooting stars. The night was calm with not much of a breeze to notice, few clouds in the sky. The moon was in its waxing gibbous phase and visible in the southern sky straight up from our campsite. I put my son to bed in our tent, then stayed up with my mom at the campfire till midnight. I simply couldn't keep my eyes open any longer and quickly fell into a deep sleep. Here's where it gets interesting and something I will never forget... Maybe its the cool night air (approx 54F) or the glass of wine before bed, but I had to wake up and go potty. As I lay trying to convince myself to get out of my warm cozy sleeping bag and don my slippers to outside behind the tent, I hear off in the far distance toward the South part of the lake a ""Clack....clack, clack, clack"" and my brain races to identify the sound. By the time I realize I am hearing rocks clacking together I hear it again, in a definite pattern ""Clack....clack, clack, clack"". Now I am wide awake, on alert and must pee now! I have to say, I did not much want to get out of my tent at this point. Nevertheless, I did, and quickly went potty behind my tent and hopped back into bed. I remember thinking ""what the hell is that?"" I grabbed my headlamp and noted the time on my watch as a few minutes past 2am. I wanted to remember this and tell my mom in the morning. I would say I listened to this clacking occurring repeatedly every couple of minutes for approx. 10 minutes and somehow fell back to sleep. Here's where it gets freaky! I'm fast asleep and become aware that there is the sound of stampeding animals right behind my tent. Still in a haze of sleep, my head on my pillow up against the wall of our tent, I feel what seem to be fingers touch the back of my head in what I can only describe as a ""hard petting"". I feel the end of my tent beyond my feet on the inflated bed my son and I are sleeping on LIFTS UP! And then its placed gently back on the ground, like floating down! I reach out to touch my son and he is facing away from me with his arms and hands under the covers. He had not touched me....what did?! I hear something brush the side of the tent! And then, I hear my mom's voice in a loud shouting whisper: ""Jennifer!!"" I am awake and alert and scared at this point and try to call out to her but my voice won't come out. I am barely able to utter a weak mumble sound.  I hear the clacking rock sound closer now, in the near distance south of our tent in the ""Clack....clack, clack, clack"" pattern, with a responding ""Clack....clack, clack, clack"" from further away maybe south-west, maybe even from the other side of the lake. And then the closer sound again this time, rapidly: ""CLACK, CLACK, CLACK, CLACK, CLACK, CLACK""  I have to tell you I was completely petrified with fear at this point, could not move or speak. Somehow, like a miracle, I fell back to sleep. Again, with that night chilly air I woke with the need to pee. I woke up thinking ""Something weird is going on here"". I could still hear the occasional clacking far off now, in the southern distance. No longer feeling petrified with fear, I don my slippers, quickly potty behind the tent again and dash back to bed. I notice the sky is still dark, full of stars and the moon positioned in the south western part of the sky right above the mountaintops. I did not check the time, but imagine it was around 4-5am. I don't remember sleeping well, filled with fright and thought ""next time we're sleeping in my Explorer"" and then it was 8am. I could hardly wait for my mom to wake so I could tell her what happened. I rose before Mom and my son and walked around our campsite looking for any sign of a visitor. No Bigfoot footprints. My tent was still firmly staked down. Couple of fresh deer tracks on the trail behind our tents. WHAT THE HECK??!! Mom woke up and I recount my story to her of the night's events. She states she was not awake at all during the night, and doesn't remember calling out my name. The funny thing about that is that I've gone by ""Jen"" for 20 years, and only my parents still call me ""Jennifer"". Weird. We pack up camp with the intent of going to the other side of the lake for a hike along the Cougar/Swamp trail for a spell before we headed home. We wanted to get to the Boulder Creek crossing and were curious if my 4 year old son could make it. He did, and we had fun taking pics along the way, had a snack break, met some folks on the trail on the way back, not too hot, not too breezy...all in all a nice day. When we were about 15 minutes away from our cars at the trailhead, we heard a sound. A sound my mom and I have never heard before. We were in a thick wooded portion of the trail: close to the water on one side, and fairly straight up elevation on the other- meaning the hillside rose steeply upwards. I do not think either of us would be able to easily climb up this land covered thickly with Kinnickinick, Bunchberry, ferns, and many many trees growing closely together. This is where the sound came from...directly above us! Hard to describe, but sounded like this: ""HUMPF"" like coming from deep within a large animal, kind of guttural, but not a growl. And it was loud. And close. And no other sounds like the animal moving or walking through this thick vegetation. We all stopped and looked at each other wide-eyed. We looked up into the woods a bit but could not see anything through the thick plant life. I was a bit on edge and thought, ""let's get out of here!"" We continued the hike back to our cars and I remember thinking to myself, ""that was weird"", and what a weird night I had just experienced and why isn't my mom talking about this more?? She's the Bigfoot fanatic in our family! Didn't she think that was strange? Maybe she was meant to forget? Or not notice? I understand Bigfoot may have powers beyond our knowledge or capabilities. You never know... So, that is my story to the best of my recollection.  It scared the hell out of me. I literally felt paralyzed. I am intrigued. I will continue to go camping, and maybe...just maybe have another encounter-if that's how you would classify this story."

As soon as we stopped and turned off the motorcycles we heard what sounded like someone hitting a tree with a stick.  We initially didn't think much of it as we were not familiar with the immediate area and assumed that there were people near by.  Two of us walked closer to the intersection to see if there were other motorcycles or vehicles parked down the road. We found none.  After several minutes, hearing no other sounds, I picked up a stick and hit a tree two times.  Within three seconds we heard two or three very loud tree knocks.  At this time we got on our motorcycles and left the area immediately.  The next day two of us returned to the same location to see if we could find a trail or a campsite in the area where we heard the knocking. The forest was thick and there were no signs of any trails or camping sites .  I have the exact location marked on my cell phone gps."

We heard the vocalizations again at about 11:00 pm Saturday night and this went on for about 45 minutes, then again at about 4:30 am for about 10 minutes. The vocalizations were so powerful that it seemed like they were about a 100 yards away but it was probably 500 yards away but it was loud and clear, then did not hear anything on Sunday night. When I heard the first vocalization the hair on my neck stood up and I got my hunting pistol ready for action, for fear it would come into our camp. The bank is too steep to try to collect foot prints or pursue the creature. I have hunted all over Washington state in the past 30 years and never in my life have I heard a vocalization like that before. When it happened I knew darn well what it was its bigfoot."

I had some stacked up in a box. To the north and behind my house, the neighbors dog was barking like crazy from inside their fenced off back yard... There's thick barrier of brush between me and the next lot facing west so I couldn't really see the dog. I grabbed the two small pots and stood up and yelled at the dog to ""shut up"" just then the bushes in front of me started thrashing like crazy and deep growl/grunt/exhale emanated from behind them. It was surreal as sound seemed to penetrate right through me, whatever it was, it wasn't happy. Instinctively, I started to cover the distance to my shed about 35 feet and while I was on my way, I could feel/hear the ground pounding as ""whatever"" was moving for cover in the brush to the south. It was like ""boom, boom, boom, boom then it crashed into the woods and there was loud sound of sticks/branches breaking... I ducked to the shed and just stood there, confused as to what just happened. I waited for what seemed to be a few minutes, grabbed a sledge hammer for some protection and was just about to make a break for the house, when the bushes and branches behind the shed started snapping, again; it was like a buffalo was charging through them... So, I stayed put and I was getting kind of freaked out. Then there was silence for a few minutes and I made the dash for the house. Once inside I grabbed my Mossberg 500 loaded with ""00"" buckshot and headed back out on my back deck. There was nothing to see and even the dog was quiet... I thought about looking for tracks but, I reasoned it out that whatever could make the ground shake like that would be best left alone. I'm a cautious person by nature. I would have chaulked this up to maybe being a bear except for the pounding foot steps that shook the ground... I've had bear run past me before in this yard as I've been here for 19 years. There was no tell tale Squatch smell as the wind was blowing from the South West... However, two days later, there was a horrible musky skunk smell coming through my bedroom window. Needless to say, I closed it... Something was still out there... I've told this story to a few friends and it got me some weird looks... After recently reading ""The Hoopa Project"" and the many incidences recounted with ground shaking foot falls, I say, put me down for a class ""B"" incident that was too close for comfort... I think twice about going out to the mail box now."

My son and were planning to spend 2 nights and daughter and her son, just for the day. We set up camp, ate lunch and just enjoyed the day at the lake and surrounding area. Many hunters were leaving due to it being the last day of Bow season for Elk so we watched them being packed out by Mules and Horses. Beautiful day in the low 80's I would say. My daughter and her son left around 3:30 so it was just my son and I and the 2 dogs. He fly fished and I just relaxed and read at camp. At dusk we started a fire, ate and had a glass of wine.  I did a couple wood knocks but did not hear a response. Around 9:00 we went to our tents with a dog in each for the night. At 1:30 in the morning the dogs needed out to do their business so we did also then back to bed. My son snores terribly so my sleeping was intermittent. Our tents were between two trees about 8 feet apart and a foot from each other and the trees. I awoke sometime in the night and raised up because I heard the dog moving around. He was staring out the window towards the Lake. He did this several times that night, didn't bark or growl. I heard nothing that night except my son and the dogs snoring. September 15 Awoke early and we decided to take a hike to Blankenship Lakes and Meadow. Spooked a Rough Grouse on the way and met 2 Bow Hunters on the trail. They had no luck but said where they were camped at Blankenship was busy with coyotes during the previous night. When we reached the Lake one of the dogs Maggie would not leave Bob's side so we continued on. Got back to camp around noon. When dusk arrived we made a fire and I decided to do a call, one loud Whoop and immediately across the lake we got a return whoop and Elk on both sides of the lake started bugling back and forth to each other. Also a coyote yip then it was quiet for awhile and then more Elk bugles and a loud knock on the hill behind our tents. By this time my son was wide eyed and couldn't believe what he was hearing. I had told him of all of my expeditions and reports from others so he was a believer but had never experienced it for himself. We decided to go to bed and he immediately went to sleep snoring right away. I on the other hand was awake and listening when I felt something heavy stepping on the side of my tent where my arm was lying , I slowly moved my arm not making a sound because I didn't want whatever it was to know I wasn't sleeping. I felt my head being pushed down also as it went by and a loud swoosh on the tent fly. I was petrified and tried to call out ""Go Away"" but nothing came out. I was mute, but continued to try and say something to wake my son up. He and both dogs were snoring. After it passed my tent I continued to hear soft bipedal footfalls around our camp. I did not sleep all night. Around dawn I heard another wood knock. We got up , packed up and left. Very memorable trip for us, shook me up but I still want to have a sighting and will keep doing this.

Rainer. We parked at a forest service gate and walked in about 1 and a half miles to our spot, Where we have been many times before, its all old growth timber and really thick with old stumps and moss and what not, anyway, when we walked in my wife thought she heard an ax or something pounding on a tree. She said did you hear that? I was excited and finding mushrooms so I blew it off, and said come and pick this patch. An hour or so had passed, when I heard snapping and crunching about 100 yards away or so. And then we both heard thump thump thumping of what we concluded was a big rock pounding against a tree, now mind you, we are in the middle of pretty much nowhere, not a sole around. My wife and I stood in awe, and she said that sounds like wood knocks. My heart sunk as I watch a lot of bigfoot documentaries. I am an avid hunter and no all the sounds a forest or animal makes. Three minutes or so had passed from the tree pounding and crunching when all of a sudden SNAP, a tree or big branch we estimated around 5 or 6 inch in diameter snapped 20 feet behind us. We both jumped.as it was so loud and close.at that moment we ran. I said lets go, heck with the the mushrooms, as we were running past a lot. It was the scariest most unsurreal thing that's ever happened to me. 42 years in the woods and I never. I do not like to tell this story to my friends and stuff.as they laugh. But I know what we seen and experienced. Of all the times the one trip I did not carry my gun. Not that I would of shot.but I would of maybe got a picture or a visual or just felt more secure. Take this to heart, I will never hunt or look at the woods the same as long as I live. They are real whatever they are .THEY ARE REAL! Feel free to call me on this."
46809,Report 46809: Possible tracks photographed by an LEO hiking North of Loup Loup Pass,Class B,2014-10-19T12:00:00Z,48.44425,-119.9417,2014,Washington,46809.0,"Went hiking this last Sunday 10/19/2014 and parked off Service road 4235 off Hwy 20 on the Loup Loup Pass. Left my car about 0700 and crossed over a dirt berm that had been pushed up blocking another service road. Thought it would be as good a place to do some research on a book that my son is encouraging me to write. Had hiked about 1000 feet when I spotted what appeared to be deer tracks heading over the road and down into the ravine, took a few photos and went down into the ravine. About 200 feet down I lost the tracks and noticed my battery on my camera was almost dead, searched my pack, like a dummy I had left it back in my camera bag in the car. As I started back up in the direction of the car I heard 2 loud wacks of wood on wood about 6 or 7 seconds apart and about 300 feet above and to the right of me. Thought maybe hunters but had seen no signs of campers, no sounds of vehicles or rifle reports. Reached my car and got the camera battery and was ready to hike back out when I noticed that at the opposite end of the berm about 10 feet from where I had crossed earlier that some thing had crossed it and had slipped. I got a little excited thinking maybe a deer and a possible good track. What I found set me back a bit and had me starring for a bit. I have been all over the Cascades, Olympics and have been from Compo to Monument 78 on the Pacific Crest trail four times. Have heard a lot of strange and different sounds and have later been able to say bird, Wolf,Cougar, Bear, Elk, etc. This I don't know. If it was human, as an Investigator and Fugitive recovery agent it would not be someone I would take down. If it is an animal, it is one I have never seen or seen tracks of personally. After several moments the Investigator in me kicked in and I photographed the prints I found and cast the one that appeared the best defined. Not sure how the cast will turn out being on a slope and not having any ring to assist in the casting. While the cast set up I searched about for other tracks but the ground was very firm everywhere except around that berm. Collected the cast after 45 Min's and decided I would try to look for my tracks elsewhere. I know that it was hunting season, but had seen no one camping heard no sounds of vehicles or rifle reports from hunters that morning or for the rest of the day in that area."

Sep. 6, 2014. We were in a little cirque just down the trail from Lake Ann. From the bluff high above us (to our northwest) to a crag on the other side of the highway (to our east), there was a weird vocal exchange going on for 5-10 minutes. It weren't no bird. It wasn't a wolf howl... I'm trying to recall. It was rather high pitched, but it also varied... there were a variety of sounds. Two bear had been sighted up the trail at Lake Ann itself, but we didn't see them. We ran into two other hikers just after the exchange. They had also heard it and thought it strange. I just don't think it could have been human. For one thing, the points from which the exchange took place were so inaccessible, not good campsites. It was starting to rain. Night was falling soon. Humans would have camped together or used cell phones. And the sounds were eerie. Pranksters don't need to go to such remote places for an audience of so few. The sounds weren't like someone trying to spook us or joke. They were eerie."

Heard a whooping sound. I stopped talking to my friend and continued to listen. I thought it might have been an elk but after hearing elk sounds definitely not it. The whoop did not tail off . It was a medium, not high pitched whoop. Very loud. Only way I can describe it is like a football punt. Whooooooooop. But stops at the high point. There was 3 or 4 of them and lasted around 3 seconds each. Continued to hear and you could hear the rustle in the thickets. Ran inside to get my roommate to hear it. When we got back out all the dogs in the neighborhood were barking. Have had odd instances at the house such as someone knocking on bedroom windows, sometimes slapping the windows.. got a security alarm for we thought someone was trying to break in. Who knows.. will continue to keep an eye out."

I stood there a moment longer enjoying the peace when I heard a sound like an air raid siren. It stretched for 3 or 4 seconds and was followed immediately by 3 whoops.  My dog and I were both staring quietly for about 10 minutes and heard nothing else.  After hearing the sound I used my flashlight to search 180 degrees in the direction of the sound.  My dog was with me, he has a strong prey drive though he obeys very well, he heard it and did not move a muscle only stared in the exact direction that the sound came from.  This animal was within 70 feet of me so it was clear and fairly loud (as loud as an amplified siren we use at work).  I went up the following week to look for footprints but I believe it had rained too hard, I did find some but they were too skinny and only about 13 inches long.  I'm not a believer but am very intrigued as the only thing it sounds like is one of the sounds on your site.  Note most of the sounds on your site I find hard to believe.  Maybe someone can help me eliminate bigfoot from the possible list."

The next morning, Sat. June 14, 2014, we decided to drive up Baker Lake Rd. to look at the other campgrounds. We pulled into the Swift creek campground (formerly Baker Lake Resort) and paid for space 34. We parked our truck in our campsite and then took a walk above the lake shore. We came to an area that had a picnic table above the lake shore. Over to the right of us were a few people swimming in the swimming area. I sat on top of the picnic table with my feet on the bench (my son was over to the left of me, taking close up pictures of some flowers on the ground) and I was looking across Baker Lake to the other side of the lake with my binoculars. I was looking at the tree line near the shore directly across from me from left to right. Something caught my eye near a tree. It looked like a head next to one of the trees. I didn't see the whole part of a body going all the way down to the ground. I saw only the upper area of a body near the head and it seemed to be peaking out from the left side of the tree. My first thought was, it is watching the people over to the right of me swimming. I watched it for a few minutes trying to figure out if it was part of the tree, or a head with a face. I watched through my binoculars for a few minutes and sometimes would look from left to right of it and then back at it again. For a few minutes I kept seeing this head next to the tree and then I looked away and then back at it, and it was gone. That's when I realized that it was a head because it disappeared. If it was part of the tree, it would still be there. I told my son that I thought I saw a head near a tree and he didn't pay much attention to what I had said. He kept taking pictures of flowers. I can't definitely say it was a Bigfoot because I only saw a head, but a human would probably not be across the lake peaking out from the side of a tree. This didn't look like a human head. I have always had an interest in Bigfoot and I do believe they exist. Up until now I haven't seen one. My son and I thought we heard one yelling late at night back in Montana, north of Columbia falls."
48652,Report 48652: Target shooter hears strange sounds (see video) and finds possible tree-breaks and prints off of the Mountain Loop Highway,Class B,2015-05-09T12:00:00Z,48.13261,-121.3539,2015,Washington,48652.0,"Saturday May 9th my girlfriend I and were returning from an overnight camp off the Mountain Loop Highway. I wanted to find a place to shoot that was off the road and away from any trails, the river, or possible campers. Found a spot that didn’t have a car for more than a mile each way. Pulled over and loaded up about 10 magazines. Spent about 15 minutes getting everything ready on the tailgate of my truck. Heard absolutely nothing but birds chirping. I hiked down a ravine to the left of the road about 150 yards and shot off some rounds for about 15 minutes. Finished up and walked back up to the car where my girlfriend had been waiting. As soon as I came out of the ravine and onto the road we both heard a LOUD cracking / snap noise from the top of the wooded hill that was to the right of the road, the opposite side of where I had been shooting. We both looked at each other wondering what it was, our jaws dropped. It wasn’t a tree breaking because we didn’t hear anything hit the ground. There was also no wind less a sporadic slight breeze. We heard the noise approximately 6-7 times and there was about 30 seconds between each one. It was very loud and very, very close. The time between each one was also very consistent. My girlfriend and I both said that we could hear it coming form the top of the hill maybe 100 yards from the truck. We could also hear something moving around. Not twigs and branches snapping but it sounded like bark rounds being stepped on and ripping. A strange noise, it actually sounded like something ripping bark from a tree too. I grabbed my cell phone and walked up the hill to where the sound was coming from. Filmed about ten minutes. I was filming up and to the right of the hill for a good 6 minutes. As soon as I walked a little closer to the top of the hill and started filming to my left another cracking sound rings out, startled the hell out of me because it was so close. The camera actually shakes when the noise starts from me reacting. This was just about seven minutes into filming. I heard the sound of bark or something again, like it was peeling off a tree. I couldn’t help but think that the sound was coming from up in a tree. I got it on my phone and you can hear how loud it was, and how close. I would guess whatever was making the noise was about 50 yards away. Returned to the car and left. I thought it was very strange that this noise didn’t start until after I made all the noise shooting. When I made it to the area where the noise originated I could see my truck. It’s like whatever made the noise waited until it saw me get back on the road. The noise it made was so loud I am perplexed as to what it was. It sounded like a large branch being hit on a tree and snapping. I can’t think of any animal that makes any noise that loud. I’ve spent countless hours in the backcountry and camping and have never heard anything like it. As much as I wanted to climb the next 50 yards to the very top of the hill I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I had the feeling that whatever the hell was making that noise was protesting my being there. I still had my pistol on me but it was loud enough that I decided to head back to the car."

We kept doing tree knocks and still nothing. I began to feel an incredibly unsettling feeling, sort of like severe anxiety. I belted out a call, specifically a call thought to have come from child sasquatches. Around 7-10 seconds later I heard what sounded like a really heavy rock clunking against a tree.

It was about 8:15pm in late November 2014 so it was dark, chilly, and clear outside. I had just gotten home and walked up to my front door and was about to push my key into the lock when I heard, what I can only describe as, a “hooting” noise like “Hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot” in rapid succession. I paused and turned around slowly and walked to the edge of my doorstep listening closer and it happened a second time “Hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot.” Following the second vocalization, all of the dogs in town began barking and howling incessantly. The noises did not sound very close, but it was extremely loud and sounded like it carried over from the mountain just south of town. I waited a little longer, but heard nothing more and so retreated to my apartment.  It sounded extremely ape-like and I have never heard anything like that before or since. The closest resemblance to those noises that I can find are in vocalization clips found on The Gorilla Foundation website www.Koko.org/vocalizations, only the vocalizations I heard had more “scream” to them and were much louder and very powerful. The sound went right through you and came from something with a huge chest. This was no coyote, elk, owl or otherwise, none of those can make a vocal this powerful. No one else was around at the time."

We have herd about some weird things and encounters up there so we decided that we were gonna go see what was out there. I can't say I was expecting anything to happen but I was open to the idea of it. As we were driving up, we pulled off and were walking around on a game trail. I located an interesting footprint. I was able to make out toes on the print but I was unable to determine any other features since the print looks a few weeks old but still got a picture (which I still have). So we continued on. We found a road that was washed out so we went on foot about 2 miles in. We first went about half a mile in when all of a sudden a rock was thrown over our heads and landed in front of me. We thought it was very strange and a little creepy. We had some guns which in a way comforted us that we had some sort of protection. So we decided to keep moving. As we walked down this road, we kept hearing movement along the way. We had the feeling that we were being watched. Eventually it started to get dark so we start back to the truck and as we turned around another rock was thrown from behind, landing in front of us. We were very worried and my friend shot 3 warning shots into the air. We started speed walking back and continued to hear movement in the trees. We got back to the truck and got out of there. When we got almost back to pavement, we pulled off and just relaxed. It was night by this time and we were all in the truck. After a few minutes we started hearing movement again in the bushes. We stayed aware but didn't overreact like before. After about 6 minutes, something hit the truck. We flipped on out light bar and got out to see what it was. There was nothing around the truck that could've hit it except for a nearby stick. My friend threw the stick back in the woods and we all got back in the truck. It was about 5 minutes later in the same location when something hit the truck again. Like before we turned the light on and got out. We looked around for the object and it turned out to be the exact same stick. This is when things got weird because he threw the stick back in the woods and got back inside. Then it happened again and as we're outside, we threw the same stick back and we were still looking around as we continued to hear movement. Then as we were still outside, I saw the same stick fly out of nearby bushes and hit the hood of the truck. That's when we knew that we had to leave. This had all of us very upset and honestly frightened for our lives. At first I was open to the idea of a ""Bigfoot"" but after this night, I was convinced. I have since gone back up and have had other experiences but not as severe. Id be willing to show an expert."
55549,Report 55549: Two rock climbers hear wood knocks and footsteps in the early morning at a trailhead,Class B,2016-08-10T12:00:00Z,48.1917,-121.5757,2016,Washington,55549.0,"Me and my friend are rock climbers. We've rock climbed nearly everywhere in Washington state. The Pacific Northwest is the main area we've climbed in, and the area we know the best. He is a hardcore skeptic. I on the other hand am a firm believer. I've done tons of research through books and documentaries and consider myself to be fairly knowledgeable about the subject. After this experience my friend is now been having some second thoughts. It all started in the early morning... We drove up to the trail head about 5 miles on a gravel trail to the trail head. We got out of the car and put on our packs, locked the car and started to head up hill. Ours was the only car in the small parking lot. While filling out the trail registry that's when I heard the first knock up hill about 30 yards away. Like two minutes later another knock was heard down the hill and past the road, about 50 yards off. Every now and again you could hear sticks breaking like something was stepping on them. The sound of one stick breaking was heard then silence. I tried to do my own knock and that was responded too after about 30 seconds. That's when we started filming. After the film we decided to move uphill to go and climb. My friend still wasn't really buying it. He thought they were just sticks falling off of the trees. After walking about 17 feet up the trail we heard another knock in the same place. By this time my friend was asking me if they're ever hostile. I was thinking about it being intimidation but I didn't think that's what they were getting at. After walking about 30 more feet up the trail we heard the sound of a rock tapping on a tree, in a very repetitious pattern. For my friend this was the point were he was staring to take things seriously, and wanted to leave. I had no rejections. Before leaving I tried looking down the hill (where the other knocks where coming from) to see anything. The terrain didn't drop off like expected. The road was only three or so feet higher. The woods where very dense. Anything could hide in them. A few days later we went back up to the same place to actually climb, only to be shut down by the rain. We still decided to do the hike up to the base of the climb anyway. After a little while I thought to make a knock as well as some whoops to see if there was anything in the area. I had no response. About half way up we saw a standard stick structure. As well as a whole lot of tracks going up the trail. We were the only ones on this mountain by this point. And by the looks of it the creatures followed the same trail all the way up the mountain. Until the part where the trail goes out into an open boulder filed."
56232,Report 56232: Possible knocks and vocalization heard from inside a home near Buckley,Class B,2018-04-30T12:00:00Z,47.1862,-122.1054,2018,Washington,56232.0,I was awake and laying in bed with the window open at around sunrise. I heard two wood knocks that sounded very close in the nearby forest followed immediately by a more distant howl. It was a very deep howl. It sounded like a large animal. I have heard elk bugles and this was not what I heard. I have also heard coyotes from here so I am familiar to what they sound like. The sound seemed too deep and guttural to be from a man or any other familiar animal.
56332,Report 56332: Snowshoers find possible tracks in the Antoine Peak Conservation Area,Class B,2017-01-08T12:00:00Z,47.73081,-117.159,2017,Washington,56332.0,"Sunday January 8th, 2017. My husband and I were snowshoeing out from my parents property towards Antoine Peak conservation area around 12:30 pm. We had gone for about 45 minutes away from the house, seeing lots of wildlife along the trails including deer, rabbit and moose. There were lots of tracks along the way as well. We came upon a trail where all of a sudden the deer trails we had been following, swerved off the main trail and up the hillside. Up ahead was a single set of tracks that appeared to be a bi-pedal animal of some kind and there the smell was something awful. We weren't sure what to make of the tracks at first so we just continued along the trail. I immediately noticed how far apart the tracks were and became very aware of what we COULD have been looking at. I had my husband try to  match his stride to those of the tracks, and he came up  VERY short. We didn't  come prepared with tape measures or anything like that, but my Husband is 5'9"" and he could only get to about half of the stride length.  We  continued to follow the trail of tracks for several hundred feet and they suddenly turned and,  what looked like, jumped off the side of the hill towards a clearing where there is a pond in the summer months. At the time there was about a foot of snow on the ground and the following day, another 6+ inches fell. We are not sure what created these tracks, but I am unaware of anything with such characteristics in this area."

As we pulled into the dirt road that brings you to the campsite there was a tree covering the road into the site so we moved the tree and proceeded down to the campsite. We found as we got there that the previous campers have left their gear and it seemed as though they were in a hurry but we didn't think much of it other than that they were rude and disrespectful for leaving garbage and stuff laying around. After we got camp set up and got a fire going it started to get dark and down about a hundred feet of elevation in a two hundred yards away we heard a noise that none of us had ever heard before sort of like a really rapid yodel or tongue trill. The girl I was with was immediately frightened and hid behind me and my other friend said guys don't get too freaked out it's either like a wolf or a coyote and we listened again as it covered that 200 yards distance in about two seconds. Became much louder and four or five times vocalized this yodel I almost couldn't answer it from fear, but I was able to let out a scream. After I screamed it became silent and then behind us something hit our truck, sounds kept happening around us and we started to try to see what it was. This noise was very loud and very close and quite obviously directed at us. After that we heard wood knocks through the night but no more Close Encounters as I stayed awake most of the night in fear with one hand on my knife and one hand on a flashlight. This was amazing and intense and absolutely true I was definitely skeptical about the existence of Bigfoot before this trip and now I have absolutely no doubt that they are real."

Sounded like the combination of a Howler Monkey and Bear's death moan. It sat us both up and my girlfriend who's a Wildlife Biologist and lived in the Yukon immediately asked me what was that.? I responded that I've never heard anything like it and initially said a howler monkey escaped from the zoo. It was long increasing howls that were felt as well as heard and had a tone and character almost primal in nature. They continued for 10 minutes at 2 to 3 minute intervals lasting 10 seconds I'm guessing. We both backcountry camped Glacier NP the Yukon and Denali and have never in our 30yrs of Wilderness exploration heard anything like this. I stayed awake until sunrise than slept until noon. Returning home we searched databases on North American mammals sound archives and found nothing like this. We found what we heard exactly under a Google search that played Sasquatch Vocalizations and decided we should at least report it. We don't know what it was and have no opinion as to it's source but can say with her Scientific Background and my Lifetime Wilderness Exploration we've never heard anything like this and now I wonder if perhaps there is something to Native American legends his grandmother told him about regarding ""Stick Men"" or ""Forest Giants."""

It seemed like it would happen in one spot & then another would respond in another area. The next couple nights it seemed to get closer until it sounded like it was in the woods right behind our tent. (Very loud knocks, usually 2 at a time.) Also got growled at 4 times from right outside the tent one night maybe @ the sixth night. We stormed out of tent with guns & flashlights & didn't see anything & didn't hear anything running away! Also during the day after hunting we came back to find a smaller tree with full fresh rootball placed across the entrance to our camp site. (It wasn't dragged there, there was no dirt drag marks anywhere & we looked around & couldn't find where it was pulled from. There were also some other big limbs placed there too. (I have pics of the tree.). Keep in mind there was no other campers or hunters in the whole valley the whole week.) The last night we came back to camp and a large healthy green pine tree was pushed over in the woods & landed right in the middle of our camp. This was the last straw for us, we couldn't take the stress anymore & needed sleep. We left camp and drove to my families cabin at Priest Lake & slept there. My buddy left the lantern on in the tent before we left and when we came back the next morning the tent zipped was unzipped about 6-7 inches & we had zipped it up tight. I also have pics of this & the bigger tree that was pushed over."

My wife described three whoops as being VERY close and a short time later, maybe a few minutes, another series of whoops farther away as if the animal was moving away. She said it was unnerving to the point that she wasn't going to leave the tent the rest of the night.  She described the sound as nothing she has ever heard before.

By the time we got there the campground was full. We kept driving and stopped at the first logging road that had a suitably flat spot for camping (we sleep in the back of our SUV). It was a short dead end logging road in a recovering clear-cut. We set up camp and went to sleep. Around 2:30 a.m. my wife awoke to our pet rabbit scrambling around in the driver's footwell. The rabbit had gotten down there and couldn't get back up. As my wife reached up there to rescue the bunny, she felt something firmly touch her leg. She described it as a firm press and then deliberate, downward motion. At first she was confused because we were inside the car, but then she remembered that we kept the sliding rear windows open slightly for ventilation. The spot where she was touched was pressed against that opening (we built a sleeping platform in our car that puts us near the level of the windows). She heard nothing super obvious, but immediately afterward she thinks she heard a couple of extremely light footfalls. We stayed mostly silent for about an hour, just listening for anything, but heard nothing else. I finally mustered the courage to peek out a window, but couldn't see anything. The next morning we found very large, muddy fingerprints on our car, near where my wife was touched. We have pictures of these prints which we would be glad to submit. In the photos you can see where I tried to recreate the prints with my own fingers. I have medium sized hands and the prints are MUCH larger. We looked around a bit taking note of things. On my wife's side of the car was only a fairly narrow strip of road, and after that was dry, crunchy grass and brush. Whatever touched her had to be able to walk along that narrow strip, otherwise we would have heard it in the dry brush. It also had to be tall enough to reach the window. We feel these factors probably rule out four-legged animals. We considered the idea that a person could have been messing with us, but there are some issues with that which make us skeptical. First, we feel a person wouldn't have been so quiet. Second, we find it hard to believe someone trying to scare us would have simply touched her leg, left prints, and called it good. More than likely a person would have taken things farther than that. That would really be showing a lot of restraint for a prankster.  Last, the prints would have been a VERY large person. One who also though to get their hands muddy beforehand. "

No one had been in the are for at least 2 days because previous tracks were covered by Saturdays storm. We turned off the main road and onto a side road and rode a few hundred feet before we stopped at a bridge crossing a stream. As soon as we took off our helmets we heard a loud howl/moan sound that lasted 8-10 seconds. We looked at each other in shock. Another howl followed about 8 seconds behind it and then we head a loud bang on a tree in the opposite direction. It was like a super loud woodpecker just pecked once. A few seconds after we heard a large tree branch break in the direction of the howl and then heard a third howl. Two more loud wood pecker sounds then followed with about 5 seconds in between. The scream seemed like it was from a mile away, but in the dense trees it was likely much closer. The wood noises and loud break sounded like they were within 50 yards or so. Then it was silent for about 5 minutes and we started to get ready to leave and the howls started again, but seemed like they were twice as far away. After about 6 more howls with 5 seconds or so in between, we decided to leave the area. Neither of us have ever heard anything like it. It seemed like it had an amplifier and we were the only people within about a 8 mile radius. I listened to the ""Ohio howl"" and it was close but longer and more fluctuation in some of the moans."

I was up looking for oyster mushrooms in the hills west of Baker Lake Rd by Grandy Creek.  I have had several experiences in the fall time over several years.  Anyway, as I was walking in on a wooded hillside and happened to look down and saw an impression in a mossy patch that looked like an old sasquatch track. The ground is not good for impressions except for the mossy patches.  It measured 15 inches long. It was broad at the toes, and had a wide heel,  There was even a rise, in the middle of the track, as if  from a mid-tarsal break. It may not be a track, it may be a track. If a track, it had been there for some time, as it had small debris sitting in it. I was up there this fall,and the possible track was still in the same condition so it should still be able to located.  BTW I got a good haul of oyster mushrooms that day. I have heard deep rhythmic grunts, followed by a tree shaking in the creek bottom. My dad and I heard this breathing that was loud and angry sounding.  Possible it could have been a grizzly, but it was somewhat different than sounds I have looked up on the internet. I had small rocks thrown at me. My wife and I heard 3 wood knocks one after the other from 3 different but close locations. All these incidents happened from about 2008 until present.  I only wish I had a visual but I think the rock throwing was the incident that nailed it down for me."

First day of modern elk season, high above the Humtulips River area. As I was setting up my truck tent for the night on a remote spur road I heard what I believed to be elk movement in the gulley/ravine below me. The area is a good elk hunting location and I have had success there in the past. It was too dark at the point to pursue any bull so I decided to make a cup of coffee, fire up my lantern and do a little reading before crawling into my truck tent for the night. It was a few minutes after I sat down that I heard a tree in the high timber above me being moved. It sounded like it was being pushed or shoved until it crashed to the forest floor. I am familiar with timber and have spent my entire life running chainsaws and around logging. The tree was large and there was no wind or weather. So I rationalized it as just a weakened tree in the forest that possibly a bear or other large mammal just happened to rub against until it came down. But what happened next unnerved me unlike anything I have ever experienced. About five minutes after the tree incident, I head extremely loud limbs breaking, like fir or hemlock limbs literally being snapped from a tree. The echo of this resonating through the deep timber and deep into the ravine below me. It seemed to be around 100-120 yards above me to my north. Then I heard the same thing in the ravine below me, and another smaller tree snapping and crashed. Then I heard a very odd sound. I have tried to describe it to my family and all I can compare it to is almost a primate like sound, and it echoed through the timber. At this point I packed up and drove the 7.5 miles back out to the gravel forest service road. I have never been as unnerved as I was. I had the overwhelming sense of being surrounded, and could not rationalize what I had encountered. I have spent my entire life hunting and camping in the backcountry of Washington and Oregon. I am a big game hunter and hunt alone much of the time. I am familiar with big game in Washington. I have no explanation for what I heard."

We would here it down the road a bit, up the mountain and then you would here a response from across the road where a creek flows and it is dense brush, maybe a hunting trail. We were sure it was not trees creaking from the weight of the snow...We had not heard this sound. I got really full of anxiety and wanted to leave so we did.

A friend and I started our hike from Forest Service road 73 into Mt. Rainier Nat'l. Park via the trail that goes past Lake Eleanor. This was the closest we could get to our fishing destination, (Oliver Lake) due to longtime road closures in the area. We hiked in on maintained trails through Grand Park and down to the White River and then up Lake James. From that point it was a cross country bushwhack past Lake Ethel along Mosquito Flat onto Marjorie Lake. Our plan was for two nights at Oliver Lake but with some route finding difficulty we stayed at Marjorie lake for one night. The next morning we hiked for about fifteen minutes and located Oliver lake, set up camp and then began fishing. As we fished around part of the lake from approximately 11:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. I found it odd that I did not see any sign of other human evidence of any kind, ie; fisherman trails, trash, areas previously camped in, etc. By the way the fishing was fantastic all catch and release except for the last one, a nice 15 inch rainbow trout which was dinner. Later that night at in the tent my buddy and I were sharing, my buddy was fast asleep and I was tossing and turning trying to get comfortable. Suddenly I hear guttural low pitched screams coming from the ridge above us, which I estimate about three hundred feet up. Every inch of my body is at attention now and I am trying to figure out what is making the noise. The screams came in quick succession and total about 8-10 screams. By the time I wake up my buddy the screams have stopped and I explained to him what I heard. We continued to listen and did not hear anything else and eventually went to sleep. I am writing this now because it jogged my memory from watching a bigfoot show on TV last night and it really struck a chord with me and to reach out and report what I heard. I have been an active hiker, camper and fisherman for many many years and have stayed in many remote places here, Canada, Europe and South America and have never heard this type of low pitched guttural screams. I have come across bear and cougar and did not attribute this sound to any of those species. No one else in the area knew where we were going except for the park staff that gave us the permit at Carbon River Ranger Station."

65464,Report 65464: Vocalizations near the summit of Silver Star Mountain,Class B,2020-05-15T12:00:00Z,45.74796,-122.2389,2020,Washington,65464.0,"My girlfriend and I both had Friday off, 5/15/20, and decided to go do one of our favorite hikes up to Silver Star Mountain in Skamania County, Washington. We live in Portland and go up to that hike at least once or twice a year. We regard it as one of our favorite hikes in the area due to its proximity to home and its sheer beauty. I was born in rural SW Missouri, and then spent my formative years growing up in Colorado. I am an avid outdoorsman and spend a large amount of time backpacking, hiking, camping, snowboarding and surfing in the wilderness (as well as my girlfriend). I went to school for/work in environmental science and have years of experience collecting data in nature, including animal tracking and navigation. We left around noon and arrived at the Grouse Vista Trailhead and began our hike at 1PM. The hike is around 6.8 miles roundtrip and can be challenging on the way up due to the 2,000 feet of elevation gain to the top of Silver Star Mountain. The trailhead was filled with cars, although most of the foot traffic we encountered was on the way up as others were headed down. We like to hike in the afternoon for this very reason. We are both active/fit and didn’t stop on the way up except for once when nature called. Near the top, we encountered some snow (as was expected), but not nearly as much as the year prior. We finished the hike and were at the top of Silver Star Mountain. It was overcast with patches of sunlight, but no wind or rain and was generally pleasant. During that time, we were alone on the craggy peak and only a handful of other people were on the ridge to the south. The mountain is surrounded by valleys carving through the landscape on all sides. My girlfriend is in the medical field as was on call that day. She was digging through her backpack for her work phone to check voicemails (we had very limited service). I was rummaging through my pack for snacks. It was during this time that I heard the first series of very strange noises from the closest valley to the north. It was a distinct and loud “whoooo-ooop whooo-ooop”. The first “whoooo” segment of the noise was deep, with second “ooop” part having an extreme pitch change that I could not correlate to a known animal. I ask my girlfriend if she heard it, but she was preoccupied with her phone. It was around this time that a couple of other hikers showed up with their dog. We wanted to sit out on the rocks overlooking the views, so we moved slightly further down the ridge from them to a rock outcrop and ate some snacks and took photos (I can provide these photos for reference). In between conversation, the noise happened again from the same spot in the valley to the north. It was about 15 minutes from the first one. It was loud and filled the entire valley, giving me the feeling that it was a rather large animal. My girlfriend heard it this time and we both looked at each other puzzled. The other hikers behind us were carrying on conversation and didn’t seem to be paying attention to the noise, but their dog had kept going to the ridge and looking to the direction of the noise. We waited in silence to hear it again, but never did. We decided to head back down the trail. About halfway back down, the trail passes beneath Pyramid Rock. We had always wanted to scramble this rock to see the views and felt energized that day to do so. Pyramid Rock is comprised of loose talus and can be dangerous to climb. We picked our line going up the north side of the rock, which was rather steep, and came to a shallow cave toward the top. It was probably 20 feet wide and 20 feet high, but maybe only 10 feet deep. There were remnants of a campfire here, as well as a 4-foot wall or blind made of stacked rock around the entrance. After making it to the top, we decided we were hungry so we high-tailed it back home. Upon returning home, I decided to check BFRO for reports from Silver Star Mountain and found Reports #13115, #1652. These reports are from the exact area we were in. The photos included in Report #13115 were taken from the top of Silver Star Mountain where we were sitting and heard the noises. I would also like to note that the first few seconds of the Berry-Morehead “Whoops and Knocks” audio here on BFRO are nearly identical to what we heard that day."

That creek runs out to another creek that is part of the river and creates an island that used to be part of the property.  It is very secluded. The summer of 2018, my sister-in-law and her (adult) kids had been camping out at the property on several occasions, cleaning out trees and undergrowth, as they had bought trailers and needed to do a bit of landscaping to get their rigs in there.  My husband had a load of crushed gravel taken out there in 2009 that we used to put in the fire pit area and bolster the ground as we had a trailer at the time and needed a place to set up camp without sinking into the mud up to our axels.  We had spent almost every weekend that summer out there.  There was still quite a mound left, so SIL used that gravel to cover the area (nobody had used that area of the property on a regular basis for about 9 years at that point).  She also made a sweet little walk-way from the fire pit to one of the camp spaces about 40 feet away. On the weekend of August 18-19, 2018 we were camping at the property.  One of my step-son’s was up visiting from Texas and my husband wanted to have a BBQ for him and our daughter-in-law with the family.  We took our motorhome out to the property on Saturday afternoon and met my SIL and BIL who had gone out the night before in their rig. We stayed up talking til about 9:30PM.  Then right after dark I went into the m/h, my husband came in about 30 minutes later, his sister went into their trailer about the same time, then I heard our BIL go in about 10:15 PM.  I had a window open as it was a pretty warm night, and the shade up about 5” and their door was open, so I could hear (and see the flickering light) that he was watching a movie, as was I.  Our rigs were parked about 70’ apart with a few scraggly, leggy plants and the large fire pit area between us, but otherwise an unimpeded view. My husband had gone to bed at the back end of the M/H.  I sat up at the dinette until about 12:15am, finally deciding that I was sleepy enough to go to bed.  I closed and locked the window and the shade, made sure all the doors were locked, got into my jammys and got into bed.  My husband was sound asleep, as was our 6 month old Golden Retriever puppy.  Within 3 minutes my brain was settled enough to begin dozing off. Suddenly… Bang…Bang…Bang!!! It sounded like 2 baseball bats being slammed together, about 3 seconds apart!  It seemed like it was coming from the rivers’ edge, or closer? 60 feet, 100 feet away.  I didn’t know.  Pretty close! My eyes flew Wide open staring into the pitch black room!!  I KNEW instantly what that was!!! 15 seconds went by… nothing, so I was closing my eyes.  Then… Bang…Bang…Bang!!! It sounded like it came from up the creek, maybe a hundred yards.  I don’t really know..  on the island?  Oh Sh.., there are Two of them!!  15 more seconds went by (yes!  I was counting!!  My Navy training kicking in) Bang…Bang…Bang!!!  The closer one again. Another 15 seconds… Bang…Bang…Bang!!!  Up the creek My heart was pounding so hard, I was afraid that it might literally explode!!  Caught in the pitch black woods in my fiberglass box!!!  Are the doors lock?  Are the shades drawn?  Did I close all the windows?  Can they rip the doors open?!  Would they smash in the windows?!!!  Would the family find us dangling from tree branches tomorrow afternoon?  Did “B” hear it and shut their door?  It was so loud!  He must have heard it!!  I can’t call him, we have no cell service down in this gawd-forsaken hole!!! Next thing I know…it’s 8AM Sunday morning..  How the heck did that happen?!  After all that banging and fear I thought I would be awake all night!!  Nope, I fell right to sleep!!!  Strange thing for me to do in light of the fear and emotion running around in my little chicken brain!!!  I peaked out the windows..nothing.  Oh!  There’s my SIL sitting at the campfire. I put on a pot of coffee and walked over to visit her for a few minutes.  I asked her if she heard any noises last night.  No, she didn’t, but she sleeps like a log she said (so does her brother).  Well, that is strange.  I KNOW that happened before I fell asleep, I KNOW IT!  I had only been in bed a couple minutes.  I wasn’t even asleep yet! So, I headed back over to our rig to start breakfast.  And THERE IT WAS!!  MY PROOF!!  That I was not insane and hearing things!! Half way between the fire pit and our door, right at the edge of the little gravel walkway was a lone footprint!!  About 15” long.  About 6” wide at the ball, the dirt was mounded at the metatarsal break and the heel was square.  I had seen that same foot 17 years before, out on the sandbar, when it was only about 4” long!!!  OMG!!!  I was thrilled to pieces!!  But freaked out at the same time! I went to the rig, grabbed my cell phone and took 3 good pictures.  I’m so glad I did too!  Later that afternoon, people started showing up and I showed it to everyone.  I took my nephew over to look at it and my golden girl followed us, we were looking at the footprint, when she decided to lay right down next to it (for a tummy rub) and wiped it out with her tail!!!  Oh man, that was horrible to see!  I knew they were there, but now I have my own proof!"
65650,Report 65650: Possible vocalizations on Little Si Trail outside North Bend,Class B,2015-10-31T12:00:00Z,47.49488,-121.7555,2015,Washington,65650.0,"I was hiking at Little Si in Washington State with a friend who was visiting from out of town. It was pouring rain so we left our phones but we went anyway and started our hike sometime in the morning. We got to an interesting little part off the trail where a little waterfall was pouring off from a cliff above, maybe like 20 feet up. We turned back after that spot and started heading back but while we were walking we heard what I first thought was an alarm, but it sounded organic. At the end of the “alarm” was a very strange vocalization like an ape mixed with human. The alarm sound happened over 10 times and at the end of each sustained holler was the strange vocalization. After the second or third alarm sound and vocalization I started making the sounds back to whatever it was. My friend and I both listened intently trying to identify what the sound could possibly be. We ruled out human right away because whatever was making that sound had a huge lung capacity and we both immediately knew it couldn’t be human. As we listened, and I kept responding, the way the mouth moved made us also rule out a wolf or coyote. It sounded like it had lips...I know that sounds strange but we both said whatever was making the sound had a mouth like a human or ape. I responded three or four times before I realized what else it could possibly be. “Amy, we gotta go. NOW” I said. She asked why and I said, “I think I’m hitting on a Sasquatch. We have to get the hell out of here.” I know I’m making it sound like a joke, but I grew up hearing about Sasquatch stories and I never thought they could be actually real. So I was a little joking when I told her I was hitting on a Sasquatch but the sound was so large, reverberating through the mountainside, I also thought whatever that is sounds like it’s getting closer and the only thing it could possibly be, however unlikely, was a large beast with lips like a human or ape. So, we ran. We ran the rest of the way down the trail and got to the car where our phones were. We didn’t see anyone else on the trail. When we got our phones out I googled Pacific Northwest wildlife sounds to try and find out what it “really” was. We looked up wolf, coyote, elk, and anything else we could think of. So I finally said, “We have to look up Bigfoot sounds...it’s the only thing left.” She looked at me and nodded. She didn’t grow up hearing any stories of Bigfoot because she is from the Midwest. I found a few recordings and immediately the hair on our arms and neck stood straight up. This was 5 years ago but just writing this I’m getting goosebumps all over again. I was at an art sale today in Leavenworth and a man was selling art. We bought a painting with a Sasquatch standing behind a tent and it reminded me of this story. That artist doesn’t really know much about Sasquatch but said since painting them he’s heard countless first hand stories from people out there and so I shared mine with him. It made me want to see if there was anyone else who would want to know, and my brother sent me here. Anyway, thanks. It feels good to get this experience out to the right people. I’m still skeptical but cannot deny what I heard, and I still have no explanation for it. The vocalization  I heard was very similar to the Sierra recordings (forgot the name of the guy who recorded them) but the sustained big barreled “alarm” with the sounds at the end was a bit different than those recordings. I was going to change the date because it happened on October 31st, and I thought no one would believe me. But it is what it is. Also, we were so freaked out that I left a note warning other campers and made an email address asking if anyone else heard it, to contact me. No one has (I haven’t checked it in years, however)."

We has built a fire and when the sun had set I mentioned to my wife that Sasquatch's are known to answer howls. I am on the BFRO site 4-days a week to track sightings and am a firm believer after reading Dr. Meldrum's book: Sasquatch-Legend Meets Science. I made a howl like the 1994 Moaning Howl Ohio call recording on this site. I am a trained vocalist and can project my voice loudly. I cupped my face and let out a howl. Its was answered. I was facing east and let out a howl every 30-60 seconds that was answered progressively closer. Astonished, I kept it up and the return was always closer. My wife fled to into the RV in fear. My son would not come out. I was not in fear but in hopes of seeing a Sasquatch. I did not have my cell phone with me to record the sasquatch returning howls. I grabbed my .44 magnum revolver (just in case) and a flashlight scanning the trees in hopes to see a illuminated red pair of eyes. As soon as I had my pistol in my hand there were no more returning howls. I was never in fear but in awe. There must have been 10-12 howls and returns. With the first reply. I would guess that the Sasquatch at least a mile away and with the last, maybe a 1/4 to an 1/8 of a mile if not closer. On 6/30/2020, we returned home and I had my wife and son listed to the 1994 Ohio howls. They were shocked that that was what they had heard."

66003,Report 66003: Howls heard near Spokane River,Class B,2020-09-02T12:00:00Z,47.75026,-117.5152,2020,Washington,66003.0,"Heard: at approx 2:15am my labrador retriever started barking at something outside.  This is not unusual as we live on a closed golf course which is adjacent to Riverside State Park and we often have varying types of nature near our home.  After letting the dog out to relieve himself I returned to bed.  Outside temp was approx 55-60 degrees and we had the bedroom windows open.  Our bedroom faces the closed golf course. What I heard next was a loud howl. At first I thought it was a police car or ambulance traveling on highway 291 that had turned on its siren, but then the sound simply went from soft to loud to suddenly stopping. So, it was not a siren.  I listened intently to try to figure out what was going on and about 2 minutes later I heard a similar but more faint ""siren"" sound. This was not a coyote or a wolf, nor was it the sound of a neighbor's dog.  The sound was different and as I said, it sounded like a siren with only one whooooooo. I noted the time (2:20am).  It sounded like it could have been a few blocks away (I thought around 7 Mile Road). I have been checking local websites and facebook groups to see if anyone else heard it, but so far nothing.  I can't be the only one to have heard this.  Perhaps a person was making the noise as part of Big Foot hunting?? The other thing I'd like to report is that we feed birds and squirrels in our yard.  Approx 6weeks prior we had our squirrel feeder torn off the tree at night.  We heard a crash outside and couldn't identify anything that particular night but the following morning we discovered the feeder's lid which is crewed into the top on a heavy hinge, was ripped off.  We jokingly said maybe we should look for Big Foot prints or hair in the area. Anyway,  the howl was definitely something not of the ordinary. Thank you."

Adams and Mt Saint Helens areas. I headed up on a hike on Wed. the 23rd of September at a place called Spencer Butte. It's located Outside of Cougar and is a steep hike of 1800 elevation gain (it sits about 4300 ft). My friends and I headed up the hill in the morning at about 8:30 am. The weather was very rainy. We were trying to be very observant of any sounds or tracks. About half way up the mountain my friend turns to me and says 'did you hear that? it sounds like people yelling' I listened for a moment and heard what I would describe as a distant yowl...far up the trail. It was faint but distinct. We continued up the trail and eventually reached the top. My guess is it was about 10 am. Once we had reached the geological marker at the top, my friend and I began a search splitting directions. I continued through the trees and brush for about 75 yards from the geological marker and came to a clearing. I sat for a few moments and noticed that beyond the clearing...roughly another 35 yards or so was an alder that was shaking. I could just see the top of it, but there wasn't wind at the time and it was shaking intermittently. It happened several times. I thought I had an animal...possibly an elk pushing against the tree. I approached it and paused as I could hear something begin to move away. I then backtracked...grabbed my friend and he followed me over to the area. We proceeded to move around the area on either side hoping to see what it was. It was gone...Once I got to the tree I was surprised by how big the trunk was. Something big must of moved it. We split up again and I went back the way I came. As I was walking I came across a bit of mud and gravel. I noticed something very distinct. A Print. It was a left foot. I could see all of the toe outlines and it was much much bigger than my foot. I took a picture with my phone. We didn't have any other incidents but that sound, tree shaking and print are very compelling evidence. The location was also very compelling. The print was well away from the initial trail and geological marker. I have always been a believer, My grandfather researched and searched for bigfoot and before he died gave me his plaster cast from California. On another note, A few months ago had a very strange early morning (2:30 am) whistling experience, with eye shine earlier, movement and a dog that was very wary (but fearful) of something in the back woods near my house. I live in the Jim Creek area in Arlington, Wa. I can share more on that at a later date if interested."

At 9:30am 1/2 mile up the trail I stopped for some water and stepped over to look at the rock pit. While stepping back to the trail I heard  loud wood knocking sounds for about 10-15 seconds. I listened for a few more seconds and then got my phone out to record the knocking sounds. In my recordings you can hear one powerful knock followed by faint knocking sounds. In my longer video I believe three different knocking locations can be detected. Starting with one loud strike of a tree followed by faint knocking and then a more muffled hit followed by the same faint knocking sounds. Hoping to video anything moving around, I decided to continual my hike going up another 2.5 miles until inclement weather rolled in. I made it back to my truck at 4pm without seeing or hearing anything else. With me being the only one parked at the Sno-Park when I started my hike it's clear nobody was near me at the time of the knocking.

On the 5th day of my hunt I was looking over an open area that butted up to woods and I saw a shape at the tree line that was standing upright and appeared to be a person in a Ghille suit. I thought that was odd because it is required to wear hunter orange during this hunt. I then looked down to retrieve my binoculars that were resting on my chest and I raised them up to scan the area and the person or thing was gone. I scanned the area with my eyes and binoculars and did not see it again. The person or thing I saw was approximately 300 yards away from me and there weren’t very many hunters out on this day. I then moved on via foot to an area I haven’t hunted yet and after about a ten minute walk I saw a track on the ground that looked like a human bare foot mark in the dirt. I took a photo of it and looked around the area for more tracks but could not locate any. The area was mostly a logged area with short field type grass and just a little bit of dirt in the area. The size of the print was only about a size 11 size foot. I then continued my hunt and left the next morning."

We were on  WA- 104 NE and came up to the Center Loop mid-point to get on Center Rd to head to the camp site. We made a right turn on to Center Rd but it curves south under highway and driving for just a few minutes and coming out of a long curve to a long straightway, approaching mile marker (#3) moments passing side road called Dabob Road, a rock no bigger than a small apple came flying out of the tree line and hit my truck on the top of the hood near the passenger windshield wiper. I wanted to stop and get out investigate but my girlfriend was a bit nervous about stopping and did not want to stop. We continued to drive to our destination for a minute or two to process what just happened to us. Then we both spoke the word,  “Bigfoot”!  We both have no doubt in our minds that it was a Bigfoot that threw the rock. We believed it was not likely any kids throwing rocks due to the remoteness of the area or any close houses. The rock did not tumble off a cliff or hillside because the area was flat and due to the trajectory and speed of the rock, it came right at us. My girlfriend told me she saw something big and black at the tree line just before the rock hit. I did not see anything only the rock as it hit my truck. We both know the Olympics has tons of Bigfoot reports so I would not any doubt it was a Bigfoot that threw the rock. We pulled in to a gas station at 15 minutes later to get gas and I took a picture with my cell phone of the damage. We noticed an approximately (1) one inch chunk of paint missing where the rock hit. All the way to the campsite and for the next few days the thought of a Bigfoot throwing a rock and hitting my truck never left my mind and we continued to talk about it a lot. At some point in the near future I want to place a few game cameras back in the area just to see if I get lucky. There is no doubt in my mind that we had a Bigfoot experience."

As I came up a small hill with a turn, on the left side of the road, just off the road, I saw what appeared to be the silhouette of a sasquatch. I frequently drive this road and had not had a sighting before or since. What I saw was slightly taller than a speed limit/road sign. I looked away to check the road, and when I glanced back over there was nothing to see. I have tried to explain this as being tired, but I am awake at about 4am every day, so I’ve ruled that out. I checked this page and saw the report from the gal near the old golf course, which I live on the other end of that course. This sighting was not far from where she was when she heard her strange howl. What makes me say “if” I saw is that what I saw was gray, but I did not see any defining features other than that it was a straight on back view."

I discounted it stating likely deer etc. About hour later he went out to our car and heard another knock. At this point I started to think maybe it was a Bigfoot but actually hoping not. I went to bed around 10 pm and shortly after I got into bed and still wide awake I heard loud rock hitting side of the wall behind my head and then heard another less loud rock sound hitting the wall of the bedroom next to me on same wall side.

I didn't really hear what woke me so laid my head back down on the pillow and about 3 minutes later I heard something but I was awake and sat up in bed and listened. My first thought it was a bigfoot howl or yell, as it seemed so distant but so filling of the entire forest/valley. I said to myself nah it must be some humans partying or yelling at a cabin on a hill, or in another section of the campground. Then within another 30 seconds another one while I was still sitting up, head by the open window, and complete darkness, no other human noise, quiet time and all are sleeping, and no human could make this noise as we simply cannot transmit what I will call depth and broadness of that kind of distance. It felt like it was coming from miles away but it wasn't directional. This howl could pentrate walls or obstructions it felt like. This was beyond weird, unsettling, while still kinda exciting.

Our group was built of 4 persons staying the night in a free camping area. I do not remember the exact date only it was late August. The campground only had one trailer in the entire area, and it was a family with two small children. We were in two tents. I had drawn the short straw and was sleeping in the back of one of our vehicles. The campground is very remote (no cell service) one road in kind of situation. And runs along a river. It also coincides with free-range area for cattle. We spent the day playing games and hanging out at the river. The night was spent by the fire, typical camping trope. We all retired to our sleeping quarters. It was about 3 in the morning when I woke to rustling outside. I was in the back of the jeep had taken up, the windows were down, and the doors unlocked. It was pitch black outside and when I sat up and looked out. There hunched over the picnic table was a large black mass going through our stuff/trash. Yes I understand the variables at play in this situation. We had left our trash out, racoons or bears being the best bet. However the argument I have and what I know for a fact and what plays over in my head. This mass was almost leaning on the bench seating, and hunching over and cycling through our bags and trash. Not to mention later that morning once we had all got to go out and inspect the area. There was no mess, no trash scattered, or a scene that happens when animals do come into camp. When I saw it at first my natural instinct was (Bear) so I slowly rolled up the windows, and locked the doors. I watched this thing from about 15 feet away. An Absolute black mass in pitch dark forest, move from one side of the camp to the other. I didnt have a flashlight. Even if i used my phone, I was shaking with fear, for myself and my friends who were feet away in tents. I laid down and closed my eyes and just waited till light broke through the trees. When I sat up again with barely an hour of sleep, it was now 8 in the morning. And to my left was a massive Bull (Cow). It meandered around camp for a few minutes but didnt do anything. At first I chalked thats experience up to it being a cow. But the cow left distinct hoof marks and and the length of the cow was not what I saw. Not to mention this figure I witnessed was tall, I couldnt put a number on it. And it showed a certain dexterity only a ""biped"" sort of thing could. I wanna note that I have gone every which way to make this a bear. In my head I play it back and try to make it out as a bear and bear only, but it just does seem possible as such. Only till now do I see it as something else."

After a while of sitting and seeing nothing I hear a series of heavy sounding thuds that sound like they were in the rhythm of a person walking. I had no idea what it was. I thought maybe it was a deer bouncing away buy it didn't quite sound right. The thuds were almost cartoonishly heavy and loud. Then about 5 minutes later I hear what sounds exactly like someone banging two rocks together. I was still deeply confused as to what the sound could be. It sounded like it was maybe 40 or 50 yards away just into the tree and brush, out of sight. I got up and grabbed my rifle and started down to where the sound was. When I was about 10 feet from the trees I had the sasquatch epiphany, so speak, realizing it might be sasquatch. Every hair on my body stood on end as I made my way immediately back to the top of the bluff. I was still hearing the rock banging so I grabbed two rocks and banged them 3 times back at it. There was a pause and then I heard three bangs back. I went back and fourth with this thing for about 10-15 minutes. It would mimmick the number of bangs I would do. I do 2 bangs it does 2 bangs. I do 4 bangs it does 4 bangs. I was far too freaked out at this point two investigate further especially because it was getting dark. I made my way back to camp and shared the story. There's only one way to access that area and nobody else had been up there. My friends suggested maybe a bear was snapping it's jaws but there was a nearby gut pile from a deer my brother had shot earlier that day that was untouched. If a bear was in the area I would think if would have investigated the guts. Later I had my dad stand about as far away from me as I thought the sounds were and had him bang two rocks. It sounded exactly the same. I'm not sure what it could have been other than a sasquatch. We were the only people camping up that road."
72040,Report 72040: Possible sighting of a Sasquatch crossing Interstate 5 at north end of Centralia,Class B,2021-12-27T12:00:00Z,46.76017,-122.9896,2021,Washington,72040.0,"Bigfoot sighting 12/27 at 12:30 a.m on I-5 during the winter storm. Hello, I’m trying to find other people who may have seen the same thing I did crossing the freeway in the middle of the night and middle of the snowstorm last night.  There were about 3 or 4 other cars on the highway at the same time that would have seen this.  I’ve never followed Bigfoot sightings or reported one before but this seemed like the best option to try and reach other folks.  Seeing this thing really freaked me out. December 27 at 12:30 am during the winter snow storm I was driving home northbound to Seattle from Portland.  Flights into SeaTac were all canceled and I managed to get a flight from San Diego to Portland and decided I would drive home because Alaska Airlines was telling me it might be two more days before flights were rescheduled. At 12:30 a.m. I was driving on I5 northbound through Centralia.  After I saw this thing cross the highway I marked the location on Google Maps: (https://goo.gl/maps/nS15Gx3jcaVgdtPy9) but I was driving so give or take a couple thousand feet. It was 24 degrees outside, snowing, the roads were icy and snow packed, and it was dark, there were no street lights.  There was a tall cement median separating northbound lands from southbound, I thought it looked a little taller than normal, maybe 4 feet.  There was one truck about 100 yards ahead of me, nobody behind me that I can remember, and I think about 3 or 4 cars on the other side of the freeway coming southbound who all were close together and would have seen this thing like I did. On my right hand side (east side of freeway) was just dark forest for as far as I could see.  Out my left window (west side of freeway) I saw a bunch of tall parking lot lights in the distance and what looked like a factory or warehouse a little ways maybe a thousand feet from the freeway. I was hyper-focused on the road because of the dangerous conditions and freezing temperatures, and driving about 40 mph.  I saw directly in front of me what I thought was a black shadow floating westbound across the highway from the east side towards the median.  As I got closer I was maybe 50-100 feet away and realized (or assumed) it was a person and I thought to myself what the hell are they doing? Crossing the highway in the middle of the night, in the middle of a freezing cold winter storm, and in the middle of nowhere….   I slowed down to not hit them.  There were no cars stranded on the side of the road that I could see (I had seen a few during my drive), only dark forest, so who were they and where were they coming from I thought.  For a second I thought they jumped out of the truck ahead of me but thought there’s no way it’s moving 40 mph like me. I then noticed the way it moved, it effortlessly crossed the cement wall.  It didn’t even look like it jumped the wall, the whole traverse in front of me and across the median looked like it was gliding, or floating with an unusual ease. The way it moved really spooked me, but I saw it in my headlights enough to see it was a large humanoid form, and it was definitely not an optical illusion or floating debris like a trash bag full of styrofoam which I have seen in the past.  As I squared up with it I had slowed down, and it was already on the other side of the median.  I could see its silhouette with the distant parking lot lights backlighting it and I clearly saw the shape of a large head and shoulders and it looked like it was just walking at that point, literally just walking westbound across the other side of the freeway as about 3 or 4 cars were approaching it.  I saw some brake lights and brights from those cars and think that someone of them must have also seen this. I was shook up honestly. The way this thing moved was ghostly and the way it cleared the median was surreal.    And the shape of its head and shoulders looked just like what I’ve seen from Bigfoot imagery over the years, exactly the same. I drove back by the site my next day on my way to Oregon, during the day time, and confirmed that the cement median is a solid 5 foot high.  Based on the head and shoulders that I saw after it crossed the median and stood up, I'm going to guess it was about 8 feet tall."

When we arrived we checked out the area and found some rock piles on the creek bed next to our site. Figured these were probably made by kids from the last party that was there, thought it was a little weird the way they were spread out but didn’t think really anything of it. After setting up camp we saw quite a few deer and fawns were crossing over the river and through our campsite which we found pretty weird but we had set up next to a flat with a bunch of green berry bushes, next to a river, so bear territory and figured that was maybe why. Long story short right after night fall our first night we heard what we though was a bear. It was just inside of the tree line, about 10 feet away from us. It made a deep loud growl. My girlfriend headed up to the Jeep immediately after that and stayed there for the night. About an hour later I was up at the Jeep with her. Across the road (west side of 4390) I heard 3 solid knocks on a tree. It sounded very close. It sounded like the loud crack of a baseball bat, hard and solid against a tree. I shined my flashlight over in the direction of the sound but saw nothing. Pretty quickly I heard some branches snapping in the same direction. I shined my light again but saw nothing unusual. About 3-4 minutes later another solid smack against a tree. It was just one knock but 30 feet or so further away this time. I am 41 and have been in the forest consistently since I was 10 and have never seen anything weird. This has just really stood out to me. After 2 years it’s still really just bugging me so I figured I would reach out and see if through your experience maybe this could be logically explained?"

It was like nothing I have ever heard before. This was not a human or regular animal noise. They were not screams. They were loud, but somewhat low pitch if that makes sense. There seemed to be two of these beings making these sounds at each other, not just one. After the grunting whoops, came several loud wood knocks. It was either wood on wood, or a very heavy fist on wood. It sounded like one of the beings knocked a few times, and another one responded with more knocks from down the way. I knew what I was hearing was unexplainable and I was terrified. I Iaid awake for about an hour of silence and was able to fall back asleep."

I believe in August of 2010 at night I had smelled something very very bad like body odor at night. It was an august summer night my dogs (2 labs) just looked at the window and didn't even bark or move. But I remember earlier that night the dogs wouldn't even go outside.So it was about 2 in the morning and I got up and closed my windows because of the smell. That was the only time I had smelled anything like that ever. Then last summer 2011 in august again I was out hanging clothes to dry (I work 2nd shift) on the line. I could hear the coyotes barking from the other side of the lake which I live on and the coyotes barking out behind a horse pasture behind my place . My dogs were over by the lake.Then all of a sudden they came running to the driveway facing the pasture . They wouldn't go past the light of the house.And the weird thing was all the noises I was hearing like the coyotes and the night noises stopped. The dogs kept looking up the driveway and at the little bit of swamp next to the house.So after I got my clothes hung up I got into the house as fast as I could. One thing that made me think about what had happened was from watching your show. And even know I haven't seen one I do believe . I have also seen a wolf up here that was as large as the front of my car 4 feet tall at the back .It was the biggest wolf I have ever seen.

Our party consisted of 4 adults and 2 children.  We set up camp and had dinner in the South Campground.  After dark we began our first night op at 10pm.  We left my wife and the 2 year old in camp with the fire.  Nick, his pregnant wife Jennie, their 5 year old son Atticus, and I went up a small ridge above our campsite to begin.  We walked slowly working south east of camp and further from the campground.  After about 5 minutes we heard something in the woods following us intermittently we stopped and waited with lights off for about 4 minutes. We continued to walk and stop with lights off until we got about a half mile from the camp.  At this point Atticus, the 5 year old, was ready to go back.  We started back and then stopped to do some whoops.  I did two whoops spaced about 30 seconds apart, no returned noises.  We continued to walk and stop.  When we were halfway back we let Atticus try some whoops.  He did two about 30 seconds apart.  After his second whoop there was an immediate response from within a hundred yards of us.  It was a slightly higher pitch whoop than I have heard before.  We waited about 4 minutes before continuing to go back to camp.  When we were about 100 yards from camp we stopped.  Jennie and Nick remained with lights off as Atticus and I turned our flashlights on and returned to camp.  As they sat by a tree they both heard something approaching them from the direction of the returned whoop.  It got so close that Nick stood up.  Then it took “four large, quick, heavy steps” back.  When Nick turned his flashlight on nothing was seen.  They then returned to camp.  As we sat and debriefed in camp we heard noises around camp, but dismissed them as raccoons.  I was looking to the woods beyond camp and began to see orange eye shine.  I thought it was a single star, but it moved lightly and would leave and return into view.  The next morning I saw that where I was seeing the glow was well below the ridge line and could not have been a star. Nick and I traded places while sitting in camp and he saw the same shine leave and return a few times as well.  Nick and I returned to near where he and Jennie had sat to leave an apple in a tree.  We all went to bed around 12:30 am.  Nick, Atticus, and I slept in a tent while Jennie, Sara and Hagen slept in a small teardrop camper.  After falling asleep Nick and I both woke up abruptly at 1:35am.  We immediately looked outside the tent to see a raccoon on the picnic table.  When we made noises to scare it away we heard something else moving around camp. We listened for a while before returning to sleep.  At 3:10 am we were woke up again.  We listened for a while, heard nothing, and went back to bed.  In the morning Jennie told us what happened to them in the camper.  At 1:35 am she was woke up not by the raccoon on the picnic table, but by something large walking in the woods behind camp.  She heard us scare away the raccoon and whatever was in the woods walked off.  At 3:10 am something started to shake the camper.  She said the camper was moved back and forth 3 times.  Her reaction was to laugh out loud from inside the camper.  She laughed because Sara and Hagen were sleeping through the event.  The shaking stopped and she heard something retreat back into the woods."
59229,Report 59229: Knocks returned in the afternoon while hiking at Loew Lake,Class B,2018-03-25T12:00:00Z,43.21667,-88.31644,2018,Wisconsin,59229.0,"My father and I went to Loew Lake because I had heard there had been sasquatch activity in the area. We hiked the trails for about two hours without much luck finding anything. I did find tree structures near the area where hunting is prohibited, and I took a picture of each of the two potential tree structures we had found. So as we were heading back to our car after hiking for two hours, I decided to pick up a stick and try making some wood knocks. To our surprise, there was a response. Mind you, we had been hearing gunshots in the area, local wildlife, and the sounds of trees scraping against each other. And what we heard was a knocking noise we couldn't explain. I knocked once, and we heard a knock in reply. Then I knocked in a series of three, and we got a three knocked response. Then, the knocks started going rapid one after another. I then replied in the same fashion, knocking rapidly one after another. Then it stopped. I made several attempts later to try tree knocking again in hopes of getting a response again, but no luck. I had the idea that if it was a sasquatch, it figured out it wasn't communicating with another Sasquatch so it stopped replying. My dad and I both heard it and decided that it could have only been either another human being messing with us or it was in fact a sasquatch. This makes me want to look into the area more. Because we never heard that noise until I started tree knocking the first time. And then never heard the noise again. We ruled out the idea that is was just a wood pecker, because wood peckers make noise whenever they want and not really in reply to something. To my knowledge, nothing in our area in terms of animals could make a knocking noise such as that."

It was dark, with my headlights the only light source. In summary, while driving at approximately 50mph, an animal on all fours ran in front of my vehicle (2015 Ford Taurus SHO) - left to right/east to west.  I nearly hit the animal as it came within five feet of the front of my vehicle. My observation was only a split second, but it left a very big impression, mainly because it didn’t make sense (as explained in the last paragraph). My wife was in the passenger seat, but was on her phone texting, and she only looked up because I swerved to avoid the animal. She never observed it. Hairy and brown, I did not see the head, mainly because it was slumped down on fours, and the fast speed it was moving. My dimensions are approximate from my viewpoint as the driver 46” high (legs), 46” (long) torso = 92” or 7’6” if standing. (I took a tape measure, and immediately took approximate measurements after arriving to my destination five or six miles away). I’ve been vacationing in this area since 1975 as a child. It was not a black beer (brown beer are not indigenous to this area), it wasn’t a deer, wolf or coyote. With this in mind, I’m left with a lot of unanswered questions, and quite possibly someone else saw this animal too."

This is a very remote marsh area surrounded by hundreds of thousands of acres of state and National forests.  You can access this marsh zone via paths the DNR has to maintain Water levels and people do watch migratory birds from a couple observation areas along road. I was more on a walk with the potential to jump shoot some puddle ducks as you can see not a cloud around.  Nor were there ducks. Not even sure it is a sighting but seemed rather strange. Something told me to look behind me as I was going the opposite direction as the figure. After watching this object for a couple hundred yards I decided to grab my cell phone. It is a long way away but appears black, large, and fast.  We have bear, very few moose, wolves, and occasional Elk around.  Feel free to say it is a guy on a bike-riding in the peat moss, or a guy on a 4 wheeler in a prohibited motorized vehicle area. It appears to be bipedal and walking deeper into the swamp in the muck. It is hunting season and I wouldn’t expect a person to be dressed in all black in a public hunting area.  I tried walking in it and turned back after about 5 feet. With naked eye I could see much better. The figure seemed to float as it moved across the swamp. Again a guy on a bike? After my hunt, I returned to the only 2 access areas to see if there were vehicles with bike racks or people out for a peat bog run. There was nobody around. I have been to the Marsh countless times and have never seen something like this. Although the distance a bit far for video. Figure seems quite large. Clearly appears to be in muck. I have photos and video but iPhone is a long way away and i am not an editing expert.  I am sure video can be manipulated and enhanced. ——————————— [Further comments provide when he sent in the photos: “ Here are pics. Was hunting ducks in Powell Marsh, Wisconsin.   Video I have problems getting to send but have it running thu the muck   Any thoughts are welcome. Watched with naked eye for about 300 yards before I figured I should try to get some photos/video. The small road behind is top of dikes running through the swamp.  about 10 feet wide with deep water on sides.  Clearly in the marsh not on road.  Of course left GoPro at cabin so stuck with iphone camera..  Would be happy to say it is nothing so I could hunt peacefully without thinking of this. Seems quite large. Was fast.

No fire, red headlamps. Dark and silent night, with a bright moon peeking through dense clouds. Suddenly this humanoid/primate wooOOP. WooOOP. WooOOP. Repeated three times. My first thought was that it was a person messing with us, but as it continued it sounded less human and more ape. Insanely loud, and massive chest. I could feel the sound kind of like the bass at a concert. It scared all of us silent for awhile. It couldn't have been further then 100 yards, maybe much closer. It sounded like it was at the end of the dock, but was not. I did look back but it was far too dark to see anything. A few moments later, we heard what almost sounded like children chatting from the other side of the lake. Humaniod/primate, but small and further away. On the edge of hearing. Very bizzare. It wasn't until a few minutes after this event just when all the forest noises came back did I realize it was dead silent during the event. We tried to recreate the noise the next evening, and we couldn't come close in volume and depth of the woops. It wasn't a threatening or violent tone, but exceptionally intimidating. Made me feel small and vulnerable, but it was not a hostile or aggressive call. Whatever made that noise was massive. It is very simular to the ""Sierra Sounds"" wooping."

We had been stopping at the scenic overlooks taking pictures, and had just left the Williams River overlook, and headed south on 150.  There was a stretch of highway that was very straight and a downslope of about 4-6% about 1-2 miles south of the Williams River overlook.  As we were driving down, we both noticed something in the weeds between the road edge and the bank leading up to the woods on the west side.  At first I thought it was a deer, with its head and neck stretched up above the weeds.  It was about 300-400 feet ahead, and while we continued towards it, it spun around, similar to an about face, but with the head dropping and a semi-crouch as it was turning.  It jumped up onto the bank, reaching for a branch to aid in pulling itself up.  By the time it jumped, we were within 80-100 feet of it.  By the time we got to where it had been standing, it was nowhere in sight, and we could hear no sounds of running or branches breaking in the piney woods along the road.  We both noticed that the weeds at this point and all along the area, were even with the hood on the 3/4 ton Chevy pickup we were in, making the estimate on the height of the creature at about 7-7 1/2 ft tall.  The creature was a mix of brown, and brown gold fur, longer than deer hair, but not as long as collie fur.  I have never discounted that Sasquatch could be real, but this firsthand experience has removed my doubt.  As we left the area, my arms and neck were covered in goose-flesh, and we were both speechless for about 10 minutes."

I was wading on one side of a fork in the river with an island type feature in the middle of the two streams and heard the snap of twigs. I looked to the island and briefly saw a figure that was roughly 60 yds away, very tall and dark brown or black in color. At first I thought it was a person but there was no facial features I could make out at that distance it was all dark I assumed covered in hair. My next thought is that it was a bear, but it walked away out of view moments after I had eyes on it, on two feet, and carried a staff with it. The staff was large, probably st least 5-6” in diameter, larger than I believe a human could or would wish to use as a walking stick. The figure moved to my right, downstream and quickly out of view. I was frozen with fear and unarmed at the time so there was no way I was going to pursue it. I’ve only told a handful of people about it and most think it wasn’t true expect my wife who knows when I am being sincere. Earlier this month I visited my father who I now know is a Bigfoot enthusiast and told him about the sighting. He had urged me to report on this website so now I’m getting around to actually doing it."
