State,Details
Alaska,I've never been down there after dark again
Alaska,The arms were curled at it's side like someone with hands on handle bars
Alaska, His fur or hair looked to be about 3 to 4 inches all over the main part of his body
Alaska, Houses are on an average of about 100 to 200 feet apart with only the general area around and close to the homes cleared out
Alaska, The person who was taking the report was sort of rolling his eyes through the whole thing as he seemed to be writing it down on a piece of scrap paper-
Alaska,We were walking about 30 to 45 minutes when my cousin thought he saw something standing in front of us about 100 feet or so away
Alaska,"In shoe size it looked like it might have been like a size 13 or 15, There were 3 foot prints and about a minute later we ran for about ten minutes and we started walking and then we got to the road, about a mile away from the picnic area, where we were having a Mother's Day picnic  We started to race each other to the picnic area where our family members were"
Alaska, Some of the woods in the area are quite thick and in some places canâ€™t be seen into more than about 10 or 15 feet
Alaska," It continued to run away, jumped over a dead log covered in snow and disappeared into a group of trees and into the darkness"
Alaska,The first thing I really saw was really bright blue eyes
Alaska,It was starting to get dark
Alaska,"When I realized it might be a bigfoot, I freaked out and tore out of there"
Alaska,"Then I noticed how far up they were, the thing had to be about 8-9 feet tall"
Alaska, He was about 6 feet tall and looked to weigh about 200 lbs
Alaska,My daughter saw the feet....they were huge
Alaska," This thing was walking upright like a man, long arms and what looked like a long neck from the side"
Alaska,I called my partner but when turned back to look at it again it moved very quickly into the woods on two legs
Alaska,"It was a large dark form legs spread apart, this is what led me to think it was a person on a bike"
Alaska,Too big for a bear and the legs were too far apart
Alaska," He was a tall, odd looking fellow and I joked to myself when I first saw him."
Alaska, It had a fairly long gape in his walk..arms swinging with each stride
Alaska,Then we went over to where we thought the thing was and in the sand about an inch deep there was a footprint like a man's
Alaska,"She described the ""thing"" to have been about 3-4 feet above the bottom of the window"
Alaska,"She described the footsteps as a sound that someone very large walking on two feet, kind of like a ""stomping"""
Alaska,"When I went up to the house, my hair felt like it was standing on end, and I had goosebumps really bad"
Alaska," With one foot he pushed off with was more a normal running move, but the other foot he pushed off with propelled him upward (about a foot or less) and forward"
Alaska,We were trying to make it to the camp sites near the glachier but it started getting too dark even for us 
Alaska,"In one of the pictures that I took of this track, I placed my foot next to it on the ground, keep in mind I am wearing a size 13 boot"
Alaska,"On the way we had talked about unexplainable events or things such as bigfoot, and UFOs"
Alaska,"I am 5'4"" and my eyes just reach the bottom of the window, so I figure this ""thing"" must have been 7-8 feet tall"
Alaska,"It was rather dark, but there was light from the moon"
Alaska,"The rest of the thing was real dark, might have been black or dark brown"
Alaska,I truly believe we have a Bigfoot in our area
Alaska,It was only about 10 to 12 feet in front of me
Alaska, But I followed the tracks over the next small hill and as I came down the far side my headlight pointed right on the back of a bigfoot
