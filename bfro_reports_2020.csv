65679,Report 65679: Afternoon sighting of a bigfoot by motorist on Hwy 17 just north of Deer Park,Class A,2020-04-16T12:00:00Z,31.24305,-88.31126,2020,Alabama,65679.0,I was driving home from work in the afternoon and completely preoccupied with thoughts of my struggles. When my eyes caught something. However my mind was still not focused other than I was waiting for movement of sorts. It’s second nature to keep a eye out for deer in this area. When I finally noticed that I was looking at  something unusual.  I saw a tall hairy animal walking off into the woods (on two feet) from the road. It had long blonde to light brown hair all over. I never saw the face. I kept my eyes focused on the woods where it walked into. When I reached that spot I was completely shocked at the size that creature was. It had to be at least 9 - 10 feet tall. The only thing I could think of was Bigfoot. Note: I have never been a believer of Bigfoot before but what I saw that day is something I can’t stop thinking about.
67423,Report 67423: Sighting of a Sasquatch crossing forest road off I-20 near AL/GA state border.,Class A,2020-06-15T12:00:00Z,33.64341,-85.41961,2020,Alabama,67423.0,"Me and my wife and two girls were going to see my parents who live in Cleburne county AL and my daughter who had not long gotten her drivers license was driving and I was up front in the passenger seat and my wife and other daughter was in the back. We had just gotten of the interstate and had turned down the long back road that takes us to my parents . And as we came over a hill and something huge and black darted across the road on two feet and into the woods about 50 yards ahead . My daughter said what was that I was like I have no idea , it was massive and very wide across the shoulders and it’s head seemed to just sit on top of its huge shoulders, like this thing was taller and wider than anything I’ve ever seen and moved with unreal speed . My daughter didn’t really get a good of look at it she just seen something big zip across the road , but I seen it long enough to see it was standing up on two feet and really big and I guess what stands out to me the most is just how wide it’s upper body was  big enough to know that no other animal could even come close especially around here, and it’s height I’m just guessing but it seemed easily 8 feet  . I still can’t believe that something like this actually exist I mean how can something that big not be seen more ,you hear the stories but to see something like this that you can’t explain, and you know most people will not believe you but I guess now I’m a believer"

66109,Report 66109: Multi-witness daylight sighting along powerlines south of Bryant Pond,Class A,2020-09-26T12:00:00Z,44.34113,-70.61507,2020,Maine,66109.0,"Had a sighting yesterday. Oxford County, Maine. Was in the power lines clearing that runs through a friends land cutting a downed tree out of the atv trail. Was with 2 friends who asked me how far the land goes and if anyone lives down there. They had a sort of 1000 yard stare down the power lines. I look up to see what they were looking at and about 200 yards down the powerlines we see a massive bipedal creature walking towards us. It stopped when it noticed us and took a fast left turn into the woods. From the power lines to the road is roughly 400 ft of woods and has a trail about 30 feet behind where we saw the creature that goes straight to the road. I jumped on the 4 wheeler and made a straight shot down that trail to the road to try and get a closer view. It was completely gone. Made 400 ft through the woods and across the road out of sight in less than 2 minutes. While investigating the sand on the side of the road for prints we heard a short howl followed by 2 sets of 3 tree knocks."
65867,Report 65867: Daylight sighting along Lake Huron north of Lexington,Class A,2020-08-01T12:00:00Z,43.39116,-82.53918,2020,Michigan,65867.0,"On August 1st, 2020, my 3 sons and I were out for a day-trip drive along the Lake Huron shoreline, north of Lexington, MI. There's many stretches of wooded areas on the lake side of the road, and rural farmland on the west side, along this route. At approximately 12:50 PM, 1 and a half to 2 miles south of Port Sanilac, MI, we were driving northbound on M-25, and my oldest son (15 yrs), seated next to me in the front, said ""Oh my God"" and stared straight ahead. I was still driving, and asked him what was wrong. He didn't initially answer and his 13 year old brother (seated behind him in the backseat) also asked him what was the matter. He finally spurted out ""I just saw a bigfoot!"". I thought he was joking at first, as he's always been a notable skeptic of my interest in Sasquatch research. But he adamantly insisted he wasn't kidding and described what he saw in the woods on the east side (Lakeside) of the road. He said he saw a large dark figure walking south through the woods. He says it was too a dark in the canopy of the woods to see a face, but the reason he noticed it at all was that it was moving exactly like the figure ""in that old grainy footage that everyone always talks about"" (the Patterson footage). He says the arms were longer than its torso and that he could tell it had fur much in the same way you can tell a dog has fur from a distance, that it wasn't skin that he was seeing. It was definitely walking, not standing still, and it's arms were swinging. He guesses that it was around 100 yards or less away. He estimates that it was around 8 feet tall (he said his impression of it made him feel short. My son is 6' 2""). He says it had very broad shoulders. He was able to watch it for approximately 5 seconds as we traveled in the opposite direction that it was headed. As soon as he told me what he'd seen, I turned around and drove back to the location. Traffic was moderately steady, being a summer Saturday afternoon, so it took a couple minutes to return to the exact spot and then find a safe spot nearby to pull off. We didn't see anything at that point, but I pinned the area on my GPS. The exact coordinates are 43.391164, -82.539186"
67381,Report 67381: Sasquatch sighting by motorist 5 miles west of Ely,Class A,2020-11-09T12:00:00Z,47.87965,-91.97748,2020,Minnesota,67381.0,11/9/20 11:15 am West bound HWY 169 - 1/8 mile or so past Twin Lakes Road sign on left side of road. It was 6-6.5 feet tall walking on two legs crossing a smaller road off to left walking parallel to me driving. It crossed the road ditch to ditch with three steps. I had 3-4 seconds of clear view. I saw very clearly the creatures back and right side of body. I saw grey to brown long hair. Kind of like the coloring of a grey squirrel. The hair was wire like. It was about 2 truck lengths from my van. I laughed and told my husband and my kids I think I just saw Bigfoot haha. I told my husband what I saw stating it must be someone in a suit because I saw it clear as I would look and see a rabbit or a wolf crossing the road. He said that would have to be somebody really crazy since it’s the third day of deer hunting season.
65808,Report 65808: Couple sees a white sasquatch at Settle's Ford Conservation Area.,Class A,2020-07-23T12:00:00Z,38.46156,-94.14297,2020,Missouri,65808.0,"I was going to Settle's Ford conservation area with my girlfriend to look at the stars. We pulled up to a gravel parking lot with fields to the east and a tree line to the west. My girlfriend and I felt uneasy for some reason when we got out of the car, but it had only been our second time there and we didn't bring her dog this time around. I have a pretty powerful little spotlight flashlight with a zoom lens to really get a distant read on eye shine. I decided to do a quick look around with it and almost out it down when I thought i saw something out of place in the field. I don't know why it caught my attention, as I had just skimmed over it with my flashlight before bringing it back around to decipher whether or not I was looking at an animal or a tree. But I noticed it was a little more... white? I shined the light on this thing for no more than 3 seconds before it started moving west. This was 50 yards away, but the first thought that came to my mind was it was a man, and told my girlfriend to immediately get in the car. Once I jumped in I realized that it is nearly 1 am, there are no cars here, and nobody would be in a field dressed in white at the hours. It just doesn't make sense. I then pulled my car around back to the road in it's direction to try and take a closer look, but only 40 feet or so down the gravel road, the fog started to get heavy. Feeling incredibly creeped out, me and my girlfriend high tailed it back home. From the distance in the fog, I could tell it was white, upright, somewhat slender and VERY tall. The head was distinct from the rest of the body and it seemed to move at a little more than casual pace once it realized I could see it standing there. I know this was not a deer because I would see the rest of it's body and I know it wasn't another person because a singular person would be out of there mind to walk out into a field to hang out in the middle of the night. Plus it was way too tall.  I will not be going back to this area."

Beautiful day, just past junction NN driving about 40 miles an hour. As I looked to my left there stood a huge Bigfoot. Reddish brown long hair, about 3’ 1/2 ‘ wide across his chest. His arms hanging to his side, his hands were long enough to go past his hips. Stunning creature.  As I passed, he had already cleared the tree line, stood as to look back and fourth for traffic. We locked eyes and looked at each other till I was past him. He wasn’t startled, he just stood there as if he knew me. I smelled a musty odor in the air. He definitely was an Alpha Male. No fear. About 9’ tall. Huge. If I would of stopped, I feel like I could have shook hands with him. No photo. But I keep my phone on camera from now on. It’s day time sightings. Not night time.

As my husband and I often do, we were taking a short cut across the mountain here in western NC, heading home. As I was driving along the river, there was a very strange looking, what I thought was an odd looking man, and as we passed it, I said to my husband, "" That is a strange looking person,"" and as I looked into the rear view mirror, it stood up on the road and was watching us driving away, and that is when I realized what it really was. I told my husband that it is a Bigfoot!!! In a panic I drove away and my husband insisted that we turn around and go back. I was in tears from the fear, but we found an area to turn around and I do so.  As we approached that area, we saw it on the side of the road watching us. He was HUGE!!!! My husband got out of the car to get a better look and he couldn't believe what we were looking at. It had to be at least 8-9 feet tall, covered in long black hair all over it's body. It was massive. We were about 100 yards away and nothing was obstructing our view. I yelled at my husband to get back into the car and I managed to turn my jeep around and I got the heck out of there!!"

I didn’t see it come out of the woods but saw it right before it crossed the road in two bounds.  It was large, maybe 8 ft., covered in black hair or fur.  There was a difference in color in the face and hands.  They were lighter in color.  Once it crossed the road, it headed toward the railroad tracks and was gone by the time I got there.  This all happened within a span of five to six seconds."
35079,Report 35079: Dairy worker describes 5am sighting between Tappan and Clendening Lake,Class A,2020-03-04T12:00:00Z,40.30824,-81.24778,2020,Ohio,35079.0,"I worked on a dairy farm between Deersville and Tippecanoe, Ohio in Harrison County during high school. It was March, 1982 about 5:00 in the morning. There was a heavy frost on the ground, a full moon, and I could see fairly clearly due to the moonlight. I went to the outside paddock area to feed the replacement dairy heifer and started dumping the grain into the trough attached to the board fence when I heard a low grunt. The kind of grunt that someone makes from being in one position too long as you stand up. When I looked up, this figure was in the process of standing up. It was on the other side of a small creek that ran through the paddock approximately 50 yards away. The figure was standing next to the wooden hay feeder. It stood there for a few seconds then walked towards the other end of the pen closest to the woods. I only saw it for about 5 to 10 seconds but could hear it walking for approximately 30 to 45 seconds. I heard the sounds of footsteps crunching in the frost as it moved to the other end of the pen and then heard the squeaking sound of the fence being pushed down. The cattle were not spooked at all during this encounter and continued to eat. After we were finished milking, I went over to the hay feeder and couldn't find any prints in the ground as the frost was gone. The figure appeared to be approximately 7 feet tall which I estimated was a foot taller than me."
49653,"Report 49653: Two incidents, years apart, one auditory, one visual, near Smithfield",Class A,2020-08-14T12:00:00Z,40.29771,-80.75612,2020,Ohio,49653.0,I have had 2 experiences the first was in hunting season of 1995. While hunting with my friend out of a double tree stand my friend and I was waiting for our dad's to drive out the woods to us. At the same time a friend of ours was coming from around the opposite side of the hill. When he got to us we started to talk while waiting for our dad's to come through the woods. While we were talking we heard a very loud powerful scream come from the woods across the field from us. We had no idea what this could have been. Out of the three of us that witnessed this none of us had heard anything like that or wanted to go investigate what it was. We were scared even being armed with shotguns. Later we heard the ohio bigfoot recording howls and we agreed that it sounded identical. So we believe that we heard bigfoot years later. The second incident happened in the fall of 2002. My best friend and I were working on his wife's car and needed parts and it was getting late close to closing time for the parts store. So we took the back road to save time. While going down the road we came around a turn near the old coal mine scales and the headlights hit a bigfoot standing on the shoulder of the road. I slammed on the brakes and slide past it on the gravel road. I put the truck in reverse and looked at my friend and said did you see that? He looked at me wide eyed and said yes please keep going. I put the truck back in drive and drove off. We were quite shook up from the experience.
50856,Report 50856: Hunters encounter an 8' tall Bigfoot near Scio while clearing trails.,Class A,2020-02-29T12:00:00Z,40.40611,-81.13733,2020,Ohio,50856.0,"My cousin and I were leasing hunting land in Harrison County, near Scio, OH. It was on or about September 4, 2010. It was approximately 9 AM and we were clearing our four wheeler trails. The birds were chirping, squirrels were jumping, and wildlife was moving around. Suddenly, we noticed that all woodland sounds had stopped. It was very odd to us, so much so that we both stopped what we were doing and stood motionless. As we looked around, we saw a tall dark figure approximately 50 yards away standing behind a large tree. It was approximately 8' tall, with hair covering its body. It was standing upright and was looking out from around the tree. At first, we could only see about 1/2 of its face and part of its shoulder and left arm. We were both armed with pistols, which we quickly had in our hands. The stare down lasted approximately 30-45 seconds. I asked my cousin in a low voice... ""are you seeing what I'm seeing?"" He replied yes in a somewhat shaky voice. I said ""what is it?"" He said ""you know what it is"". We both knew it was a Bigfoot. A few seconds later it ran perpendicular to us. We got glimpses of it crashing through the thick brush as it was moving small trees out of its way. It ran completely upright. We saw it running for approximately 50-60 yards before it disappeared into the swamp. Even though the hair was standing up on the back of our necks, we slowly walked over to where it crashed through the woods. The small saplings it ran through were completely broken and bent over. We could not wait to get out of the woods so we fled the area. We did not see it again that hunting season, but made sure we were always well armed, even during bow season."

While we were outside, he seen something that scared him so bad that he drug me to the house. He acted as if I couldn't get the door open fast enough. When we got in and I got the door shut, he turned quickly and stared at the door as if whatever it was, was going to come through that door and get us. He is an Irish Wolfhound and he was very shaken. So, after I took my son to school that morning, I decided to look for tracks in the snow to see if I could find out what it was that scared him. This is when I found some unusual tracks, lots of them, like the ones we had seen on our property a year ago. So I took video, and a couple of still shots. And then I called Jim Thompson to come and look at them. "

It was completely dark outside by this time. We were going around 60mph. My husband was on high alert for deer. We were just talking to each other when we approached the right hand turn off to Wyandotte Rd. My husband fell silent. He saw a very large, very tall, bipedal creature running toward the road from the left hand side. Within a split second I also saw this creature as it continued approaching the road at a full run. It entered into the peripheral of our headlights and came within 2-3 feet of the driver side window. Comparing the creature to our truck, it had to have been nearly 8 feet tall, as it was slightly slouched while running and was a head taller than our truck. It had blondish red fur and domed shoulder/head area.  Since we were going around 60 mph as all of this happened, it ended up barely missing our truck and crossing the road behind us. We didn’t speak for 15-20 seconds until my husband finally said “What was that?!” We immediately turned around and traveled down Wyandotte Rd, in the direction it went behind us, but did not see or hear anything. We also used a spotlight from the truck to look along the road on both sides where we initially saw it but did not see any disturbance. The next morning we stopped at the exact spot again and looked for anything on the ground in the area but did not see anything."

It was located in Logan Ohio part of Hocking Hills area. Everything was normal till Friday. We all started smelling a nasty smell couldn't figure out where it was coming from. Didn't smell it in the cabin just outside. Late Friday night after midnight 2 people were on the deck and everyone else went to bed. They started hearing loud noises like branches breaking and felt like they were being watched. Sometimes it sounded like something was being thrown they thought it was one of us pranking them. Then came a loud bang near them so they ran in the cabin from the upper deck. The one guy came into my room and told me what was going on. So me and another girl went down to the kitchen area and we all started looking out the windows. I turned all the lights out. Within minutes the one girl yelled there it is. I went to the kitchen window and in the field right in front of me there stood a large black figure walking on two feet towards the cabin. We all started yelling what is that. It then all of a sudden turned and went back into the woods it came out of like it heard us. We then got everyone up we all went out on the deck and heard weird howling sounds that none of us have heard before. And loud noises like branches breaking. Then we heard the loud sounds in front of the cabin to the left. We all moved to the front and heard walking and branches breaking and seeing something moving around. That is where a footprint was found.
67875,Report 67875: Sighting by dog walker and more recent incident on Stone Church Trail (Wayne NF) NW of Shawnee,Class A,2020-02-15T12:00:00Z,39.63255,-82.26463,2020,Ohio,67875.0,"My husband and I have been hiking a local trail system in our area nearly every day since we got our dog in 2013. Over the years we have experienced several instances of wood knocking and did not think much of it in all honesty. More recently we have stumbled upon small trees (4-5 inches in diameter) that were twisted/broken in ways that a human could not achieve (in our opinion). All these instances combined over the years have not really made us feel unsettled or afraid, nor did we think it was anything too worthy of note; however, our most recent experience, which occurred over a period of a few days in September 2020, was unexplainable and I cannot go without reporting this any longer, as it has truly been bothering me since it occurred.  In September 2020, my husband and I were on an evening hike (approximately 4:30-5:00 pm) at the Stone Church Horse Trail System, which is a part of the Wayne National Forest in Shawnee, Ohio (Perry County) when heard what we can only describe as a “howling/roaring” sound. The noise occurred twice, and there was approximately a minute of silence between the two “howls/roars”. Sadly, I was unable to get my phone out quickly enough to record the instance, as it all happened so fast. My husband and I have never heard anything like it before. I was a bit unnerved by the sound and we quickly left the area and headed back home. We spent that night looking up the calls of animals native to Ohio, but none of the sounds we listened to even remotely resembled the sound that we heard that evening. A couple of days later, we went back out to the same trail system where we heard the noise. We stopped along the trail to allow our dog to get a drink of water. My husband was preoccupied with the dog, and I was just taking in the scenery. I happened to hear some rustling on the ridge above us, and when I turned to look, I saw what I can only describe as a very large, bipedal creature, walking between the trees and brush. The creature was far enough away that I could not make out its features specifically, but it was very large. It had dark colored fur/hair, dark brown or black in color. I cannot give an exact height measurement, but the creature appeared to be approximately 6 ft tall—This estimate is based upon our survey of the surrounding trees where the creature was sighted on the ridge. I called for my husband to look over at the creature, but it disappeared over the crest of the ridge into the forest before he was able to see. Additionally, more recently, specifically, February 13, 2021, at 4:57 pm, I unintentionally recorded a wood knock while recording video of my dog. This instance also occurred on the same trail where my husband and I heard the howling/roaring and I saw the bipedal creature in Sept. 2020. I do have that footage, and the wood knock can clearly be heard."

Field notes filed on August 18th, 2020 at 22:50 hours by Pleasant Hill Lake Park Ranger McLellan #915. On 08/18/2020 at 22:50 hours, Ashland County Sheriff's Office received a 911 call for unknown subjects throwing items at them from the woods at the Primitive Camp area located at Pleasant Hill lake Park in Ashland County, Ohio. Park Ranger McLellan was dispatched and arrived shortly on scene at campsite #417 and met with the caller Faith Steele and her family (husband and two kids). Witnesses advised that someone in the woods behind their campsite was throwing sticks or (rocks) at them and around their tent. Due to it being dark the witnesses could not see who was throwing things at them. The husband went on to say he first thought it might be kids messing around in the woods, but when he yelled into the woods he did not hear any voices or noises indicating children, so he did not believe it was kids. The witnesses said a few minutes later they heard strange loud or weird noises coming from the woods, at which time he made his young children go into the tent while he stood outside the tent with his small pocket knife out ""just in case"". Witnesses went on to say a few minutes later they heard a loud bang (or knock) as if someone had smacked or punched hard the side of the (wooden) outhouse restroom located nearby on the other side of the primitive camp. When they turned and looked in that direction they observed something run into the woods. The witness described what he saw as a tall, dark and hairy figure run and disappear into the woods. Witness said the first thing he thought of when he saw it was a Bigfoot. Park Ranger McLellan checked the area and was unable to locate anyone in the wooded area and did not observe any damage to the outhouse structure. These witnesses were the only people camping in that area of Pleasant Hill Lake Park at the time. No further investigation was warranted at the time."
67199,Report 67199: Daylight sighting on the Brazos River west of Weatherford,Class A,2020-10-23T12:00:00Z,32.66908,-98.03284,2020,Texas,67199.0,"Hello, my name is Ricardo. On Friday the 23rd of October, 2020, my wife and I were seeing if a restaurant in Texas was opened so we could have lunch. It was around 1 pm. The name of the restaurant is called the Catfish Cafe, located just West of Weatherford, Texas on Interstate Hwy 20, right next to the Brazos River. There was only one worker at the restaurant, and he told us that the restaurant would not open until 4pm. So, my wife and I decided to drive around the countryside in that area and kill some time until 4 pm. Immediately just west of the restaurant about 50 yards or so, is a bridge that goes across the Brazos River. We headed across it and stopped in the center of the bridge to look at the river scenery when we spotted a huge dark figure on the river wading in the water around ankle deep. This thing was about a quarter mile north from the bridge. At first we thought it could be a man that was kicking the water, chasing a possible fish or something, but looking at the object a little closer, we knew that it was not a man because it was dark, tall, and hairy. We believe that it was a bigfoot looking for his meal. We stayed there on the bridge for a good 5 minutes, as no cars were coming. We drove around for awhile after that and came back to the restaurant about 3:45 pm stopping again on the bridge to see if that thing was still there. It wasn't, and we then got our food to go and went back home to our house in Weatherford. You guys are the first people we have told about this incident."

I took a left turn onto E Rochambeau Dr., which parallels interstate 64.  It was a clear night, dark and around 8:55pm.  I know that it was after 8:50 pm and before 9:00pm, because I was hoping to get back to watch the 9 pm debate. My son made a comment about my speed, and I pointed out a 55 mph speed limit sign, as we passed it.  I rounded a corner and saw a brief small glitter, which lead my eye to see movement.  I quickly could tell that it was an upright, bi-pedal figure.  As it walked quickly from right to left, I immediately could see that it walked like a human, but it was extremely broad and huge.  The arms and upper thighs were so big that I could see the outline of muscles.  The figure was blacker than black, almost looking like an enormous shadow figure, but solid.  My lights only revealed blackness, no clothes, just one solid figure.  I could see from the middle of the face and most of the legs.  I saw no features, as it was walking, only showing it's side to me.  It moved smoothly and quickly.  I could not see it's feet, or the top of the head. It happened so quickly that I didn't have time to say look, to my family who was with me.  As soon as it stepped of the side, I immediately said, ""What was that?!"".  I was curious to where it went, and as I passed the area, I could see that it went into the woods. There were no cars, people or anyone else on the road.  There was one house a little further down the road that had a front porch light on.  I keep trying to understand the distance from my car to the area it walked in the woods, trying to understand the height.  What I saw was huge, no way could any human be as huge, tall, and broad as this.  Again it was black, so black, and my lights didn't reveal details which is odd.  My children were completely freaked out, so I did not stop.  I've returned twice to the area to look at the road and surroundings."

We arrived at the lake around 6 AM right at golden hour. When we got to the parking lol there was one other car parked in the lot. After grabbing my photography gear (camera bag/tripod) we began walking down the path towards the lake. I was looking off to my right hand side and clearly saw something that was all black and bipedal walking parallel with me about 15 yards away. It ducked behind a small tufa as I was watching it walk. I told my dad that I saw something walking on 2 feet and he said that he saw something moving over in that direction as well. I knew that there was a person in the same area as us since there was a car parked in the lot when we arrived so there was still a possibility that what I saw was a person dressed in all black, although it would be strange for a person to be walking off the path in the area where I saw this thing since we were still away from the lake where all of the points of interest are. My dad and I continued to walk towards the lake to shoot the sunrise. As we approached the lake there was another photographer who had their camera mounted on their tripod and was taking photos. At this point I realized that what I saw walking was not a person since the owner of the car who was parked when we arrived had just been accounted for. I did not think I would ever experience something like this in my lifetime. I wish I would have gone to the area where I saw it and looked for some evidence or footprints but I was too scared to stray off the path since it was able to disappear in the brush / tufas so easily."

My family and I took a trip to the Sequoia National Forest and were walking a trail near the Bear Hill Trail. I was taking pictures and videos of my children when I noticed a couple of footprints up the side of the hill.  The toes and heel indentations were very noticeable, very large and very deep into the dirt. The stride between the prints were approximately 6 feet apart. I also took photos and videos of the prints and with my foot next to them. What was very intimidating was that I am 6'6"" and weigh 380 lbs., so I'm no small guy at all. I wear shoe size 13 extra wide. These prints made my foot look childish. I tried my hardest to dig my foot into the dirt as deep as the prints were, but to no avail. Whatever made these prints had to be a considerably large animal. I then went back to the entrance of the Bear Hill Trail and walked up that trail and matched the area where I found the original prints, but higher up. It was there I found a third print and took a couple of pictures of that print as well, with one being my foot next to it to get the size. I have always been an avid believer in the Sasquatch animal, but I never thought that I would ever find anything like this."

My wife wanted our dog on lead as she was spooked.  After approx 1/4 mile I noticed  animal droppings that appeared large human shaped under the uphill undergrowth, spaced every 10-20ft.  I commented on the size and shape of the droppings with my wife and agreed they couldn’t be human as there were too many and under the branches of the uphill side  We discussed how they appeared to be marking a territory. The droppings continued for maybe 150ft. We continue down/East on the trail.  At about the 1/2 mile marrk a deer startled us running from the uphill side across the trail and down the other side. My wife was spooked and we turned around to go back. As we neared the spot where the droppings were I spotted a  single foot print on the uphill side partly hidden by branches. I took pictures using my water bottle and shoe(size 10) for comparison. I wanted to spend more time but my wife and dog were very agitated. I spent 5 minutes searching for a rock or log or anything that would fit in the form of the print thinking it must have been a rock to have left such a deep, clear impression. No luck.

All the other animals are to scared to come near the cabin and the sound was so loud it shook the wall where I was sleeping I had to move up to the loft to be able to sleep because I was on the first floor of the cabin.

I don’t know how to start this off but here it goes: I am a 35 yr male disabled combat veteran (Iraq/Afghanistan) I’ve hunted this land for the last 5 years ish. It was the 9th of October and I had camp set up. Wife was getting off early and the kids were in school. They were coming to meet me there in the afternoon. I decided to go see if I could locate a small pocket of elk and shoot some grouse. I took my SxS down a normal trail that I somewhat frequent looking for my last 2 birds. It’s a old log road that dead ends. Immediately shot 1 soon as I got off the SxS. Got him and figured hey it’s a dead end, I’ll walk this and see if I can find fresh elk sign. I can show you on OnX where I was and can explain the terrain. Anyway, walked down maybe 1/2 mile at the beginning I kept jumping birds but always opposite of where I was. I went to the left the jumped 50-60 yards other side... get to a good opening and see a few wolf tracks. Big pile of bear shit. Decided to head back to check on my dogs and wait for the fam. Walking back was dead quiet as in awkward quiet no chirps no nothing, not like when I walked down. I got almost halfway back to my side by side and heard a knock... I know what a woodpecker sounds like.. I am not a believer (well idk now). So I thought maybe another hunter was in the timber so I speak out loudly “ohhh tree knocking huh!!!""  Then 2 knocks, I started laughing “Sasquatch is that you.."" silence for probably 10-15 seconds then 3 knocks no special order just odd timing knocks.  I make a joke of it “Have u seen any grouse I need one more” no answer, few seconds later knocks 2-3 maybe 4 .. I joke “ knock twice if your in New Hampshire (joking quoted anchorman movie) no knocks .. So I look thru my binos, not cheap shit, vortex viper 12x50... I looked for at least a min. One knock while I was glassing.. Started to feel really uneasy. Out loud said, ""Alright dude it’s not funny, at least wave a hand so I can see where you are! Again, I am grouse hunting with my 12gauge pump and don’t want to pepper someone when they're hid and I try to shoot a bird!"" Quiet for probably 30-45 seconds. I am glassing (thinking maybe someone put a blind up or something) but nothing. I unload my bird shot and put my 2 buckshots in followed by a slug. I tell them they're gonna get it and they need to show them self. Nothing, Was about to walk up the direction and just didn’t feel right. Kept my buckshot in and started to walk fast for the next 20 mins to my SxS. Got to my ride and still dead quiet... OK my area, potlatch land (timber company). I rode from camp 8.7 miles. Friday mid day. This is a dead end trail. I did not see anyone all day. No tracks, no tire marks, nothing. I know I was the only one out there. Went back to camp waited for my family. Told my wife and she said “You grew up in these woods. I don’t think you're crazy but I wasn’t there.” I am not crazy. I spend probably 7-8 months of the year in this area, never anything like this."

My wife set her tent against the northwest part of the site. I was sleeping in a hammock and cocoon with a hammock tarp as my shelter southwest of her. My friend was also in a hammock/tarp southeast of my wife's tent. After setting up our sleeping arrangements, we started a fire with some fell wood that we found laying around the site. Once the fire was going good, we say down and reconstituted some dehydrated food that we hiked in. We drank tea and ate until our bellies were full. Afterward, me and my wife went to bed, while my friend stayed up and played on her phone. After a few minutes, she went to bed as well. To be perfectly transparent, I want to share a detail which may be of use to critics, but I know better as it relates to my story. Where I had my hammock, walnuts occasionally fell from the tree and hit my tarp and rolled off onto the campsite grounds. This was a common event and one I'm used to hearing as an avid hiker. I'm no novice to forest sounds and behaviors. The night progressed and the fire burned out. I remember poking my head out of the cocoon and looking at the fire to see how dim it was becoming. Because the campsite was so remote, I knew it would soon be pitch black. I remember a walnut falling the tree and striking my tarp. It rolled off into the darkness and found its resting spot. The fire grew dimmer and dimmer until I grew bored of watching it. I zipped myself within the cocoon and fell asleep. Sometime later, a loud thud woke from my sleep. ""Maybe another walnut,"" I thought. Only it wasn't. It couldn't have been. Nothing ever hit the ground. Nothing rolled away off the of my pitched tarp. My heart raced. As I said before, I am an avid hiker/camper and I always look out of my hammock and under my tarp to see what's in the cap, but this time was different. I froze and couldn't move. It was like an involuntary fear that I've rarely experienced. I stayed that way until I calmed down, but never mustered the courage to look outside of my cocoon. The next morning, the first thing my wife tells me was that a bi-pedal creature was walking around her tent last night. My friend said, ""Mine, too!"" I tell them, ""Something slapped my shelter."" I go on to explain that it wasn't a walnut that fell on my tarp, because it never it hit the ground. My wife then tells us both that she heard two howls several minutes later and that they were about 15 minutes apart. According to her, the howl sound like a sign that paused at a very high pitch then broke into two small howls, then paused and two more small howls. That repeated itself another time. Me and my friend did not hear not, likely because we had fallen back to sleep. We left that campsite knowing we had an unexplainable experience. Although my friend is hesitant to believe it was the big guy, she does not deny that something with two legs was walking around her that night. As for me, I remain convinced that something slapped my tarp. My wife believes it was because I was a man, while her and my friend were female. Regardless, something with two legs entered our camp, in the dead of night, in pitch blackness, and left us unharmed, but fearful to look outside. We all shared that sense of fear and dread that we felt, but left the park not seeing the big guy, but at least two of us believing we were in close proximity to it."

The Trail is a 9-mile loop starting at Spurgeon Hollow Lake looping north towards Delany Creek State Park then continuing east and south connecting to the Knobstone Trail. (The Knobstone Trail is rugged state-maintained trail that winds approximately 60 miles through the Southern Indiana hills). The trail then turns west diverging from the Knobstone Trail to return to the trailhead at Spurgeon Hollow Lake. The Spurgeon Hollow Trail is situated in the middle of the Washington-Jackson State Forest. The Spurgeon Hollow Trailhead is reached from a county road a few miles off state highway 135, then a half mile off the county road down a dirt/gravel lane crossing through a couple of dry stream beds. We arrived around 1:30 pm on Friday June 12, 2020. It was a sunny day with low humidity in the upper 70’s (which is why we chose to hike this day). From the trailhead the path continues for a quarter mile or so and parallels the lake on your right and steep thickly wooded hills on your left. At this point, the trail splits to begin the Loop. You can go left up the steep hillside (several hundred feet climb) or continue on your right along the Lake. On this initial Trailhead path, I heard two distinct knocks. We had gone most of the quarter mile. I heard the first sharp knock. Then a second or two later, the second knock. Both in the same general area – up the steep slope to the left. I stopped at the looked, but could not see anything because of the dense vegetation. There was no other sound. The knocks were sharp and moderately loud. They sounded like the report of a baseball coming off a bat. There were no other people on the trail. No one at the Lake. My Fiancé stopped and looked back at me. I asked her if she heard those knocks. She of course made fun of me and said “Oooo it’s a Squatch”. She hadn’t heard anything. We continued on. We took the left trail up the steep slopes and for the next 6 miles went up and down steep inclines and declines. Crossed several creeks. Then about 3 hours later, the trail turned left diverging from the Knobstone Trail heading back towards Spurgeon Hollow Lake. The trail at this point parallels a large creek bed at the bottom of hills. We had gone a mile or so (about 2+ miles to go to reach the Trailhead). There was a knock. A very loud, very sharp knock. We both stopped dead. My fiancé’s eyes were wide as saucers. She said “that was loud”. I laughed and said “so what do you think that was?” The knock sounded again like the crack of a baseball coming off a bat. A huge baseball and a huge bat! It came from the steep hill top above us. We scanned the ridgeline, but could not see much. It was just too thick. I heard the brief sound of something moving in the brush up high, but that was it. My Fiancé said “Let’s Go”. I asked her “don’t you want to stay and see if something else happens?” She said “No I want to Go”. So we starting walking. A couple of times I would stop and scan the hills. She would say “Just keep walking”. We returned to trailhead with no further incident."

The calls were going back and forth and I realized we were surrounded. We kept talking loudly hoping to scare off any animals and kept my bear spray in hand for the next mile or so.

I am from Connecticut however I have spent years in desolate oilfields across the U.S. including places like West Texas, the upper Peninsula of Michigan, and the Everglades of Florida. I have a vast knowledge of wildlife as I have always taken an interest to it and spent years IN the forest. My point is, what I experienced this day has shaken me to the core as I know my encounter was nothing ""normal"". In the Northwoods of Maine in a town called Greenbush, (population 1,400) I purchased 80 acres of wilderness with virgin forest on the back half of the lot. (meaning not even loggers have been there, it's that desolate.) I had rented an excavator and for this entire day I had been cutting a road through swamp, hills and forests to a high hill I call Hope Hill on the virgin most desolate corner of my land where I want to build my cabin. I had made it halfway and in the swamp I realized I was out of fuel. I shut down the machine and get out. I step down onto to road and was admiring my work and just relishing in the whole idea of pioneering this new path. Suddenly about 50 yards into the tree line I hear a bang with a stick on to a tree. Like someone was hitting a wooden bat against a large tree trunk as the percussion was unmistakable... At first I thought ""Oh crap there is a moose"" because it is mating season for them and they are known to ram their antlers against trees to intimidate their foes. Suddenly, the sound happens again. Now I am certain this is no moose as no branches are breaking, there is movement, no grunts, nothing... Just this wooden thump just through the trees where I can't see. I begin walking further away because I'm obviously freaked out. Again, but now 2 knocks... I grab a large branch I had just ripped down with the machine and smacked it against a large tree trunk. Immediately I received a knock in response. I wait around 45 seconds.... I knock again, BANG it knocks right after me again... I knock again 5 seconds later, it responds again right back.... Now I am shaking because I know what I presume this creature to be. It's obviously strong because the bang was very loud. Intimidating... I knew there was a certainty I was interacting with Sasqauch. I went back to my trailer on my qaud which was parked about 200 feet down the trail. I FLEW home. I calm down, now I am questioning reality and am quite, scared I guess. This is my land, I'm only halfway through making the road, these are my thoughts, so I decide to ride back... I knock again. It responds. I take my phone out. Turn on record on video, I knock, it goes away... Almost as if it knew I was recording. Regardless it was incredibly perplexing. I got back on the quad and went back home knowing for sure what I just experienced was legitimate. I brought a feather bead string thing from a dream catcher and brought it out there as a gift. It's been 3 days. I haven't gone back to see if it's still there."

Since 2008 when I retired from the U.S. Navy, I have spent one month every year at my camp – 2 weeks in May, fishing and 2 weeks in November, hunting.  I have spent many days and nights in the most remote areas of that part of Maine. On the evening of November 12th  2020, my wife and I had returned to our camp after an afternoon deer hunt, it was dark by the time we got back to camp and settled in for a routine evening with getting the camp warmed up, supper, a couple hands of cribbage and talking – we had been in camp for 10 days.  At around 8:30 my wife decided to go to bed as we planned to hunt the morning.  I picked up my book and was reading until 10:30.  The only light within a half mile of my camp was the single gas light in the front room of the camp which I was using to read – the nearest people were 0.5 mile away in their camp back toward Route 9.  I decided to call it a night at 10:30 and wanted to relieve myself before I went to bed so I went outside across the porch, down the front steps and walked approximately 15 feet to the back outside corner of the camp.  Within seconds of standing in that spot there was two very loud “THWACK” sounds just inside the woodline which is 15 yards across the back yard.  It took me by surprise as I’ve never heard that sound before completely by myself in the woods.  It sounded identical to someone taking a large stick of firewood and hitting a tree in full swing.  I could easily replicate that noise as in knocking snow/ice off firewood against a tree, but with force.  I did not have a flashlight with me as the diffused light from the gas light inside the camp gave me enough point of reference to get back inside so I didn’t think to bring one with me.  I stood there perplexed as to what I had just heard and trying to make sense of it, when it happened again…”THWACK” but this time a little farther away – maybe 25-30 yards, but still quite loud.  This repeated itself 10 or 11 times over a period of maybe 2 to 3 minutes, each time a little more distant than before.  I remained standing there as I was still trying to figure out what it was “THWACKing” these trees.  After the hitting of trees dissipated, I returned to the camp and locked the door – I didn’t (and still don’t) know what it was but I knew it wasn’t a person, moose, deer or bear!  Of note, there was absolutely no light as in a flashlight from a person.  Additionally, those woods are extremely thick with dead spruce and fir – lots of blowdowns yet there was absolutely no noise – no snapping branches, breaking twigs. Nothing – Silence.  I can tell you first hand that nobody could walk down through there in broad daylight, much less at night without a flashlight without snapping branches and making a lot of noise. I spent an additional hour in the camp that night reflecting on what I had heard and trying to attribute it to something that made sense – there was none in all of my experience.  I went to bed and when we got up Friday morning, we decided to hang out at camp to get a start on packing and cleaning as we were closing up camp and leaving on Saturday.  I walked into the woods during daylight where I heard the “THWACK” noises the night before but found nothing where I expected to see some type of sign.  Needless to say, I didn’t tell my wife about those events until Saturday morning as we were getting ready to leave. I still have no idea what it was and it was so dark, I didn’t see anything but I can tell you that I’ve never heard or experienced anything like that in the many years I’ve spent in those woods and the 30+ years I’ve owned that camp."
65870,Report 65870: Possible daylight sighting near Missouri River and Katy Trail outside Hartsburg,Class B,2020-05-14T12:00:00Z,38.4125,-92.1855,2020,Missouri,65870.0,"Thursday, May 14th 2020. 10:30 am. South of Hartsburg MO. About 1500 hundred ft south of town on South Bush Landing Road. Hartsburg is a small community of around 100 people. The area is on the bottoms of the Missouri River. A bike trail called ""Katy Trail"" runs North and South through Hartsburg. My wife was taking care of her 93 year old mother and I decided to drive down to the river and look around. There were a lot of people riding bikes on the trail because of the pandemic going strong and no one could work or shop. It was a sunny warm day. I was driving south slowly when I looked up ahead on the road and I saw a big figure moving across the road in a very fast pace. Not running but, walking in big fast strides. It looked like vert big person, tall, thick, and brown in color all over. I thought it was weird for a guy to be walking across a farmers field coming east from the river and heading in a straight line to the bluffs. Farmers will ride their ATVs when they are in the fields checking on things. I thought it was wearing a heavy brown coat with a cone shaped hood. There was fresh planted soy in the fields and I could see this thing from head to foot. When I first saw it I was about a 100 yards away. I was driving slowly. By the time I reached where he crossed the road he had covered at least 200 yards and walking away from me. I had no camera or binoculars with me that day. I turned down a farmers dirt track road to head toward the thing. When I merged on the road and drove toward it, it turned North and headed toward Katy Trail. I never got any closer to him than the 100 yards and that was because it was moving very fast, swinging its arms. I drove on back to my folks house after that. "
66063,Report 66063: Fisherman describes large animal sounds in James Reed Memorial Wildlife Area,Class B,2020-08-08T12:00:00Z,38.521,-94.188,2020,Missouri,66063.0,"Several times a week I go fishing at the James Reed Memorial Wildlife Area just south of Lee's Summit, MO. It's about 900 acres plus 10 lakes to choose from for fishing and a area with walking trails. Each lake has a level, mowed area about 20 feet wide all the way round it. It is wooded and brushy between lakes plus there are also open meadow/fields scattered around. Animal life is deer (lots of them), fox, possums, rabbit, racoon, squirrel, turkey, geese, golden eagles, cranes, vultures and many smaller birds. During the week there aren't many people there fishing so sometimes I'm the only one. I prefer fishing at the lake that is farthest from the main entrance. I think Google Maps shows it as #9 but it has a name. The first week of August, 2020, I was there fishing for bass and had worked my way half way around the lake when I came upon a very large pile of scat in the mowed walking area. It was well formed and shaped like human feces.  I estimated its size as 16 X 14 inches and about 5 inches high. My first thought was an obese person had somehow managed to completely empty their guts. There are horse riders allowed in the area but I've never once seen their hoofprints around the lake in that area not any horse scat.  The pile did not resemble in any way what a horse does. The last week of August, 2020, I was the only person there and there were no other cars in the parking lot.  I was near where I'd seen the scat.  When I fish I move slowly and quietly. I was on the southwest side of the lake when I heard what I thought was a hoot owl. It hooted three times with no space between hoots. I've never hear an owl do that. I walked and fished for another 100 feet or so and was facing the water when in the trees/brush behind me I heard a deep HumphGrrrr sound. Both sounds were ran together and I could feel it vibrate in my chest. I immediately turned completely around thinking that there was a huge dog nearby and I wanted to make sure it wasn't sneaking up on me. The sound lasted about 3 seconds and even after I couldn't hear it I still felt it vibrate in my chest for a few more seconds. I looked as far back into the trees/brush as I could and saw nothing. I wasn't scared but I felt that I needed to leave so I left and went home. I was there fishing on Sept 8 or 9, 2020 (can't remember which day this happened). Same lake, same time, about 11 AM. I was on the northwest side of the lake casting for bass and I was the only one there. Earlier there was a young man fishing but he left about 10 AM. Except for the occasional bird and locust it was quiet. Suddenly in the brush behind me I heard what I can only describe as a small chimp making sounds like Cheetah the Chimp. I would guess the source of it to be closer than 50 feet. I heard it for perhaps a second or two then it stopped suddenly like someone had flipped a switch. I turned completely around and looked as far back into the trees/brush as I could. I even looked up into the trees on both sides of me and saw nothing. I moved a little faster and quickly worked my way around the lake to the parking lot then went home. That was as weird as the owl and growl I'd heard. This place is about one half mile outside of a city which is a suburb of Kansas City, MO. I do not have any mental illness, I do not drink, do drugs or smoke. I am a retired University teacher. Do you or anyone else have a possible explanation of what I saw and heard? I am really curious and want to know.  Now when I go fishing there I'm looking into the brush around me and up into the trees as I walk."

Although we were just on the other side of the river from town, the railroad was not running, the campground was closed, and the majority of the town was empty. This was a short day hike as we are seniors. We had a dog accompanying us (pit bull mix) for part of the way.  Before we reached the river we had to return the dog to the car- she became unusually excitable and fearful. Note: my friend and the dog live up on the mountain, the dog is used to wildlife and has treed a bear before. Anyway, windows down and dog much happier, we returned to our walk.  We had crossed the river and was on the trail that runs by the bank when we heard a series of hollow knocking sounds.  These were loud and resonate, not woodpeckers or falling branches.  A short time later they were repeated at a distance- the knocks sounded lighter in tone, like a hit on a more solid wood.  The knocks close to us responded- and we decided that it was in our best interest to leave the area."

First there was something moving through the wooded area to my left. Sounded like it was on two feet and moving towards some neighbors houses. Wasn’t alarmed by this, although it was dark and there was no flashlight the neighbors do walk through there from time to time. My dog wasn’t alerted at all. This part of the incident may be just coincidental but it’s what happened next that I’m curious about. About five to ten minutes later to the left of me way off in the distance there was an obvious wood knock then immediately to the right of me in the distance but in that direction is the Great Croton Swamp was a reply wood knock and then immediately after that another from the left. Then nothing. I’ve never heard anything like that before. It was about 11pm and the neighborhood was quiet and in my opinion it was an obvious call and response. Are wood knocks usually so instantaneous or do they usually have some time in between?"

We got into the woods before daybreak. As daylight was approaching the woods never got active. No animals or birds were heard or were visible. About 2 hours into the hunt, all was quiet. It was then that I heard a very loud wood knock. Startled the hell out of me. It was northeast of me in the swamp. My first thought was, ""You can't be serious."" A wood knock here? I stayed put for another hour, hour and a half. Then made my way back to my vehicle. My brother was already there. His first words were, ""Did you hear that wood knock?"" We discussed it and came to the conclusion that something weird was going on. About 3 weeks later during gun season the same damn thing happened in the same area."
30548,Report 30548: Two fisherman hear commotion of a roaring animal on brushy bank of Clendening Lake,Class B,2020-02-16T12:00:00Z,40.26059,-81.22332,2020,Ohio,30548.0,"I was 17 years old and fishing on a boat about 25 feet from shore. My father was with me and decided to take a nap on the deck of the boat. Suddenly I heard the sound of footsteps walking through water. It was a unique sound because it was a very distinct ""caploosh Gloomp"". ""caploosh Gloomp."" It sounded like when I have walked through knee deep water in the past. Then, I heard a roar like nothing I have ever heard before. It sounded angry and a bit like a lion. There was splashing and then the sound of a squealing animal in distress, followed by more splashing and more roaring. Immediately, I started looking around in all directions but could not see anything. The sound was so vivid. I felt I was in danger and that whatever was harming this small animal was going to harm me and may even jump in the boat. Paralyzed with fear, I used the quiet electric trolling motor to get as far away from shore as I could with creating any disturbance. I woke my dad up who was napping and he heard the tail end of the encounter and instructed me to immediately start the motor and get out of there. We headed back to the marina and went inside to get a snack and drink. We had not known what we had encountered or if anyone would ever believe us. We were discussing the incident between us. Just then, a man behind the serving counter asked us what was wrong and could sense the fear in our faces. We told him of our encounter and he did not seem to be surprised. He told us that a few years ago a news crew showed up at this lake to do a report on a ""Bigfoot"" sighting. Until that time neither my dad or me suspected a Bigfoot, nor had we heard of anything like it. From that point on, I have been convinced that it might have been. In my mind I ruled out a short or four legged animal because of the sound of the distinct footsteps in the water. The aggression of the splashing and roars could have only been made from a large animal. One thing to note is that the woods and forest surrounding the lake are very, very dense and have often commented to my dad that it would be very difficult to get onto the shore. I have told this story many times and have been ridiculed. I hope you will believe me."

The first encounter happened on a strip pond. We took a boat back to a spot along the high wall to where there was a flat spot to camp. We set up camp, fished, cooked, and then went to bed around 11 PM. At approximately 4 AM, I was awaken to heavy footsteps walking down over the near vertical high wall. It approached the tent and I heard heavy raspy breathing. After a few seconds, I cleared my throat. Then to my amazement, it cleared its throat mimicking me. At that point I started screaming I had a gun. My friend would not wake up for some reason. I finally calmed down some and could hear it walk down to the water. Once there, I could hear it sipping water out of its hands. After that, it walked back to the tent, sat for a minute then walked back up the hill. The next morning we found 18 inch tracks right on the edge of the reeds. About two weeks later, we were walking to a boat that was on a pond about a quarter mile away. Then, I saw what looked to be a ten foot stump with two eyes watching us. I told my friend and he blew it off as just a tree. So we went out on the pond and after a while we smelled a strong wet dog and feces smell. After that, we started to get scared so we went back to the spot where the boat was kept. We looked for the giant stump that we had seen earlier but could not find it."

We backed our truck up to the water, dropped the tailgate, built a fire and started fishing. This was around 9pm. The moon was so full we didn't need a lantern. It was very still and quiet out until we heard a few coyote's howl followed by some frogs croaking. Across the creek was thick with brush and small trees, there was a path that looked like led down to the water. While sitting on tailgate, we started to hear a sound of something walking down the side of the creek. You could hear it slowly taking what sounded like a two beat step. Too heavy for a deer, and too small for a coyote/cat. It hesitated at the pathway, then continued on to the left of us. It then made a loop to the right and came back up only farther away from the bank. Then we heard a hoot owl like sound very close to where we first heard the brush cracking. Then another hoot farther to the right as we could hear the footsteps fade in the distance. Then, about 5 minutes later, we heard a tree fall to the right of us across the creek where we heard the footsteps and hoot sounds. After all this the frogs started croaking again. We fished a little longer and decided it was time to leave."

Ancient,Class B,2020-04-12T12:00:00Z,39.42606,-84.10463,2020,Ohio,65393.0,"I was on the Little Miami Bike Trail heading back to Morrow from Oregonia...mile marker 23.5. It was Sunday, April 12, around 5:00 in the afternoon. Since the Covid restrictions were enacted a week or two prior, the trail had became so crowded every day of the week. However a cold front came in and it was a cool, cloudy day and very few people on the trail...maybe 15 to 20 riders encountered from Oregonia to Kings Mill...well, maybe more, but not bad. I'm retired and ride this route nearly day, weather permitting. So, after passing under the former Jeremiah Morrow Bridge (I-71 over Little Miami river) there's a long gentle arc in the trail. I haven't seen a soul since I turned around at Wilmington Rd. I'm cruising, it's nice and quiet, when suddenly I heard a loud knock...so distinct I instantly said in my head...that was a knock! It came from atop the hill to the east. I pondered all the conditions, i.e; kids playing..not!, cold, remote, and they don't play in woods anymore,..adult messing...maybe, but how would they know I was there?... natural, very doubtful, I'm nearly 68 and never heard anything so crisp, clearly, like a Louisville slugger full speed against a barkless solid ash tree (I imagined). There...that's what happened. I look online to see if any Bigfoot sightings had been reported in this area and found none. I stored the incident away until last weekend when I was talking to my son. He's 46 in May, I raised him near Morrow (abutting the former Frisch's Farm on the 3-C highway). Our school district includes the Maineville area. One of his good friends lived on a hillside, at a 90 degree curve on Sibcy Rd. His friend, Chris Flick's older brother told Nick, 20 years ago, he and his dad both saw a Bigfoot walking through the woods on the opposing (their house) hillside...two different times. Nick said he never related this until he told me...because of my knock story. He said he'll never forget it...and because of his story, I tell you my story...There!

At 3:39 we all woke up due to the sound of something knocking a tree behind us. Was in the distance but close enough to make you on edge. We thought it was a woodpecker and brushed it aside. 10 minutes later we heard the noise on our right side of the tent. The knocking was in triples such as “ knock, knock, knock” then a pause and the 3 knocks again, but in every direction the knocking had a slight variation. The knocking was coming from all sides of our tent, as if there was something surrounding us communicating. Knocks has slight variations in how quick they were, but all of them had the triple knocking. The closest knock was about 50 yard uphill from us. The close one made everything stop in the woods, it was raining and it stopped along with the wind. This is weird  considering it was super windy up there the whole time we stayed, except that one moment. We all agreed to not camp that spot again."

The tree was approximately  2 or 3 inches in diameter and absolutely no strong winds to push it over the whole week while I was hunting.  I do know that it was standing and not pushed over the day before. Seemed strange but continued to harness up and climb into my deer stand.  Still being very dark that morning I nocked an arrow and settled in to my stand.  Approximately 15 minutes after I shut my headlamp off,  I heard a distinct knock on a tree about 100 yards or so from my tree stand deep in the woods.  It sounded like someone hitting a large stick or baseball bat against a tree.   It knocked about 4 times then stopped and a few minutes later it knocked two times.  It was the strangest thing I have ever heard and the first time I have ever experienced it.  I know that nothing could have made that sound other than a person.

It had rained all day and had gone to drizzle by the time we arrived at our cabin around 4:30 pm. We unlocked the cabin and went inside and looked around and then went out right before 5 to start unloading our SUV. My wife grabbed some items and headed inside. Right as she got inside I heard a siren go off in the area of Beavers Bend State Park to warn about water being released from the dam. Immediately I heard a load deep growl. After a few seconds the growl turned into a deep howl. This went on for about thirty seconds and was immediately followed by a loud high pitched scream. This was followed wooooing sounds that lasted about 2 minutes. My wife came out while this was going on. We didn't discuss it as I didn't want to tell her what all I had heard. We grabbed up some items and went into the cabin. Upon coming back outside the sound was gone. I heard the siren go off many more times while we were there but never heard any other sounds. I am an army veteran and also former scoutmaster and have spent a lot of time in the woods but have never heard a combination of sounds like this. I'm still not certain if this actually was one or a coincidence of several animal calls occurring one after the other. My wife thought the woooing sound was wind blowing in the forest when we discussed this after we got home. But at the time there was little to no wind blowing and we never heard that again although it blew quite a bit as it rained the majority of time we were there. I originally sent this sound combination to Cliff Barackman and mentioned the Ohio howl and after looking it up it did sound similar to that. At the time I hadn't really thought much about Bigfoot since back when I was in junior high in the 1970's but after this have become really interested in it after this."

On the morning of the 12th just after 6am I was making coffee when I heard a guttural growling that rose to a higher pitch scream and then became a whooping sound, after which it dropped back down to a growl.  This sequence repeated three times.  My dog freaked out barking, but would not go past the saplings on the east edge of the camp, which is strange because he usually pursues deer, elk, and bears several hundred yards into the woods. I grabbed my bow and walked past the line of saplings, into an open forest that sloped down to a ravine with areas of dense vegetation.  I called my dog to follow, but he would not come.  The forest in this area is full of downed trees, where my sons and I had gathered firewood the previous afternoon.  I believe the sound came from the vegetation / trees at the bottom of the ravine, which we had been within 30 feet of when gathering downed wood. I only walked about 20 feet past the saplings, and stood on a log for a better view, but did not see anything moving.  I then decided to go back to camp, being a bit worried because my dog wouldn’t leave the area of our tent.  For the next hour and a half I sat with my bow next to me, the dog sitting between my legs, and listened to many instances of downed branches cracking beyond the saplings.  When the cracks stopped, it was abruptly, not fading as if the cause were moving away.  These were large branches being broken, similar to the sound of a bear breaking wood.  My dog is not afraid of bears and has chased away several, including one the previous week in eastern Idaho. About half an hour after the cracking sounds stopped the dog went out in the forest to investigate, and everything seemed to return to normal.  It was then that I again heard the squirrels angrily chirping and chittering at the dog, and realized that I had not heard it at all during the noises or cracking. I have never heard anything in the Blue Mountains, Rockies, or Cascades like this sound.  It sounded nothing like deer, elk, moose, bear, mountain lion, or bobcat.  The only thing I could possibly think is maybe a mountain lion was killing an elk, but it repeated three times with just about the same length and cadence.  And the whooping part of it reminded me of those plastic bellows hoses that you swing in the air to make a whistling / whooping sound. While in Pendleton a couple days later I was describing the sounds to a local hunter when an older native woman overheard and said she thinks it was a Bigfoot, and that she’s heard them on the Umatilla Reservation."

I will try to keep it simple. I had recently purchased a used vehicle and we decided to take it for a test drive to Laverne Park, which is just a short drive into the mountains from where we live. I was with my girlfriend, her 14 year old daughter, and my dog. After passing the park, we drove on further to see the country. We found a right turn and followed the rural road up into the forest. I later found out that we were traveling up Moon Creek. Not long after heading up the road, my car started overheating. I didn't have water on me so I decided to stop at the first water source, which was a bridge of the creek. I pulled over and we got out. While stepping out of the truck by girlfriend said, "" hey, there is something walking on the hill above us"". We stopped and listened for a moment but it was quiet. I then looked for a place to collect some water from the creek but it turned out that the edge of the water was too steep to step down and get water from. So, I had come up with a quick plan to connect some string to a cup and ""fish"" the water from the bridge. While we were trying to get the cup to fill, a small stone was thrown at us and bounced on the concrete of the bridge we were on. I looked up and noticed a steep hillside above us wondering what the hell could throw a rock at us. I noticed my dog was sitting in my truck, which she never does while I'm out of it in the wilderness. I was getting a little spooked so I tried to speed up the process of getting the water in the cup. Then, another stone bounced on the bridge next to us. I literally watched it skip along the cement. I mentioned that we better hurry, and then, from somewhere up the hill, came a very large rock, about the size of a softball of larger. It smashed against a huge rock in the creek and busted into pieces. I stood up on the bridge, looked at my girlfriends daughter and said, ""let's go now!"" My girlfriend and dog were already in the truck when I slammed the hood down and dove inside. We drove down the mountain and pulled over. I had left so fast that I didn't put the radiator cap back on. I considered returning after getting water to try to get pictures, but my girlfriend wouldn't let us go back. Now, either somebody was on that steep hill in the middle of the forest screwing with us and throwing rocks, or something else was. If it was a person, they are mighty brave in a forest full of hunters and guns. I don't know, seems awful strange."
65880,"Report 65880: ""Ohio howls"" heard not far from where recording was obtained in 1994",Class B,2020-04-11T12:00:00Z,40.60946,-80.3293,2020,Pennsylvania,65880.0,"The Saturday night before Easter 2020, I was sitting outside by a crackling fire, all alone. Was about 11:30 at night, and I had some music playing low on a small Bluetooth speaker. From way deep in the valley below me, and I mean it’s a huge expanse of woods back there, a couple miles to the next road, I heard a bone chilling ethereal howl.  Then I heard it again. Turned my music off, and listened intently.  I heard it three more times over the next minute or so. Too faint to record but loud enough to hear beside a crackling pine fire.  Each instance was three or five seconds long, sounded “WHOOOOHRRRLL”.  Started soft, picked up in intensity, then tailed off.  Whatever it was it was very loud, very powerful, almost resonated like a train whistle does from a distance.  I could also tell the sound was projected in different directions on a couple of the howls. I have spent a lot of time in the woods in my life. I'm an avid hunter, and an all around outdoorsman.  I'm familiar with the animals that live here in PA and I know I didn't hear one of them.  I know what barred owls sound like, coyotes, dogs, people... Pretty sure this was none of those. Whatever made that sound was large and powerful.  It stood the hairs on my neck. I sat listening for another half hour or so and didn't hear it again.  That's when my mind got to wandering.  I spent pretty much the entire next day (Easter Sunday) listening to recordings on YouTube and the like and a few sounded a lot like what I heard.  A supposed bigfoot recording from Westmoreland County PA and the 1994 Ohio Howl in particular were eerily similar.  What I heard was slightly higher in pitch than the Ohio sounds, but almost identical in tone change, cadence and duration.  It's worth noting that I actually I live about 15 miles east of the area where that was recorded."

I have lived here 12 years and have had strange things going on at my house since I moved here. But in the last 2 to 3 yrs, things have really started happening more. I live down a dirt road off of hwy 69. There are a lot of woods around me, also have several neighbors around me too. In late summer of 2017, I was jolted awake in the middle of the night by a loud banging on my house. I knew I wasn’t dreaming because I shot straight up; and at that exact moment, my two little dogs flew off my bed barking and carrying on. I stumbled into the kitchen wondering what could be happening and it was 2:38 am. My two big dogs outside were not barking, which I thought was odd. To make a long story short, I called the sheriff's department. Two deputies came out and found nothing. From that moment on, every 2 or 3 months, I have several incidents for a week or two, then nothing for another month or two or three, then things happen again. This past winter from Nov. 2019 to Feb. 2020, I have had several things happen. On three separate occasions while I have been propped in bed watching TV, I have heard a loud growl outside my bedroom loud enough to hear over the TV. It was loud and guttural. I have had tapping on the back of my house during the night. It is usually always around the same time of night. In Jan 2020, I was once again propped up in bed watching TV and over my TV, I heard something rubbing on the back of my house on the wall where my bathroom is. My bedroom and bathroom run together. My two little dogs jumped off the bed into bathroom at the back wall barking. I’ve had rocks thrown at my house.  I’m home alone most of the time. But this past Sat. night, April 18, 2020, my husband happened to be home. Between 11:00 and 11:30 pm, my dog started barking and wouldn’t stop, so I got up to holler at her to hush. As I got to my bedroom door, my cat was laying in my rocking chair next to my door.  I paused to pet her and about that time, I heard that same loud, guttural growl at my back door. My cat heard it, wheeled around, and looked at the back door. I went and woke my husband up. He looked out the back door and saw nothing. I went to the front door and opened it and called my dog. She would not get close to the fence and was barking, looking towards the back of my house towards my neighbor's home behind me. All of a sudden, she jumped back, like whatever it was was coming towards her. I ran to my guest room to look out the window facing that direction; and back towards northwest, I saw something huge and dark in color going across my neighbor's back pasture, moving fast. My neighbor behind me lives alone, and she has had the same things happening at her house. Sent from Yahoo Mail for iPhone"

65464,Report 65464: Vocalizations near the summit of Silver Star Mountain,Class B,2020-05-15T12:00:00Z,45.74796,-122.2389,2020,Washington,65464.0,"My girlfriend and I both had Friday off, 5/15/20, and decided to go do one of our favorite hikes up to Silver Star Mountain in Skamania County, Washington. We live in Portland and go up to that hike at least once or twice a year. We regard it as one of our favorite hikes in the area due to its proximity to home and its sheer beauty. I was born in rural SW Missouri, and then spent my formative years growing up in Colorado. I am an avid outdoorsman and spend a large amount of time backpacking, hiking, camping, snowboarding and surfing in the wilderness (as well as my girlfriend). I went to school for/work in environmental science and have years of experience collecting data in nature, including animal tracking and navigation. We left around noon and arrived at the Grouse Vista Trailhead and began our hike at 1PM. The hike is around 6.8 miles roundtrip and can be challenging on the way up due to the 2,000 feet of elevation gain to the top of Silver Star Mountain. The trailhead was filled with cars, although most of the foot traffic we encountered was on the way up as others were headed down. We like to hike in the afternoon for this very reason. We are both active/fit and didn’t stop on the way up except for once when nature called. Near the top, we encountered some snow (as was expected), but not nearly as much as the year prior. We finished the hike and were at the top of Silver Star Mountain. It was overcast with patches of sunlight, but no wind or rain and was generally pleasant. During that time, we were alone on the craggy peak and only a handful of other people were on the ridge to the south. The mountain is surrounded by valleys carving through the landscape on all sides. My girlfriend is in the medical field as was on call that day. She was digging through her backpack for her work phone to check voicemails (we had very limited service). I was rummaging through my pack for snacks. It was during this time that I heard the first series of very strange noises from the closest valley to the north. It was a distinct and loud “whoooo-ooop whooo-ooop”. The first “whoooo” segment of the noise was deep, with second “ooop” part having an extreme pitch change that I could not correlate to a known animal. I ask my girlfriend if she heard it, but she was preoccupied with her phone. It was around this time that a couple of other hikers showed up with their dog. We wanted to sit out on the rocks overlooking the views, so we moved slightly further down the ridge from them to a rock outcrop and ate some snacks and took photos (I can provide these photos for reference). In between conversation, the noise happened again from the same spot in the valley to the north. It was about 15 minutes from the first one. It was loud and filled the entire valley, giving me the feeling that it was a rather large animal. My girlfriend heard it this time and we both looked at each other puzzled. The other hikers behind us were carrying on conversation and didn’t seem to be paying attention to the noise, but their dog had kept going to the ridge and looking to the direction of the noise. We waited in silence to hear it again, but never did. We decided to head back down the trail. About halfway back down, the trail passes beneath Pyramid Rock. We had always wanted to scramble this rock to see the views and felt energized that day to do so. Pyramid Rock is comprised of loose talus and can be dangerous to climb. We picked our line going up the north side of the rock, which was rather steep, and came to a shallow cave toward the top. It was probably 20 feet wide and 20 feet high, but maybe only 10 feet deep. There were remnants of a campfire here, as well as a 4-foot wall or blind made of stacked rock around the entrance. After making it to the top, we decided we were hungry so we high-tailed it back home. Upon returning home, I decided to check BFRO for reports from Silver Star Mountain and found Reports #13115, #1652. These reports are from the exact area we were in. The photos included in Report #13115 were taken from the top of Silver Star Mountain where we were sitting and heard the noises. I would also like to note that the first few seconds of the Berry-Morehead “Whoops and Knocks” audio here on BFRO are nearly identical to what we heard that day."

We has built a fire and when the sun had set I mentioned to my wife that Sasquatch's are known to answer howls. I am on the BFRO site 4-days a week to track sightings and am a firm believer after reading Dr. Meldrum's book: Sasquatch-Legend Meets Science. I made a howl like the 1994 Moaning Howl Ohio call recording on this site. I am a trained vocalist and can project my voice loudly. I cupped my face and let out a howl. Its was answered. I was facing east and let out a howl every 30-60 seconds that was answered progressively closer. Astonished, I kept it up and the return was always closer. My wife fled to into the RV in fear. My son would not come out. I was not in fear but in hopes of seeing a Sasquatch. I did not have my cell phone with me to record the sasquatch returning howls. I grabbed my .44 magnum revolver (just in case) and a flashlight scanning the trees in hopes to see a illuminated red pair of eyes. As soon as I had my pistol in my hand there were no more returning howls. I was never in fear but in awe. There must have been 10-12 howls and returns. With the first reply. I would guess that the Sasquatch at least a mile away and with the last, maybe a 1/4 to an 1/8 of a mile if not closer. On 6/30/2020, we returned home and I had my wife and son listed to the 1994 Ohio howls. They were shocked that that was what they had heard."

This is not unusual as we live on a closed golf course which is adjacent to Riverside State Park and we often have varying types of nature near our home.  After letting the dog out to relieve himself I returned to bed.  Outside temp was approx 55-60 degrees and we had the bedroom windows open.  Our bedroom faces the closed golf course. What I heard next was a loud howl. At first I thought it was a police car or ambulance traveling on highway 291 that had turned on its siren, but then the sound simply went from soft to loud to suddenly stopping. So, it was not a siren.  I listened intently to try to figure out what was going on and about 2 minutes later I heard a similar but more faint ""siren"" sound. This was not a coyote or a wolf, nor was it the sound of a neighbor's dog.  The sound was different and as I said, it sounded like a siren with only one whooooooo. I noted the time (2:20am).  It sounded like it could have been a few blocks away (I thought around 7 Mile Road). I have been checking local websites and facebook groups to see if anyone else heard it, but so far nothing.  I can't be the only one to have heard this.  Perhaps a person was making the noise as part of Big Foot hunting?? The other thing I'd like to report is that we feed birds and squirrels in our yard.  Approx 6weeks prior we had our squirrel feeder torn off the tree at night.  We heard a crash outside and couldn't identify anything that particular night but the following morning we discovered the feeder's lid which is crewed into the top on a heavy hinge, was ripped off.  We jokingly said maybe we should look for Big Foot prints or hair in the area. Anyway,  the howl was definitely something not of the ordinary. Thank you."
66120,Report 66120: Vocals and track on Spencer Butte,Class B,2020-09-23T12:00:00Z,46.1725,-121.9305,2020,Washington,66120.0,"I was elk hunting this past week in the Mt. Adams and Mt Saint Helens areas. I headed up on a hike on Wed. the 23rd of September at a place called Spencer Butte. It's located Outside of Cougar and is a steep hike of 1800 elevation gain (it sits about 4300 ft). My friends and I headed up the hill in the morning at about 8:30 am. The weather was very rainy. We were trying to be very observant of any sounds or tracks. About half way up the mountain my friend turns to me and says 'did you hear that? it sounds like people yelling' I listened for a moment and heard what I would describe as a distant yowl...far up the trail. It was faint but distinct. We continued up the trail and eventually reached the top. My guess is it was about 10 am. Once we had reached the geological marker at the top, my friend and I began a search splitting directions. I continued through the trees and brush for about 75 yards from the geological marker and came to a clearing. I sat for a few moments and noticed that beyond the clearing...roughly another 35 yards or so was an alder that was shaking. I could just see the top of it, but there wasn't wind at the time and it was shaking intermittently. It happened several times. I thought I had an animal...possibly an elk pushing against the tree. I approached it and paused as I could hear something begin to move away. I then backtracked...grabbed my friend and he followed me over to the area. We proceeded to move around the area on either side hoping to see what it was. It was gone...Once I got to the tree I was surprised by how big the trunk was. Something big must of moved it. We split up again and I went back the way I came. As I was walking I came across a bit of mud and gravel. I noticed something very distinct. A Print. It was a left foot. I could see all of the toe outlines and it was much much bigger than my foot. I took a picture with my phone. We didn't have any other incidents but that sound, tree shaking and print are very compelling evidence. The location was also very compelling. The print was well away from the initial trail and geological marker. I have always been a believer, My grandfather researched and searched for bigfoot and before he died gave me his plaster cast from California. On another note, A few months ago had a very strange early morning (2:30 am) whistling experience, with eye shine earlier, movement and a dog that was very wary (but fearful) of something in the back woods near my house. I live in the Jim Creek area in Arlington, Wa. I can share more on that at a later date if interested."

I listened for a few more seconds and then got my phone out to record the knocking sounds. In my recordings you can hear one powerful knock followed by faint knocking sounds. In my longer video I believe three different knocking locations can be detected. Starting with one loud strike of a tree followed by faint knocking and then a more muffled hit followed by the same faint knocking sounds. Hoping to video anything moving around, I decided to continual my hike going up another 2.5 miles until inclement weather rolled in. I made it back to my truck at 4pm without seeing or hearing anything else. With me being the only one parked at the Sno-Park when I started my hike it's clear nobody was near me at the time of the knocking.

We were on  WA- 104 NE and came up to the Center Loop mid-point to get on Center Rd to head to the camp site. We made a right turn on to Center Rd but it curves south under highway and driving for just a few minutes and coming out of a long curve to a long straightway, approaching mile marker (#3) moments passing side road called Dabob Road, a rock no bigger than a small apple came flying out of the tree line and hit my truck on the top of the hood near the passenger windshield wiper. I wanted to stop and get out investigate but my girlfriend was a bit nervous about stopping and did not want to stop. We continued to drive to our destination for a minute or two to process what just happened to us. Then we both spoke the word,  “Bigfoot”!  We both have no doubt in our minds that it was a Bigfoot that threw the rock. We believed it was not likely any kids throwing rocks due to the remoteness of the area or any close houses. The rock did not tumble off a cliff or hillside because the area was flat and due to the trajectory and speed of the rock, it came right at us. My girlfriend told me she saw something big and black at the tree line just before the rock hit. I did not see anything only the rock as it hit my truck. We both know the Olympics has tons of Bigfoot reports so I would not any doubt it was a Bigfoot that threw the rock. We pulled in to a gas station at 15 minutes later to get gas and I took a picture with my cell phone of the damage. We noticed an approximately (1) one inch chunk of paint missing where the rock hit. All the way to the campsite and for the next few days the thought of a Bigfoot throwing a rock and hitting my truck never left my mind and we continued to talk about it a lot. At some point in the near future I want to place a few game cameras back in the area just to see if I get lucky. There is no doubt in my mind that we had a Bigfoot experience."

I frequently drive this road and had not had a sighting before or since. What I saw was slightly taller than a speed limit/road sign. I looked away to check the road, and when I glanced back over there was nothing to see. I have tried to explain this as being tired, but I am awake at about 4am every day, so I’ve ruled that out. I checked this page and saw the report from the gal near the old golf course, which I live on the other end of that course. This sighting was not far from where she was when she heard her strange howl. What makes me say “if” I saw is that what I saw was gray, but I did not see any defining features other than that it was a straight on back view."

When we arrived we checked out the area and found some rock piles on the creek bed next to our site. Figured these were probably made by kids from the last party that was there, thought it was a little weird the way they were spread out but didn’t think really anything of it. After setting up camp we saw quite a few deer and fawns were crossing over the river and through our campsite which we found pretty weird but we had set up next to a flat with a bunch of green berry bushes, next to a river, so bear territory and figured that was maybe why. Long story short right after night fall our first night we heard what we though was a bear. It was just inside of the tree line, about 10 feet away from us. It made a deep loud growl. My girlfriend headed up to the Jeep immediately after that and stayed there for the night. About an hour later I was up at the Jeep with her. Across the road (west side of 4390) I heard 3 solid knocks on a tree. It sounded very close. It sounded like the loud crack of a baseball bat, hard and solid against a tree. I shined my flashlight over in the direction of the sound but saw nothing. Pretty quickly I heard some branches snapping in the same direction. I shined my light again but saw nothing unusual. About 3-4 minutes later another solid smack against a tree. It was just one knock but 30 feet or so further away this time. I am 41 and have been in the forest consistently since I was 10 and have never seen anything weird. This has just really stood out to me. After 2 years it’s still really just bugging me so I figured I would reach out and see if through your experience maybe this could be logically explained?"
