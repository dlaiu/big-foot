# What do we know about Bigfoot?

This project started when I found this dataset:
https://data.world/timothyrenner/bfro-sightings-data/workspace/project-summary?agentid=timothyrenner&datasetid=bfro-sightings-data

There were quite a number of things I wanted to do with this dataset, but for the purposes of scope and timeline of this project, I decided to focus on visualising characteristics of bigfoot as a visual story.

# Data Analysis
Data analysis was pretty straightforward for this because it wasn't strictly speaking a number crunching story. 

The difficulty was reading all the reports and extracting the relevant characteristics for the visualizations.

I initially tried to use ChatGPT to parse through the whole dataset for me, but it wasn't able to systematically pull out all the characteristics of bigfoot.

I decided to do it the old fashioned way — reading every single report. 

To meet the deadline, I decided to focus on reports from 2020. My rationale was that I initially wanted to pivot the angle to focus on how sightings of bigfoot during Covid might have differed. However, after reading the reports, I noticed that the traits and behaviours identified didn't stray too far from other reports.

I tried to complement this approach through an interview with a bigfoot enthusiast and the man who manages the database. 

# Visualizations
Could be better. I wanted to sketch bigfoot or produce better pixel art but I was limited by both time and talent.

# Reflections
This was a fun dataset to play with. My dream story for this dataset is actually to see if there is a geographical pattern between bigfoot sightings and other conspiracies like extraterresterial or paranormal activity. With more time, I would work on a more in-depth feature into bigfoot enthusiasts in America.
